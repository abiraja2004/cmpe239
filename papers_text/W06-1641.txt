Abstract
Ranking documents or sentences accord-
ing to both topic and sentiment relevance
should serve a critical function in helping
users when topics and sentiment polari-
ties of the targeted text are not explicitly
given, as is often the case on the web. In
this paper, we propose several sentiment
information retrieval models in the frame-
work of probabilistic language models, as-
suming that a user both inputs query terms
expressing a certain topic and also speci-
fies a sentiment polarity of interest in some
manner. We combine sentiment relevance
models and topic relevance models with
model parameters estimated from training
data, considering the topic dependence of
the sentiment. Our experiments prove that
our models are effective.
1 Introduction
The recent rapid expansion of access to informa-
tion has significantly increased the demands on re-
trieval or classification of sentiment information
from a large amount of textual data. The field of
sentiment classification has recently received con-
siderable attention, where the polarities of senti-
ment, such as positive or negative, were identified
from unstructured text (Shanahan et al, 2005).
A number of studies have investigated sentiment
classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al,
2002; Dave et al, 2003), and at sentence level,
e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004;
Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy
is still less than desirable. Therefore, ranking ac-
cording to the likelihood of containing sentiment
information is expected to serve a crucial func-
tion in helping users. We believe that our work
is the first attempt at sentiment retrieval that aims
at finding sentences containing information with a
specific sentiment polarity on a certain topic.
Intuitively, the expression of sentiment in text
is dependent on the topic. For example, a nega-
tive view for some voting event may be expressed
using ?flaw?, while a negative view for some politi-
cian may be expressed using ?reckless?. Moreover,
sentiment polarities are also dependent on topics
or domains. For example, the adjective ?unpre-
dictable? may have a negative orientation in an au-
tomotive review, in a phrase such as ?unpredictable
steering?, but it could have a positive orientation in
a movie review, in a phrase such as ?unpredictable
plot?, as mentioned in (Turney, 2002) in the con-
text of his sentiment word detection.
We propose sentiment retrieval models in the
framework of generative language modeling, not
only assuming query terms expressing a certain
topic, but also assuming that the polarity of sen-
timent interest is specified by the user in some
manner, where the topic dependence of the sen-
timent is considered. To the best of our knowl-
edge, there have been no other studies on a re-
trieval model unifying both topic and sentiment,
and further, there have been no other studies on
sentiment retrieval. The sentiment information of-
ten appears as local in a document, and therefore
focusing on finer levels, i.e., sentence or passage
levels rather than document level, is crucial. We
thus experiment on sentiment retrieval at the sen-
tence level in this paper.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 introduces the work related to this study.
Section 3 describes a generative model of sen-
timent, which is proposed here as a theoretical
framework for our work. Section 4 describes the
task definition and our sentiment retrieval model.

ments, and gives our experimental results. Section
6 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
Some efforts for the TREC Novelty Track were
related to our work. Although some of the topics
used in the Novelty Track in 2003 and 2004 (Sobo-
roff and Harman, 2003; Soboroff, 2004) were re-
lated to opinions, most of the efforts were fo-
cused on topic, such as studies using term dis-
tribution within each sentence, e.g., (Allan et al,
2003; Losada, 2005; Murdock and Croft, 2005).
Amongst the participants in the TREC Novelty
Track, only (Kim et al, 2004) proposed a method
specialized to opinion-bearing sentence retrieval,
by making use of lists of words with positive or
negative polarities. They aimed to find opinions
on a given topic but did not distinguish or did not
care about sentiment polarities that should be rep-
resented in some sentences (hereafter, opinion re-
trieval). We focus on finding positive views or
negative views according to a given topic and sen-
timent of interest (hereafter, sentiment retrieval).
Our work is the first work on sentiment retrieval,
to the best of our knowledge.
In the context of sentiment classification, some
researchers have conducted studies on the topic
dependence of sentiment polarities. (Nasukawa
and Yi, 2003) and (Yi et al, 2003) extracted pos-
itive or negative expressions on a given product
name using handmade lexicons. (Engstro?m, 2004)
studied how the topic dependence influences the
accuracy of sentiment classification and attempted
to reduce the influence to improve the accuracy.
(Wilson et al, 2005) investigated how context in-
fluences sentiment polarity at the phrase level in a
corpus, beginning with a predefined list of words
with polarities. Their focus on the phenomena of
topic dependence of sentiment can be shared with
our work; however, their work is not directly re-
lated to ours, because we focus on a different task,
sentiment retrieval, where different approaches are
required.
3 A Generative Model of Sentiment
In this section we will provide a formal underpin-
ning for our approach to sentiment retrieval. The
approach is based on the generative paradigm: we
describe a statistical process that could be viewed,
hypothetically, as a source of every statement of
interest to our system. We stress that this genera-
tive process is to be treated as purely hypothetical;
the process is only intended to reflect those aspects
of human discourse that are pertinent to the prob-
lem of retrieving affectively appropriate and topic-
relevant texts in response to a query posed by our
user.
Before giving a formal specification of our
model, we will provide a high-level overview of
the main ideas. We are trying to model a col-
lection of natural-language statements, some of
which are relevant to a user?s query. In our ex-
periments, these statements are individual sen-
tences, but the model can be applied to textual
chunks of any length. We assume that the con-
tent of an individual statement can be modeled
independently of all other statements in the col-
lection. Each statement consists of some topic-
bearing and some sentiment-bearing words. We
assume that the topic-bearing words represent ex-
changeable samples from some underlying topic
language model. Exchangeability means that the
relative order of the words is irrelevant, but the
words are not independent of each other?the idea
often stated as a bag-of-words assumption. Sim-
ilarly, sentiment-bearing words are viewed as an
order-invariant ?bag?, sampled from the underly-
ing sentiment language model. We will explicitly
model dependency between the topic and senti-
ment language models, and will demonstrate that
treating them independently leads to sub-optimal
retrieval performance. When a sentiment polarity
value is observed for a given statement, we will
treat it as a ternary variable influencing the topic
and sentiment language models.
We represent a user?s query as just another state-
ment, consisting of topic and sentiment parts, sub-
ject to all the independence assumptions stated
above. We will use the query to estimate the topic
and sentiment language models that are represen-
tative of the user?s interests. Following (Lavrenko
and Croft, 2001), we will use the term relevance
models to describe these models, and will use them
to rank statements in order of their relevance to the
query.
3.1 Definitions
We start by providing a set of definitions that will
be used in the remainder of this section. The task
of our model is to generate a collection of state-
ments w
1
: : :w
n
. A statement w
i
is a string of
346
wordsw
i1
: : :w
in
i
, drawn from a common vocabu-
lary V . We introduce a binary variable b
ij
2fS; Tg
as an indicator of whether the word in the jth po-
sition of the ith statement will be a topic word or
a sentiment word. For our purposes, b
ij
is either
provided by a human annotator (manual annota-
tion), or determined heuristically (automatic an-
notation).
The sentiment polarity x
i
for a given statement
is a discrete random variable with three outcomes:
f 1; 0;+1g, representing negative, neutral and
positive polarity values, respectively. As a matter
of convenience we will often denote a statement as
a triple fws
i
;w
t
i
; x
i
g, where ws
i
contains the sen-
timent words and wt
i
contains the topic words. As
we mentioned above, the user?s query is treated
as just another statement. It will be denoted as
a triple fqs;qt;qxg, corresponding to sentiment
words, topic keywords, and the desired polarity
value. We will use p to denote a unigram lan-
guage model, i.e., a function that assigns a number
p(v)2[0; 1? to every word v in our vocabulary V ,
such that 
v
p(v)=1. The set of all possible un-
igram language models is the probability simplex
IP . Similarly, p
x
will denote a distribution over
the three possible polarity values, and IP
x
is the
corresponding ternary probability simplex. We de-
fine  : IPIPIP
x
![0; 1? to be a measure func-
tion that assigns a probability (p
1
;p
2
;p
x
) to a
pair of language models p
1
and p
2
together with a
polarity model p
x
.
3.2 Generative model
Using the definitions presented above, and assum-
ing that () is given, we hypothesize that a new
statement w
i
containing words w
i1
: : :w
im
with
sentiment polarity x
i
can be generated according
to the following mechanism.
1. Draw p
t
;p
s
and p
x
from (; ; ).
2. Sample x
i
from a polarity distribution p
x
().
3. For each position j = 1: : :m:
(a) if b
ij
=T : draw w
ij
from p
t
() ;
(b) if b
ij
=S: draw w
ij
from p
s
() .
The probability of observing the new statement
w
i1
: : :w
im
under this mechanism is given by:
X
p
t
;p
s
;p
x
(p

)

j=1
(
p

(w
ij
) if b
ij
=T
p
s
(w
ij
) otherwise
(1)
The summation in equation (1) goes over all pos-
sible pairs of language models p
t
;p
s
, but we can
avoid integration by specifying a mass function
() that assigns nonzero probabilities to a finite
subset of points in IPIPIP
x
. We accomplish
this by using a nonparametric estimate for (), the
details of which are provided below.
3.2.1 A nonparametric generative mass
function
We use a nonparametric estimate for (; ; ),
which makes our generative model similar to
kernel-based density estimators or Parzen-window
classifiers (Silverman, 1986). The primary dif-
ference is that our model operates over discrete
events (strings of words), and accordingly the
mass function is defined over the space of distribu-
tions, rather than directly over the data points. Our
estimate relies on a collection of paired observa-
tions C = fwt
i
;w
s
i
; x
i
: i=1::ng, which represent
statements for which we know which words are
topic words (wt
i
), and which are sentiment words
(w
s
i
). Each of these observations corresponds to
a unique point p
ti
;p
si
;p
xi
in the space of paired
distributions IPIPIP
x
, defined by the follow-
ing coordinates:
p
ti
(v) = 
t
#(v;w
t
i
)=#(w
t
i
) + (1 
t
)

) + (1 
s
)
sv
p
xi
(x) = 
x
1
x=x
i
+ (1 
x
): (2)
Here, #(v;wt
i
) represents the number of times the
word v was observed in the topic part of statement
i, the length of which is denoted by #(wt
i
). 
tv
stands for the relative frequency of v in the topic
part of the collection. The same definitions ap-
ply to the sentiment parameters #(v;ws
i
), #(w
s
i
)
and 
sv
. The Boolean indicator function 1
y
returns
one when the predicate y is true and zero other-
wise. Metaparameters 
t
, 
s
and 
x
specify the
amount of Dirichlet smoothing (Zhai and Lafferty,
2001) applied to the topic, sentiment and polarity
estimates respectively; values for these parameters
are determined empirically.
We define (p
t
;p
s
;p
x
) to have mass 1

when
its argument p

s
;p
x
corresponds to some ob-

(3)
Equation (3) maintains empirical dependencies
between the topic language model p
t
and the sen-
timent model p
s
, because we assign nonzero prob-
347
ability mass only to pairs of models that actually
co-occur in our observations.
3.2.2 Limitations of the model
Our model represents each statement w
i
as a
bag of words, or more formally an order-invariant
sequence. This representation is often confused
with word independence, which is a much stronger
assumption. The generative model defined by
equation (1) ignores the relative ordering of the
words, but it does allow arbitrarily strong un-
ordered dependencies among them. To illustrate,
consider the probability of observing the words
?unpredictable? and ?plot? in the same statement.
Suppose we set 
t
; 
s
=1 in equation (2), reduc-
ing the effects of smoothing. It should be evi-
dent that P (unpredictable,plot) will be non-zero
only when the two words actually co-occur in the
training data. By carefully selecting the smoothing
parameters, the model can preserve dependencies
between topic and sentiment words, and is quite
capable of distinguishing the positive sentiment of
?unpredictable plot? from the negative sentiment
of ?unpredictable steering?. On the other hand, the
model does ignore the ordering of the words, so it
will not be able to differentiate the negative phrase
?gone from good to bad? from its exact opposite.
Furthermore, our model is not well suited for mod-
eling adjacency effects: the phrase ?unpredictable
plot? is treated in the same way as two separate
words, ?unpredictable? and ?plot?, co-occurring in
the same sentence.
3.3 Using the model for retrieval
The generative model presented above can be ap-
plied to sentiment retrieval in the following fash-
ion. We start with a collection of statements C and
a query fqs;qt;qxg supplied by the user. We use
the machinery outlined in Section 3.2 to estimate
the topic and sentiment relevance models corre-
sponding to the user?s information need, and then
determine which statements in our collection most
closely correspond to these models of relevance.
The topic relevance model R
t
and sentiment rele-
vance model R
s
are estimated as follows. We as-
sume that our query qs;qt;qx is a random sample
from a distribution defined by equation (1), and
then for each word v we estimate the likelihood
that v would be observed if we sampled one more
topic or sentiment word:
R
t
(v)=
P (q
s
;q
t
?v;q
x
)
P (q
s
;q
t
;q
x
)
; R
s
(v)=
P (q
s
?v;q
t
;q
x
)
P (q
s
;q
t
;q
x
)
:
(4)
Both the numerator and denominator are com-
puted according to equation (1), with the mass
function () given by equations (3) and (2). We
use the notation q?v to denote appending word v
to the string q. Estimation is done over the train-
ing corpus, which may or may not include numeric
values of sentiment polarity.1 Once we have esti-
mates for the topic and sentiment relevance mod-
els, we can rank testing statements w by their sim-
ilarity to R
t
and R
s
. We rank statements using
a variation of cross-entropy, which was proposed
by (Zhai, 2002):

X
v
R
t
(v) logp
t
(v)+(1 )
X
v
R
s
(v) logp
s
(v):
(5)
Here the summations extend over all words v in
the vocabulary, R
t
and R
s
are given by equa-
tion (4), while p
t
and p
s
are computed according
to equation (2). A weighting parameter  allows
us to change the balance of topic and sentiment
in the final ranking formula; its value is selected
empirically.
4 Sentiment Retrieval Task
4.1 Task definition
We define two variations of the sentiment retrieval
task. In one, the user supplies us with a numeric
value for the desired polarity qx. In the other,
the user supplies a set of seed words qs, reflect-
ing the desired sentiment. The first task requires
us to have polarity observations x
i
in our training
data, while the second does not.
Task with training data:
Input: (1) a set of topic keywords qt and (2)
a sentiment specification qx 2 f 1; 1g. In
this case we assume qs to be the empty
string.
Output: a ranked list of topic-relevant and
sentiment-relevant sentences from the test
data.
Task with seed words:
Input: (1) a set of topic keywords qt and (2)
a set of sentiment seed words qs . In this
case our model ignores qx and x
i
.
1When the training corpus does not contain numeric po-
larity values x
i
, we assume (p
t
;p
s
;p
x
)=(p
t
;p
s
) and
force p
x
(x
i
) to be a constant.
348
Output: a ranked list of topic-relevant and
sentiment-relevant sentences from the test
data.
In the first task, we split our corpus into three
parts: (i) the training set, which was used for es-
timating the relevance models R
s
and R
t
; (ii) the
development set, which was used for tuning the
model parameters 
t
, 
s
and ; and (iii) the testing
set, from which we retrieved sentences in response
to the query. In the second task, we split the corpus
into two parts: (i) the training set, which was used
for tuning the model parameters; and (ii) the test-
ing set, which was used for constructing R
s
and
R
t
and from which we retrieved sentences in re-
sponse to queries.2 The testing set was identical
in both tasks. Note that the sentiment relevance
model R
s
can be constructed in a topic-dependent
fashion for both tasks.
4.2 Variations of the retrieval model
slm: the retrieval model as described in Sec-
tion 3.3.
lmt: the standard language modeling ap-
proach (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Song and
Croft, 1999) on the topic keywords qt for the
topic part of the text wt.
lms: the standard language modeling approach
on the sentiment keywords qs for the senti-
ment part of the text ws.
base: the weighted linear combination of lmt
and lms.
rmt: only the topic relevance model was used
for ranking using qt and for wt .3
rms: only the sentiment relevance model was
used for ranking using qs and for ws.
rmt-base: the slm model with  = 1, ignoring
the sentiment relevance model.
rms-base: the slm model with  = 0, ignoring
the topic relevance model.
2Because the training set was used for tuning the model
parameters, no development set was required for this task.
3When we use the automatic annotation that is described
in Section 5.2.2, we use the whole text instead of the topic
part of the text, for the reasons given in that section. This
treatment is applied to the base, rmt-base, rms-base, rmt-rms,
rmt-slm and slm models that are described in this section for
using the automatic annotation. However, we distinguish the
lmt and rmt models using the topic part of the text and the
lmtf and rmtf models, as baselines, using the whole text, re-
spectively, even in the experiments using the automatic anno-
tation.
rmt-rms: the rmt and rms models are treated
independently.
rmt-slm: the rmt and rms-base models are
combined.
lmtf: the standard language modeling ap-
proach using qt for the nonsplit text, as base-
line.
rmtf: the conventional relevance model was
used for ranking using qt for the nonsplit text,
as baseline.
lmtsf: the standard language modeling ap-
proach using both qt and qs for the nonsplit
text, for reference.
rmtsf: the conventional relevance model was
used for ranking using both qt and qs for the
nonsplit text, for reference.
Note that the relevance models are constructed
using training data for the training-based task, but
are constructed using test data for the seed-based
task, as mentioned in Section 4.1. Therefore, the
base model is only used for the training data, not
for the test data, in the training-based task, while
it can be performed for the test data in the case of
the seed-based task. Moreover, the lms, lmtsf and
rmtsf models are based on the premise of using
seed words to specify sentiments, and so they are
only applicable to the seed-based task.
In the models described in this subsec-
tion, 
t
and 
s
in equation (2) were set to
Dirichlet estimates (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001),
#(w
t
i
)=(#(w
t
i
) + 
t
) and #(ws
i
)=(#(w
s
i
) + 
s
)
for the relevance models R
t
and R
s
, respectively,
in equation (4), and were fixed at 0.9 for ranking
as in equation (5) for our experiments in Section 5.
Here, 
t
and 
s
were selected empirically accord-
ing to the tasks described in Section 4.1. The
model parameter  in equation (5) was also se-
lected empirically in the same manner. The num-
ber of ranked documents used in the relevance
models R
t
and R
s
, in equation (4), was selected
empirically in the same manner as above; how-
ever, we fixed the number of terms used in the rel-
evance models as 1000.
5 Experiments
5.1 Data set and evaluation measure
We used the MPQA Opinion Corpus version
1.2 (Wilson et al, 2005; Wiebe et al, 2005) to
measure the effectiveness of our sentiment re-
349
trieval models. We summarize this data set as fol-
lows.
 This corpus contains news articles collected
from 187 different foreign and U.S. news
sources from June 2001 to May 2002. The cor-
pus contains 535 documents, a total of 11,114
sentences.
 The majority of the articles are on 10 differ-
ent topics, which are labeled at document level,
but, in addition to these, a number of additional
articles were randomly selected from a larger
corpus of 270,000 documents.
 Each article was manually annotated using an
annotation scheme for opinions and other pri-
vate states at phrase level. We only used the
annotations for sentiments that included some
attributes such as polarity and strength.
In this data set, the topic relevance for the 10
topics is known at the document level, but un-
known at the sentence level. We assumed that all
the sentences in a relevant document could be con-
sidered relevant to the topic.4
This data set was annotated with sentiment po-
larities at the phrase level, but not explicitly an-
notated at the sentence level. Therefore, we pro-
vided sentiment polarities at the sentence level to
prepare training data and data for evaluation. We
set the sentence-level sentiment polarity equal to
the polarity with the highest strength in each sen-
tence.5
Queries were expressed using the title of one of
the 10 topics and specified as positive or negative.
Thus, we had 20 types of queries for our experi-
ments. Because the supposed relevance judgments
in this setting are imperfect at sentence level, we
used bpref (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004), in both
the training and testing phases, as it is known to
be tolerant of imperfect judgments. Bpref uses bi-
nary relevance judgments to define the preference
relation (i.e., any relevant document is preferred
over any nonrelevant document for a given topic),
while other measures, such as mean average pre-
cision, depend only on the ranks of the relevant
documents.
4This is a strong assumption to make and may not be true
in all cases. A larger, more complete data set is required to
perform a more detailed analysis, which is left as future work.
5We disregarded ?neutral? and ?both? if other polarities ap-
peared. We can also set the sentence-level sentiment polarity
according to the presence of polarity in each sentence, but we
did not consider this setting here.
5.2 Extracting sentiment expressions
5.2.1 Using manual annotation
Because the MPQA corpus was annotated with
phrase-level sentiments, we can use these anno-
tations to split a sentence into a topic part wt
and a sentiment part ws. The Krovetz stem-
mer (Krovetz, 1993) was applied to the topic part,
the sentiment part and to the query terms6 and, for
the retrieval experiments in Sections 5.3 and 5.4,
a total of 418 stopwords from a standard stopword
list were removed when they appeared.
5.2.2 Using automatic annotation
In automatic extraction of sentiment expres-
sions in this study, we detected sentiment-bearing
words using lists of words with established polar-
ities. At this stage, topic dependence was not con-
sidered; however, at the stage of sentiment model-
ing, the topic dependence can be reflected, as de-
scribed in Sections 3 and 4.
We first prepared a list of words indicating sen-
timents. We used Hatzivassiloglou and McKe-
own?s sentiment word list (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997), which consists of 657 positive
and 679 negative adjectives, and The General In-
quirer (Stone et al, 1966), which contains 1621
positive and 1989 negative words.7 By merging
these lists, we obtained 1947 positive and 2348
negative words. After stemming these words in the
same manner as in Section 5.2.1, we were left with
1667 positive and 2129 negative words, which we
will use hereafter in this paper.
The sentiment polarities are sometimes sensi-
tive to the structural information, for instance,
a negation expression reverses the following
sentiment polarity. To handle negation, ev-
ery sentiment-bearing word was rewritten with a
?NEG? suffix, such as ?good NEG?, if an odd num-
ber of negation expressions was found within the
five preceding words in the sentence. To detect
negation expressions, we used a predefined nega-
tion expression list. This negation handling is sim-
ilar to that used in (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et

were excluded for the evaluation of their work.

The upper and lower tables correspond to positive and negative sentiments, respectively. The topic-independent
sentiment relevance models (in the left two columns) correspond to rms, and the topic-dependent models (in the
rest of the columns) correspond to rms-base, which is used for slm.
larities, considering negation, as described above.
Note that we used the list of words with sentiments
to extract sentiment expressions, but we did not
use the predefined sentiments to model sentiment
relevance.
Some expressions are sometimes used to ex-
press a certain topic, such as settlements in ?Is-
raeli settlements in Gaza and West Bank?; but at
other times are used to express a certain sentiment,
such as the same word in ?All parties signed court-
mediated compromise settlements?. Therefore, we
will use whole sentences to model topic relevance,
while we will use the automatically extracted sen-
timent expressions to model sentiment relevance,
in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.
5.3 Experiments on training-based task
We conducted experiments on the training-based
task described in Section 4.1, using either man-
ual annotation as described in Section 5.2.1 or au-
tomatic annotation as described in Section 5.2.2.
Table 1 contrasts sample probabilities from topic-
independent sentiment relevance models and those
from topic-dependent sentiment relevance models.
In the left two columns of this table, two sets of
sample probabilities using the topic-independent
model are presented. One was computed from the
manual annotation and the other was computed
from the automatic annotation. In the remain-
ing columns, samples using the topic-dependent
model are shown according to the three topics:
(1) ?reaction to President Bush?s 2002 State of
the Union Address?, (2) ?2002 presidential elec-
tion in Zimbabwe?, and (3) ?Israeli settlements
in Gaza and West Bank?. A number of posi-
tive expressions appeared topic dependent, such
as ?promise? (stemmed from ?promising? or not)
and ?support? for Topic (1), ?legitimate? and ?con-
gratulate? for Topic (2) and ?justify? and ?se-
cure? for Topic (3); while negative expressions ap-
peared topic-dependent, such as ?critic? (stemmed
from ?criticism?) and ?eyesore? for Topic (1),
?flaw? and ?condemn? for Topic (2) and ?mistake?
and ?secure NEG? (i.e., ?secure? was negated) for
Topic (3).
Some expressions were unexpectedly generated
regardless of the types of annotation, e.g., ?pales-
tinian? for Topic (3); however, we found some
characteristics in the results using automatic anno-
tation. Some expressions on opinions that did not
convey sentiments, such as ?state?, frequently ap-
peared regardless of topic. This sort of expression
may effectively function as degrading sentences
only conveying facts, but may function harmfully
by catching sentences conveying opinions without
sentiments in the task of sentiment retrieval. Some
topic expressions, such as ?settle? (stemmed from
?settlement? or not) for Topic (3), were generated,
because such words convey positive sentiments in
some other contexts and thus they were contained
in the list of sentiment-bearing words that we used
for automatic annotation. This will not cause a
topic relevance model to drift, because we mod-
eled the topic relevance using whole sentences, as
described in Section 5.2.2; however, it may harm
the sentiment relevance model to some extent.

We performed retrieval experiments in the steps
described in Section 4.1. For this purpose, we split
the data into three parts: (i) x% as the training
data, (ii) (50   x)% as the evaluation data, and
(iii) 50% as the test data.
The test results of training-based task using
manually annotated data and automatically anno-
tated data are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respec-
tively. The scores were computed according to the
bpref evaluation measure (Buckley and Voorhees,
2004), as mentioned in Section 5.1. In addition
to the bpref, mean average precision values are
presented as ?AvgP? in the tables, for reference.8
In these tables, the top row indicates the percent-
ages of the training data x. It turned out that
in all our experiments the appropriate fraction of
training data was 40%. In this setting, our slm
model worked 76.1% better than the query like-
lihood model and 32.6% better than the conven-
tional relevance model, when using manual anno-
tation, and both improvements were statistically
significant according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test.9 When using automatic annotation, the slm
model worked 67.2% better than the query like-
lihood model and 25.9% better than the conven-
tional relevance model, where both improvements
were statistically significant. The rmt-base model
also worked well with automatic annotation.
5.4 Experiments on seed-based task
For experiments on the seed-based task that was
described in Section 4.1, we used three groups of

priate for the evaluation of our experiments than the mean
average precision.
9Significance tests involved only 20 queries, which makes
it difficult to achieve statistical significance.

consists of a positive word set qs

and a negative
word set qs

, as follows:
KAM : qs

= fgoodg, and qs
( )
= fbadg.
TUR: qs

( )

icism, fear, rejectg.
KAM and TUR were used in (Kamps and
Marx, 2002) and (Turney and Littman, 2003),
respectively. We constructed ORG considering
sentiment-bearing words that may frequently ap-
pear in newspaper articles.
We experimented with the seed-based task,
making use of each of these seed word groups, in
the steps described in Section 4.1. For this pur-
pose, we split the data into two parts: (i) 50% as
the estimation data and (ii) 50% as the test data.
The test results using manually annotated data
and automatically annotated data are shown in Ta-
bles 4 and 5, respectively, where the scores were
computed according to the bpref evaluation mea-
sure. Mean average precision values are also pre-
sented as ?AvgP? in the tables, for reference.
When using the manually annotated approach,
our slm model worked well, especially with the
seed word group ORG, as shown in Table 4. Us-
ing ORG, the slm model worked 61.2% better
than the query likelihood model and 15.2% bet-
ter than the conventional relevance model, where
both improvements were statistically significant
according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Even

using the other seed word groups, the slm model
worked 49?56% better than the query likelihood
model and 6?12% better than the conventional
relevance model; however, the latter improve-
ment was not statistically significant. The rmt-slm
model also worked well with manual annotation.
When using automatic annotation, the slm
model worked 46?48% better than the query like-
lihood model and 4?6% better than the conven-
tional relevance model, as shown in Table 5. The
improvements over the conventional relevance
model were statistically significant only when us-
ing TUR or KAM ; however, the score when us-
ing ORG is almost comparable with the others.
6 Conclusion
We propose sentiment retrieval models in the
framework of probabilistic generative models, not
only assuming that a user inputs query terms ex-
pressing a certain topic, but also assuming that the
user specifies a sentiment polarity of interest ei-
ther as a sentiment specification qx 2 f 1; 1g or
as a set of sentiment seed words qs. For this pur-
pose, we combine sentiment relevance models and
topic relevance models, considering the topic de-
pendence of the sentiment. In our experiments,
our model worked significantly better than stan-
dard language modeling approaches, both when
using qx and qs, and with both manual and auto-
matic annotation of the fragments expressing sen-
timents in text. With qs and automatic annota-
tion, our model still worked significantly better
than the standard approaches; however, the per-

formance did not reach that achieved with other
settings. We believe the performance can be im-
proved with larger-scale data.
We experimented to find sentences that were
relevant to a given topic and were appropriate to
a given sentiment; however, our models can also
be applied to textual chunks of any length, such as
at document level or passage level. Our model can
be easily extended to opinion retrieval, if the opin-
ion retrieval is defined as retrieving sentences or
documents that contain either positive or negative
sentiments. This issue is worth pursuing in future
work. Approaches considering polarity strength
or continuous values for the polarity specification,
rather than using f 1; 1g, can also be considered
in future work.
