Abstract
It has been suggested that some forms of speech
disuencies, most notable interjections and par-
entheticals, tend to occur disproportionally at
major clause boundaries [6] and thus might
serve to aid parsers in establishing these bound-
aries. We have tested a current statistical parser
[1] on Switchboard text with and without inter-
jections and parentheticals and found that the
parser performed better when not faced with
these extra phenomena. This suggest that for
current parsers, at least, interjection and paren-
thetical placement does not help in the parsing
process.
1 Introduction
It is generally recognized that punctuation
helps in parsing text. For example, Roark [5]
nds that removing punctuation decreases his
parser's accuracy from 86.6% to 83.8%. Our
experiments with the parser described in [1]
show a similar fallo. Unfortunately spoken
English does not come with punctuation, and
even when transcriptions add punctuation, as in
the Switchboard [4] corpus of transcribed (and
parsed) telephone calls, it's utility is small [5]
For this and other reasons there is considerable
interest in nding other aspects of speech that
might serve as a replacement.
One suggestion in this vein is that the place-
ment of some forms of speech errors might
encode useful linguistic information. Speech,
of course, contains many kinds of errors that
can make it more di?cult to parse than text.
Roughly speaking the previously mentioned
Switchboard corpus distinguishes three kinds of
errors:
 interjections (lled pauses) | \I, um, want
to leave"
 parentheticals | \I, you know, want to
leave"
 speech repairs | \I can, I want to leave"
Of these, speech repairs are the most injurious
to parsing. Furthermore, even if one's parser
can parse the sentence as it stands, that is not
su?cient. For example, in \I can, I want to
leave", it is not necessarily the case that the
speaker believes that he or she can, in fact,
leave, only that he or she wants to leave. Thus
in [2] speech repairs were rst detected in a sep-
arate module, and deleted before handing the
remaining text to the parser. The parser then
produced a parse of the text without the re-
paired section.
The other two kinds of errors, interjec-
tions, and parentheticals, (henceforth INTJs
and PRNs) are less problematic. In particular,
if they are left in the text either their seman-
tic content is compatible with the rest of the
utterance or there is no semantic content at all.
For example, Table 1 gives the 40 most common
INTJs, which comprise 97% of the total. (Un-
listed INTJs comprise the remaining 3%.) They
are easily recognized as not carrying much, if
any, content.
PRNs are more diverse. Table 2 lists the 40
most common PRNs. They only comprise 65%
of all cases, and many do contain semantics
content. In such cases, however, the semantic
content is compatible with the rest of the sen-
tence, so leaving them in is perfectly acceptable.
Thus [2], while endeavoring to detect and re-
move speech repairs, left interjections and par-
entheticals in the text for the parser to cope
with.
Indeed [6] nds that both interjections and
parentheticals tend to occur at major sentence
boundaries. Also [7] suggest that this prop-

Table 2: The 40 Most Common Parentheticals
erty accounts for their observation that remov-
ing these disuencies does not help in language
modeling perplexity results. This strongly sug-
gests that INTJ/PRN location information in
speech text might in fact, improve parsing per-
formance by helping the parser locate con-
stituent boundaries with high accuracy. That is,
a statistic parser such as [1] or [3] when trained
on parsed Switchboard text with these phenom-
ena left in, might learn the statistical correla-
tions between them and phrase boundaries just
as they are obviously learning the correlations
between punctuation and phrase boundaries in
written text.
In this paper then we wish to determine if the
presence of INTJs and PRNs do help parsing, at
least for one state-of-the-art statistical parser
[1].
2 Experimental Design
The experimental design used was more com-
plicated than we initially expected. We had an-
ticipated that the experiments would be con-
ducted analogously to the \no punctuation" ex-
periments previously mentioned. In those ex-
periments one removes punctuation from all of
the corpus sentences, both for testing and train-
ing, and then one reports the results before and
after this removal. (Note that one must remove
punctuation from the training data as well so
that it looks like the non-punctuated testing
data it receives.) Parsing accuracy was mea-
sured in the usual way, using labeled precision
recall. Note, however, and this is a critical
point, that precision and recall are only mea-
sured on non-preterminal constituents. That is,
if we have a constituent
(PP (IN of)
(NP (DT the) (NN book)))
our measurements would note if we correctly
found the PP and the NP, but not the preter-
minals IN, DT, and NN. The logic of this is
to avoid confusing parsing results with part-of-
speech tagging, a much simpler problem.
Initially we conducted similarly designed ex-
periments, except rather than removing punc-
tuation, we removed INTJs and PRNs and com-
pared before and after precision/recall numbers.
These numbers seemed to conrm the antici-
pated results: the \after" numbers, the numbers
without INTJ/PRNs were signicantly worse,
suggesting that the presence of INTJ/PRNs
helped the parser.
Unfortunately, although ne for punctuation,
this experimental design is not su?cient for
measuring the eects of INTJ/PRNs on parsing.
The dierence is that punctuation itself is not
measured in the precision-recall numbers. That
is, if we had a phrase like
(NP (NP (DT a) (NN sentence))
(, ,)
(ADJP (JJ like)
(NP (DT this) (DT one))))
we would measure our accuracy on the three
NP's and the ADJP, but not on the pretermi-
nals, and it is only at the preterminal level that
punctuation appears.
The same cannot be said for INTJ/PRNs.
Consider the (slightly simplied) Switchboard
parse for a sentence like \I, you know, want to
leave":
(S (NP I)
(PRN , you know ,)
(VP want (S to leave)))
The parenthetical PRN is a full non-terminal
and thus is counted in precision/recall measure-
ments. Thus removing preterminals is chang-
ing what we wish to measure. In particu-
lar, when our initial results showed that re-
moval of INTJ/PRNs lowered precision/recall we
worried that it might be that INTJ/PRNs are
particularly easy to parse, and thus removing
them made things worse, not because of col-
lateral damage on our ability to parse other
constituents, but simply because we removed
a body of easily parseable constituents, leaving
the more di?cult constituents to be measured.
The above tables of INTJs and PRNs lends cre-
dence to this concern.
Thus in the experiments below all measure-
ments are obtained in the following fashion:
1. The parser is trained on switchboard data
with/without INTJ/PRNs or punctuation,
creating eight congurations: 4 for neither,
both, just INTJs, and just PRNs, times
two for with and without punctuation. We
tested with and without punctuation to
conrm Roark's earlier results showing that
they have little inuence in Switchboard
text.
2. The parser reads the gold standard testing
examples and depending on the congura-
tion INTJs and/or PRNS are removed from
the gold standard parse.
3. Finally the resulting parse is compared
with the gold standard. However, any re-
maining PRNs or INTJs are ignored when
computing the precision and recall statis-
tics for the parse.
To expand a bit on point (3) above, for an
experiment where we are parsing with INTJs,
but not PRNs, the resulting parse will, of course,
contain INTJs, but (a) they are not counted as
present in the gold standard (so we do not aect
recall statistics), and (b) they are not evaluated
in the guessed parse (so if one were labeled, say,
an S, it would not be counted against the parse).
The intent, again, is to not allow the results to
be inuenced by the fact that interjections and
parentheticals are much easier to nd than most
(if not) all other kinds of constituents.
3 Experimental Results
As in [2] the Switchboard parsed/merged cor-
pus directories two and three were used for
training. In directory four, les sw4004.mrg
to sw4153.mrg were used for testing, and
sw4519.mrg to sw4936 for development. To
avoid confounding the results with problems of
edit detection, all edited nodes were deleted
from the gold standard parses.
The results of the experiment are given in
table 3. We have shown results separately
with and without punctuation. A quick look
at the data indicates that both sets show the
same trends but with punctuation helping per-
formance by about 1.0% absolute in both pre-
cision and recall. Within both groups, as is al-
ways the case, we see that the parser does better
when restricted to shorter sentences (40 words
and punctuation or less). We see that removing
PRNs or INTJs separately both improve parsing
accuracy (e.g., from 87.201% to 87.845|that
the eect of removing both is approximately
additive (e.g., from 87201% to 88.863%, again
on the with-punctuation data). Both with and
without punctuation results hint that removing

Table 3: Average of labeled precision/recall
data for parsing with/without parentheti-
cals/interjections
parentheticals was usually more helpful than re-
moving interjections. However in one case the
reverse was true (with-punctuation, sentences
 40) and in all cases the dierences are at or
under the edge of statistical reliability. In con-
trast, the dierences between removing neither,
removing one, or removing both INJs and PRNs
are quite comfortably statistically reliable.
4 Discussion
Based upon Tabel 3 our tentative conclusion is
that the information present in parentheticals
and interjections does not help parsing. There
are, however, reasons that this is a tentative con-
clusion.
First, in our eort to prevent the ease of
recognizing these constructions from giving an
unfair advantage to the parser when they are
present, it could be argued that we have given
the parser an unfair advantage when they are
absent. After all, even if these constructions are
easily recognized, the parser is not perfect on
them. While our labeled precision/recall mea-
surements are made in such a way that a mis-
take in the label of, say, an interjection, would
not eect the results, a mistake on it's position
typically would have an eect because the po-
sitions of constituents either before or after it
would be made incorrect. Thus the parser has
a harder task set for it when these constituents
are left in.
It would be preferable to have an experimen-
tal design that would somehow equalize things,
but we have been unable to nd one. Fur-
thermore it is instructive to contrast this situ-
ation with that of punctuation in Wall Street
Journal text. If we had found that parsing
without punctuation made things easier a sim-
ilar argument could be made that the without-
punctuation case was given an unfair advantage
since it had a lot fewer things to worry about.
But punctuation in well-edited text contains
more than enough information to overcome the
disadvantage. This does not seem to be the case
with INTJs and PRNs. Here the net information
content here seems to be negative.
A second, and in our estimation more serious,
objection to our conclusion is that we have only
done the experiment with one parser. Perhaps
there is something specic to this parser that
systematically underestimates the usefulness of
INTJ/PRN information. While we feel reason-
ably condent that any other current parser
would nd similar eects, it is at least possi-
ble to imagine that quite dierent parsers might
not. Statistical parsers condition the probabil-
ity of a constituent on the types of neighbor-
ing constituents. Interjections and parenthet-
icals have the eect of increasing the kinds of
neighbors one might have, thus splitting the
data and making it less reliable. The same is
true for punctuation, of course, but it seems
plausible that well edited punctuation is su?-
ciently regular that this problem is not too bad,
while spontaneous interjections and parentheti-
cals would not be so regular. Of course, nding
a parser design that might overcome this prob-
lem (assuming that this is the problem) is far
from obvious.
5 Conclusion
We have tested a current statistical parser [1] on
Switchboard text with and without interjections
and parentheticals and found that the parser
performs better when not faced with these ex-
tra phenomena. This suggest that for current
parsers, at least, interjection and parenthetical
placement does not help in the parsing process.
This is, of course, a disappointing result. The
phenomena are not going to go away, and what
this means is that there is probably no silver
lining.
We should also note that the idea that they
might help parsing grew from the observation
that interjections and parentheticals typically
occur at major clause boundaries. One might
then ask if our results cast any doubt on this
claim as well. We do not think so. Interjections
and parentheticals do tend to identify clause
boundaries. The problem is that many other
things do so as well, most notably normal gram-
matical word ordering. The question is whether
the information content of disuency placement
is su?cient to overcome the disruption of word
ordering that it entails. The answer, for current
parsers at least, seems to be "no".
