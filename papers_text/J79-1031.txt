T h i s  paper d e s c r i b e s  a s y s t e m  for a n a l y s i n g  natural 
language basea on the concept  of case. After a p r e l i a i n a r y  parse 
u s i n g  an augmented transition network, t h e  case routines attempt 
to find the appropr ia te  verb meaning. These rout ines  search for 
parts of t h e  s y n t a c t i c  structure which  best s a t i s f y  the 
requirements  of t h e  verb case frames and under b a c k - u p  are able 
to weaken gradually the c o n d i t i o n s  far success. The r e s u l t i n q  
structure is s i m i l a r  to the conceptual dependency  networks o f

B C'ASE-DRIVEN P A R S E R  FOR N A T U R A L  L A N G U A G E  
Brock H. T a y l o r  and Richard S. Rosenberq 
It has been a p p a r e n t  f o r  some t i m e  now t h a t  a l i n e a r  
approach to n a t u r a l  language  process ing  c o n s i s t r n q  of  soccessivcl 
s y n t a c t i c ,  semantic, and r e t r i e v a l  or in ference  p h a s e s  is 
i n a d e q u a t e .  An i m p o r t a n t  a d v a n c e  war; mad3 by Winograd[ 9.10 1 i n  
i n t e g t a t i n g  these p h a s e s  i n t o  a system w h i c h  utilizes the 
various  k i n d s  of l i n g u i s t i c  knowledge at t h e  a p p r o p r i a t e  trine. 
T h e  approach described in this p a p e r  is somewhat l e s s  a m b i t i o u s ,  
b u t  this is p a r t l y  compensated  for by its v e r y  flexible 
structure. In f a c t ,  it is u s e f u l  to v i e w  t h i s  system as a 
skeleton w h i c h  can be f l e s h e d  o u t  to serve  a v i d e  varlety of 
p u r p o s e s .  
A l t h o u g h  c a l l e d  a parser, it is f a r  more p o w e r f u l  t h d n  
t t a d i t  i ona l  parser because it incorporates  semant ic  k n o w l e d g e  to 
produce  a representat ion  of t h e  inpu- t  s e n t e n c e  w h i c h  i n  a s  rich 
as p o s s i b l e  in terms of t h e  system's b a s i c  k n o w l e d g e .  S i n c e  t h e

d e t a i l e d  operat ion of t h e  s y s t e m  v i L l  be d e s c r i b e d  s u b s e q u e n t l y ,  
we will now present the n a j o r  i n f x u e n c e s  on this uork ,  some 
similar sys tems ,  and what ue b e l i e v e  t h e  i ~ p o r t a n t  c o n t r i b u t i o n s  
to be. 
Beginning at t h e  end, we d e c i d e d  to represent an i n p u t  
sentence  with a structure which is v e r y  s i m i l a r  to the 
conceptual  aependency networks of %hank[ 5,6 1. This does not 
imp11 agreement w i t h  t h e  overall p h i l o s o p h y  of Schank, but 
rather a recognition that an u n d e r l y i n g  representation s h o u l d  
contain a s  much knowledge a s  p o s s i b l e ,  as i t  map be c r u c i a l  f o r  
subsequent a n a l y s i s .  As will be seen, our representat ion,  in 
a d d i t i o n  to the basic s y n t a c t i c  re lat ions ,  a l s o  r e v e a l s  s e m a n t i c  
relations not e x p l i c i t l y  g i v e n  in the input. s e n t e n c e ,  T h i s  
latter knowledge is d e r i v e d  f roa a c o n p l e x  s e a a n t i c  l e x i c o n  
organize& around t h e  c o n c e p t  of case as f i r s t  f o r m u l a t e d  by 
Fil lmore[3] .  One p o i n t  s h o u l d  be emphasized: Fillmore, as a 
l ingu i s t .  was concerned u i t h  foranIat ing a t h e o r y  to e x p l a i n  
d a t a  which a traxisfarmatioaal a ~ ~ r o a c h  s e e n e d  unable to ao, AS 
such ,  he felt the need to worry about t h e  number and na tu re  of 
t h e  cases necessary t o  treat the f i n g a i s t i c  data adequate ly .  
Thrs i s  to be contrasted with our approach w h i c h  is ta use an 
extended version o f  case in order to represent the meaning of a 
sentence as f q l l y  as p o s s i b l e .  The basic difference is revea led  
in  illn no re's aescription of five or six cases, whereas o u r  
system uses, at present, twenty-four cases. 
Perhaps t h e  tar. ncasetl is inappropriate  here, but there is 
anough s imi lar i ty  w i th ,  and motivat ion from, Pillmore's v o r k  
that we decided t o  use the term. The most complex part  of the 
l e x i c o n  is t h e  verb w i t h  its associated case frame: actually an 
e n v i r o n a e n t  of obligatory and opt ional  cases associated with t h e  
verb. One b a s i c  p r o b l e a  of sentence analysis is to choose among 
a l ternate  verb meanings for  an appropriate aandidate, This 
selection process i s  governed, in p a t t ,  by at tempt ing  to s a t i s f y  
the constraints imposed by the case frames associated with each 
verb  meaning. B u t  prior to a c t i v a t i n g  the case-driven p a r t  of 
t h e  system, a p r e l i m i n a r y  stage of analysis must be i n i t i a t e d .  
T h i s  i s  an almost purely syntactic p h a s e  carried out by a rather 
s i a p l e  augmented t r a n s i t i o n  network ( A  , (Roods[ 11,12 1).   he 
AT1 has proven to be very u s e f u l  in natural l a n g u a g e  process ing  
mainly because of the ease of r e p r e s e n t i n g  complicated and 
i n t e r r e l a t e d  s y n t a c t i c  structures, 
For our p u r p o s e s ,  t h e  ATH is used to produce  a very fast 
pre l iminary  parse of the i n p u t  s e n t e n c e  w h i c h  i n d i c a t e s  gross 
s t ruc tura l  re la tions, U s i n g  t h i s  parse, the c a s e - d r i v e n  
component seeks to select the appropriate v e r b  meaning. It i s  
importaat to note t h a t  if the Gase procedures fail on the f i r s t  
pass ,  c o n d i t i o n @  for success are progress ive ly  weakened u n t i l  
the most s u i t a b l e  meaning is chosen.  Although not a feature of 
t h e  p r e s e n t  system, it would be p o s s i b l e  to re-enter the ATN 
phase in order t o  produce another parse if the case p h a s e  were 
unab le  to complete its task in a s a t i s f a c t o r y  manner. 
Ye would l i k e  to stress those a s p e c t s  of the systea u h i c h  
aake it flexible and u s e f u l  for  a w i d e  range of l a n g u a g e  
process ing  applications.  It is straightforward to i nco rpo ra t e  
d i f f e r e n t  k i n d s  of knowledge necessary f o r  adequate processing.  
P u z  e x a ~ p l e ,  t h e  current s y s t e ~  has a procedure f o r  r e s o l v i n g  a 
f a i r  range of anaphoric references for pronouns .  If a d d i t i o n a l  
procedures are d e v e l o p e d ,  they can a l s o  be incorporated  i n t o  t h e  
s y s t e m ,  and will exert their inff iuence by a o d i f y i a g  the search 
procedures  for c a n d i d a t e s  which satisfy the reqa ireaents  of the 
case frane for verbs .  another important feature is t h e  f a c i l i t y  
w i t h i n  the dic t ionary  entries of nouns for p r o v i d i n g  i n f  oreation 
about relevant properties, such  as superset and subset .  Thus a 
k i n d  of semantic netuorh links nouns of the d i c t i o n a r y ,  and this 
knouleage is a v a i l a b l e  to a i d  in the p r o c e s s i n g .  
The user can construct the d i c t i o n a r y  appropriate  f o r  h i s  
purposes and can r e a d i l y  add necessary d o ~ a i n  specif ic  f eatares .  
This  system is c o n s i d e r a b l y  more than j u s t  a f r o n t - e n d  f o r  a 
t rad i t iona l  l inear language proaessor. ~t integrates  s y n t a c t i c  
and s e ~ a n t i c  l i n g u i s t i c  kflovledge in a p a r t i c u l a r l y  transparent 
and f l e x i b l e  mannet. 
There are other c u r r e n t  language s y s t e m s  u b i c h  are based on 
nations of case but which d i f f e r  m a i n l y  in the uap. the processed 
sentence is represented, U e  might mention ~ i m a o n s [ 7 ] ,  Martin[4] ,  
and Brace[ 1 1. 
The sys t em is written in LISP/!lTS, and runs on an IBB 370- 
168 under the HTS operat ing s y s t e m  at the U n i v e r s i t y  of B r i t i s h  
Columbia. The code occupies 240K b y t e s ,  and the current 
d i c t i o n a c y  of 450 words occupies an a d d i t i o n a l  90R b y t e s .  When 
the s y s t e m  is running t h e  t o t a l  s p a c e  used is 470K bytes. In 
s p i t e  of i t s  large size, it i s  r e l a t i v e l y  fast. For e x a m p l e ,  the 
t o t a l  time taken to parse s e n t e n c e  (11) below, is -90 CPU 
seconds, e x e c u t i n g  i n t e r p r e t i v e l y .  A con p i l e d  version of the 
progran uould run  approximately  10 times faster .  
2. Cages and Verbs 
The question a? how many cases we need to d e s c r i b e  E n g l i s h  
is a content ious  one, Pillaase[ 3 1  is vague on t h e  issue, whereas 
Celce-lurcial2 ] claims that five cases w i l l  do. The p u r p o s e  o f  
t h i s  work is to capture as much of the meaning of a sentence as 
i s  p o s s i b l e ,  and to make i t  e x p l i c i t  in a formal structure. 
Case, then, is an e x p l a n a t i o n  of the semantic f u n c t i o n  of a 
sentence part; theref ore a fairly large nonber of cases have 
been used, one for each of these "semantic f unctionsw. Ye are 
not adamant about our set of cases. The systea  is flexible and 
s t r u c t u r e d  enough, that the a d d i t i o n  or deletion of cases is a 
s i m p l e  operation. 
The sys tem was o r i g i n a l l y  designed w i t h  lartin1s[4] t h i r t y -  
odd cases as its b a s i s .  There are c u r r e n t l y  t w e n t y - f o u r  g e n e r a l  
cases implemented ,  p l u s  numerous verb-spec i f  ic cases. Some of 
Hartinas cases have been dropped c o m p l e t e l y ,  sone h a v e  s i m p l y  
not been i ~ p l e m e a t e d  p e t ,  and several new cases h a v e  b e e n  added.  
For a complete list of t h e s e  cases we refer you to 
TaylorC8 1. A feu will be l i s t e d  here, and they w i l l  later b e  
used to a i d  i n  the d e s c r i p t i o n  o f  t h e  systea. The u n d e r l i n e d  
phrases represent t h e  appropriate cases.

2.2 D e t e r r i n a t i a  of Case 
Bast of t h e  cases l i s t e d  above are a s s ~ c i a t e d  with the 
p r e p o s i t i o n s  that f l a g  them. This is, of course, a qross  over- 
s i m p l i f  %cation of the r e l a t i o n s h i p  between verbs.  p r e p o s i t i o n s ,  
and cases. A p r e p o s i t i o n  which f lags  one case for one v e r b  may 
very  well flag another case for  a different verb. 
(1) f walked about t h e  roaa. 
( 2 )  1 t a l k e d  abdut  the room. 
For verbs of movement l fker  "ualkt', naboutn f l a g s  the p a t h  
case as i n  ( I ) ,  but f o r  verba of communication l i k e  '#talkv(, it  
usually f l a g s  t h e  t o p i s  case a s  i n  ( 2 ) .  f l a r t i o [ 4 ]  notes this, 
and proposes for each verb raaning t o  list a l l  of the cases 
flagged by  each p r e p o s i t i o n .  This i n v o l v e s  a great deal of 
repetition, however, since n o s t  p r e p o s i t i o n s  flag almost t h e  
same sat  of cases for aost  verbs.  For this s y s t e n ,  therefore, we 
set up a master-table of a l l  the cases flagged by each 
p r e p o s i t i o n ,  then  for each verb, just t h e  i r regu lar i t i e s  are 
noted. 
(3) The  s c a n d a l  was whispered a b o u t  the room. 
Sentence (3)  i l l u s t r a t a s  thztt mabout" can f l a g  the p a t h  
case for a coaaunicat ion verb,  so ue do not w a n t  to rule out the 
p a t h  case: we just  want topic to be tried first. In (3) the 
topic  s l o t  v i l l  already be f i l l e d  by "the scandal*, so topic 
w i l l  be rejected, and the p a t h  case will be t r i d d  neyt. 
This faregrounding of cases is s p e c i f i e d  in t h e  d i c t i o n a r y .  
For instance, for the v e r b s  talk, laugh, w h l s ~ e r ,  etc., it is 
s p e c i f i e d  that t h e  occurrence of t h e  preposition "about" should  
trigger t h e  topic case before t h e  path  case, 
There is another obvious way of d e t e r m i n i n g  case naaes for 
prepositional and noun phrases. Copsider  t h e  sentences: 
(4) Fred bought t h e  car foe nary. 
( 5 )  Fred bought the car for one dollar. 
The p r e p o s i t i o n  *form f l a g s  many cases. In (4) it f laqs t h e  
bene f i c iary  case, and in (5) it f l a g s  the exchange case. 
~ssociated w i t h  each case is a test w h i c h  a phrase must pass to 
be accepted, In t h e  b e n e f i c i a r y  case the t es t  is: 
(BUST-BE ABIHATE), i n d i c a t i n g  t h a t  the benef ic iary  has to be 
anisate ,  whi le  the test for t h e  exchange case is: (HOT (SaoULD- 
BE HUIA11 ABSTBACT)) , i n d i c a t i n g  that one does n o t  u s u a l l y  
exchange something for a person or s o a e t h i n g  abstract .  These 
tests corre~tly sort o u t  the cases in sentences  (4) and (5). 
In general, tes ts  on cases are v e r y -  d i f f i c u l t  to d e s i g n  
adequately .  What t e s t  wonld be appropriate for the topic case? 
Uhat could n o t  be talked,  Laughed, or coied about? Perhaps some 
complex verb and context  dependent test co,uld be concocted, but 
one h a s  not been designed f o r  this system. The rest for the 
topic case is therefore ope which  w i l l  always pass.  O n e  m u s t  
therefore be careful when i n v o k i n g  t h e  top ic  case, 
The exchange case has s i m i l a t  p r o b l e q s ,  Anythinq can bla 
exchanged for s o n e t h i n g .  The weak test 
(NOT (SHOULD-BE H U M A N  A B S T R A C T ) )  
is p u t  in, which will at f i r s t  f a i l  if a human or an a b s t r a c t  
noun is t h e  c a n d i d a t e ,  but w i l l  pass  if n o t h i n g  else seems to 
fit either. T h i s  s i m p l e  test runs i n t o  problems with ce r t a in  
sentences,  
( 6 )  I p a i d  the money for ny mother's release. 
( 7 )  I paia  t h e  money for my nother. 
(8)  I p a i d  the money for the prostitute.  
It w i l l  i n i t i a l l y  force t h e  exchange case to reject " f o r  ~y 
mother's release" in ( 6 )  because it is abstract ,  but later on it 
w i l l  accept i t  s i n c e  all of the other cases f l a g g e d  by *for1@ 
will a l s o  reject it. Sentence  (7) is ambiguous, b u t  "mothern is 
a laos t  certainly in t h e  bene f i c iary  role here, so a g a i n  t h e  t e s t  
vorks correctly bp r e j e c t i n g  the exchange ease. Sentence (8) is 
a l s o  amhiguous, but our i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  would u s u a l l y  be that 
wprost i tutew i s  i n  the exchange case here. The sys tem w i l l ,  
however, ass ign  it the benef i c iary  case as it d i d  in (7). 
A d d i t i o n a l  work rust be done on case tests if t h i s  pacadign  is 
to be u s e f u l ,  
2.3 verb Specific Cases 
&any verbs h a v e  s p e c i a l  constructs or cases w h i c h  are not 
used with most other verbs. T h e s e  irregularities are h a n d l e d  b y  
w r i t i n g  special  f u n c t i o n s  to f i n d  t h e s e  cases. A few e x a a p l e s  
w i l l  ix lnstrate ,  
The verb "to hew has e i g h t  ~eanings in this s y s t e m .  The 
thira neaning is rto h a t e  t h e  property. . ", as i n  sentence [9), 
( 9 )  The house  i s  red. 
This meaning 1s the one b e i n g  used if an a d j e c t i v e  p h r a s e  
immediate ly  fo l lovs  t h e  verb .  An a d j e c t i v e  p h r a s e  i n  t h i s  
p o s i t i o n  i s  therefore a s p e c i a l  case of t h e  v e r b  "to bew, and 
there is a spec ia l  f u n c t i o n ,  ADJ-IIST,  v h i c h  Iooks for  i t .  
The s i x t h  meaning of "to bem is "to be fro. . . m., as  i n  
s e n t e n c e  (1  0) . 
(10) The l a d y  is from Onagadouqon. 
T h i s  c o u l d  be interpreted as an example of t h e  source case, 
which is the case that mfroam u s u a l l y  f l a g s ;  but what the 
sentence r e a l l y  means i s  that t h e  lady h a s  been l i v i n g  in 
Ouagadougou. T h i s  is, therefore, n o t  t h e  source case, b u t  
another s p e c i a l  case of n t o  hew. 
2-4 Verb D e f i n i t i o n s  
T h e  verb  is t r e a t e d  as t h e  foca l  p o i n t  of the s e n t e n c e ,  A 
verb can hare mil ln ip  rreanings, The system discovers which meaning 
i s  i n t e n d e d  by l o o k i n g  at t h e  rest  of t h e  sentence .  In so d o i n q ,  
it builds a structure r e p r e s e n t i n g  a parse o f .  t h e  s e n t e n c e ,  
As stated above, each verb has assoc ia ted  with it a case- 
frame, which is a set of cases of t h e  verb: some o b l i g a t o s g ,  
some o p t i a n a l ,  and sole  conditionally o p t i o n a l .  These cases are 
embedded In a form on tbe pxaperty list of the verb ,  Consider 
the verb "to order,* Its d i c t i o n a r y  e n t r y  i s  as follows:

Under the indicator V-!!EBB there is a form beginning 
(XP [ (AGBlJT . . IF is a f u n c t i o n  which takes  an even, b u t  
other~ i se  variable, nuaber of argaaents,  each pair  r e p r e s e n t i n q  
a meaning of the verb. The f i r s t  element of  each p a i r  is a s e t  
of cases to be l ooked  for,  and t h e  s e c o n d  is the s t r u c t u r e  to b e  
bailt if they are founa.  It i s  in the f i r s t  element of t h e  pair 
t h a t  t h e  complex i ty  l ies.  Let us look a t  i t  more closely. 
The list of cases i s .  in fact, a list of t r i p l e s .  The f i r s t  
elaaent of t h e  t r i p l e  is a fora to be EVALed. It is usually 
l o o k i n g  for a case. but any form is a d m i s s i b l e .  The s e c o n d  
e l e m e n t  of the t r i p l e  is an atom: a register  name. If t h e  f i r s t  
forn EVALs to a non-BIL v a l u e ,  the Value is p u t  into this 
register. In aur erample, for instance, the f i r s t  t r i p l e  is: 
(A ,GENT (MUST-BE EIUHAH)  ) AG (OPT (GETR PASSIVE) "SOBEONE) 
The f u n c t i o n  of the Zirst form is to find t h e  agent of the 
sentedce. If it succeeds, this agent is p u t  ineo register  AG. 
The third element of the tr ip le  i n d i c a t e s  what t o  do on 
fa i lure ,  If i t  is the atom "QBLA, t h i s  indicates t h a t  t h e  casa 
was ~bligatory; so if it was n o t  found, I P  s h o u l d  f a i l  on this 
meaning of the verb. If the atorn is "OPT", t h e n  the case is 
optional ,  t h e  register i s  l e f t  empty, and IF c o n t i n u e s  with t h i s  
meaning. The thira possibility is that this t h i r d  eleaent is a 
forn, in which case i t  is EVALed. If i t  r e t u r n s  mOBLw. or 9 0 P T m ,  
t h e n  t h e  result is as d e s c r i b e d  above. If it returns a n y t h i n g  
else, then that i s  put into the register, and IF c o n t i n u e s  w i t h  
t h i s  meaning of the v e r b ,  
The third e l e m e n t  of the first t r i p l e  for "to order" is 
COPT (GETB PASSIVE) 'SOHEOZOE). OPT is a v e r y  s i r a p l e  f u n c t i o n  
uh ich ,  if its f i r s t  arguaent is non-MIL, returns its second 
arguaent.  Otherwise it returhs "OBLn. (GETR PASSIVE) i s  true if 
the sentence  is in t h e  pass ive  voice. The f i r s t  t r i p l e  can be 
read as follows: 
Look for an agent w h i c h  l u s t  be human. If you f i n d  one, put 
it in register &G. Otherwise, if the sentence is p a s s i v e ,  nake 
SOLIEUHE the agent. O t h e r w i s e  f a i l .  
The second t r i p l e  is s i m p l e r .  It merely says: If you find 
an animate pa t i en t ,  t h e n  p u t  it i n  register PA, e l se  fail. 
The t h i r d  triple is e q u a l l y  s i m p l e :  it is n o t  looking f o r  a 
case, but a to-conplement.1 If t h e s e  three elements are f o u n d  in 
the sentence, then the spstea will look no further, b u t  assaae

contents of a register. IOUA-PUT returns t h e  structure of ths 
noun phrase associated with the noun in this register. The "?"

is fairly complex,  but basic all^ it looks for a component of the 
A T I  parse (in future  called the "p-parsev ,  f o r  part ia l -parse )  
which is in an appropriate p o s i t i o n  to be an a g e n t ,  and which

AGENT is opt ional  if the sentence is in the p a s s i v e  voice,  in 
which case p a t  S O l E O l E  in as the agent ;  otherwise AGENT is

IF t h e n  goes on to the next pair of arguments. This p a i r  is 
des igned to p i c k  up  t h e  meaning of PLAY as in n t o  p l a y  music-,g1 
Bote t h a t  the test on A G E H T  is just l i k e  the p r e v i o u s  one, vhich 
means f a i l u r e  here as well. The program moves on to the t h i r d

IF has completed its job. It has found what it t a k e s  to be 
the correct meaning of t h e  verb. Nou t h e  re- of t h e  sentence 
mast be processed .  The seconil e l e n e n t  of every t o p - l e v e l  list in 
t h e  p-parse is a flag v h i c h  is i n i t i a l l y  NIL, but w h i c h  is 
turned on when that part of t h e  s en tence  is c o n s i d e r e d  to b e  
correctly dealt with. In our example, so far o n l y  two parts are 
flagged: the f i r s t  noun phrase: "the %anw, and the verb phrase. 
The func t ion  which takes  care of the rest of t h e  sentence s i m p l y  
goes down the p-parse c h e c k i n g  these flags. If i t  finds one 
which is MIL it works on that p a r t  of t h e  sentence u n t i l  it 
either succeeds, or f a i l s  -- c a u s i n g  back-up. 
For t h i s  example, t h e n ,  t h e  f irst  p h r a s e  it comes upon 
needing work is the p r e p o s i t i o n a l  phrase:  " b e s i d e  the window". 
As rent ioned above .  there is a r a s t e r - t a b l e  in the s y s t e n  v h i c h  
aBS0Ciates each p r e p o s i t i o n  wi th  t h e  cases it Bay  f l a g .  BESIDE 
f l a g s  the cases: LOCATIOI  and DESCRIPTIVE.  A 1 1  of t h e  cases but 
DESCRIPTXVE are  cases of t h e  verb.  DESCRIPTIVE i s  a s p e c i a l  case 
v h i c h  is used for preposition phrases which modi fy  noons. 
When the list of cases associated with a p r e p o s i t i o n  is 
retrieved, there is a q u e s t i o n  as to u h i c h  case to try first. 
For this there is a foregrounding rout ine ,  w i t h  several  cr i t er ia  
for f oregrounding  : 
First of a l l ,  i n  the d i c t i o n a r y  d e f i n i t i o n  of t h e  verb, t h e  
user may s p e c i f y  that a certa in  prepos i t ion  trigger a part icular  
case program. S i n c e  there i s  n o  such  s p e c i f i c a t i o n  for "to play" 
in the current dictionary, nothing hap pens here, S e c o n d l y ,  on 
the property  list of each verb  is k e p t  a record of uhich 
prepos i t i ons  flagged v h i c h  cases in the previous sentehces. The 
cases associated with the p r e p o s i t i o n  i n  q u e s t i o n  (if there are 
any) are f o r e g t o u n d e d ,  so that they u i l l  be tried f irst  (the 
mst recent case f irs t ,  etc.) P i n a l l y ,  if DESCRIPTIVE is one of 
the cases in the list of cases for this preposition, and if a 
noun phrase  or a prepos i t i ona l  phrase immediately'  precedes the 
Jf 
phrase in q u e s t i o n ,  and if the noun in that noun phrase or 
prepos i t i ona l  phrase i s  n o t  a proper noun, then DESCRIPTIVE is 
p u t  at the front of the list, and is t h u s  tried first. 
This s e e m i n g l y  obscar~ rule for foregrounding the 
DESCRIPTIVE case is just a h e u r i s t i c .  If the t e s t s  assoc iated  
w i t h  each case are good enough, it makes nb difference to the 
f i n a l  outcome iE the foregrounding is done or not. In some 
instances ,  houever, if the DESCRIPTIVE case is not  tried first ,  
it w i l l  never be t r i e d .  In our e x a ~ p l e ,  for instance, it is t h e  
man who is bes ide  the vindow ( D E S C R I P T I V E  case) ; he d i d  n o t  play 
t h e  piano beside the window (LOCAT'ION case). But it is perfectlp' 
f e a s i b l e  for him to have p l a y e d  it beside the, window (if we know 
nothing about the l o c a t i o n  of the piaao.) Therefore either of 
t h e  cases will succeed. It is only the position of the 
p r e p o s i t i o n a l  phrase t h a t  i n d i c a t e s  which case is correct. 
Continuing with our exaaple: the DESCRIPTIVE case is 
foregrounded. and so t h e  d e s c r i p t i v e  case f u n c t i o n ,  DESC, is 
i n v o k e d  wi th  the - phrase  " b e s i d e  t h e  windova as its argument. 
S i n c e  the d e s c r i p t i v e  case almost a l w a y s  i n v o l v e s  a

"beside the viado@. is a p o s s i b l e  descriptor of "the man. 
Since we do not have a data  base to check to see if there 
is a man besiae a window, our check must be a general  one. Host 
nouns have a size associated with them under the i n d i c a t o r  
OBJ-SIZE, T h i s  is a very  crude  breakdown of p h y s i c a l  objects

probably  not the sane size as an e l e p h a n t .  T h i s  feature is 
c u r r e n t l y  not implemented.)  The c h e c k  for  "bes ide"  is merely

abstract nouns have no size inforaat ion,  sentences l i k e  "Be had

A forn is s t a c k e d  which will p u t  t h i s  s tructure  into the

The anaphoric part of t h e  s y s t e m  has not been e x p l a i n e d

reason can be r u l e d  out. In order to ueaken the t e s t s ,  a flag is 
set to shut off  t h e  SHOULD-BE tests ,  That is, all S H O U L D - B E

5. 4gaphoric References 
Anaphoric references are r e s o l v e d  in t h e  case analysis p a r t  
of the systea. As the s y s t e m  is developed around a spec i f ic  
aomain or data base, these routines w i l l  be modi f i ed  to g i v e  
them .ore power. C u r r e n t l y  t h e y  work solely by l o o k i n g  at the 
p r e v i o u s  sentences. 
R e s o l u t i o n  of anaphoric references fits very  well i n t o  a 
case sys tem.  S i n c e  a pronoan is o n l y  eacountered in a search  for 
a particular case, this gives t h e  anaphoric  rout ines  a grea t  
deal of in fornat ion  about what kind of referent to look for, 
Here we w i l l  give j u s t  a b r i e f  o u t l i n e  of a f a i r l y  i n t r i c a t e  
pr ocedare, 
When a pronoun is found in the s e n t e n c e ,  it triggers a c a l l  
to t h e  f u n c t i o n  AI1PBOBfC.  ABAPHORIC t a k e s  four arguments: 
1, A list of cases to l o o k  for, 
2,2 A t e s t  t h a t  the referent must pass,  
3. B number i n d i c a t i n g  hov f a r  back in t h e  h i s t o r y  to 
look, 
Q. The pronoun referenced, 
The search is breadth f irs t ,  in t h a t  t h e  program tries v e r y  hard  
to f i n d  t h e  referent in the earliest  p o s s i b l e  sentence.  Fhe t e s t  
i s  an arbitrary fosm. SBOULD-BE and RUST-BE e l e m e n t s  of the test 
are s h u t  off on failure as t h e y  are in t h e  r e s t  of the back-up 
procedure. 
Say, for instance, that the system is g i v e n  t h e  s entence :  
(12) He p l a y e d  the piano, 
The ca l l  to AGENT uould be the form: 
( A G E N T  (&HD (SHOULD-BE IlUSLCIAN) (BUST-BE HUHAN) ) ) . S i n c e  t h e  
o b v i o u s  candidate for the a g e n t  is a pronoon, A H A P H O R I C  uou ld  be 
invoked ,  I t s  TEST would be: 
( A I D  (SHOULD-BE B U S L C I A N )  (RUST-BE H U H A H )  1 1 ,  
ANAPHOBIC would look back through the parses and p-parses of t h e  
recent s e n t e n c e s  which are k e p t  as global v a r i a b l e s ,  l d o k i n g  for 
a noan phrase that a i l 1  pass this test, As it becomes ao te  and 
r e  d e s p e r a t e  it w i l l  make the  test less strict .  S i n c e  %eta is 
the  pronoun, A B A P E O R I C  is smart enough to i n s i s t  that the 
referent be male. 
Host pronoun references wi th in  a s e n t e n c e  itself can a l s o  
be resolved. For instance: 
( $ 3 )  _I_C_ Fred went to London so he c o u l d  visit the queen. 
(14 )  - Ja& took you up in airplane.  
Beferences to events ana places can also be handled: 
(15) It was anfostonate that the children were k i l l e d -  
[ 161 I went to Prance. F t e t l  lives there. 
The resolution of locat ional references ("herea and thereu) is 
a d i f f i c u l t  proble.. 811 treat ing  stherern as a pronoun whose 
referent aast be a location, Wtherew I s  h a n d l e d  f a i r l y  well by 
the system, 'Here" is mach more d i f f i c u l t ,  since its resolution 
is h i g h l y  context dependent.  
another dPff  icult problea is i l l u s t r a t e d  by sentence (17) , 
(I?) Harp. was aboard the Titanic when she sank .  
Phis sentence is aabigooas: Mary c o u l d  hare sunk in a s v i a m i n q  
pool while she was on the ~itanic, bat this i s  probably not  the 
intanlied meaning. If w t o  s i n k "  i s  d e f i n e d  w i t h  a tes t  like 
(SHOULD-BE BOAT) 
m rfU pick up " T i t a n i c n  correctly. Its f i r s t  
u tZmiUdate is *larym, however; t h u s  if t h e  t e s t  does 
ra out, t h e  qsteim w i l l  choose her as its i n i t i a l  
Qm-fi;S~ 
This i l l n s t r a t e s  a d i f f i c u l t y  with t h e  current system's 
anaphoric routines, The f i r s t  candidate f o u n d  which passes the 
test is chosen ,  rather than  all of the c a n d i d a t e s  b e i n g  looked 
at, and the most l i k e l y  accepted,  
In s n ~ m a r y ,  then, what we have i m p l e m e n t e d  i s  a p o w e r f u l  
parser for Engl i sh  sentences .  It e a p l o y s  case frames to di score2  
the i n t e n d e d  meaning of the verb,  then cont inues  to use case in 
its a n a l y s i s  of the rest of the sentence. Each case has one ofr 
more tests associated with it, and each v e r b  can add f u r t h e r  
tests to the cases in its case frames. T h e s e  t e s t s  are g r a d u a l l y  
veakened on fa i lure ,  giving the careful  user complete c o n t r o l  
over t h e  back-up. 
The system is carefully s t r u c t u r e d  to allow easy e x t e n s i o n  
or aod i f i ca t ion .  As more wor ld  knowledge is added to t h e  systen ,  
t h e  tests on th& cases, and in the case frames can b e  made to 
e n p l o y  this knowledge, thus naking them aore selective.  
The s tructure  b u i l d i n g  routines are c o a p l e t e l y  g e n e r a l ,  
allowing t h e  user  to retarn any strncture he desires  within the 
constzaints of the general knowledge he puts i n t o  the systea.
