Tree Ad j~g Grammars, or "TAG's', (Josh/, Levy & 
Takahash/ 1975; Josh/ 1983; Kroch & Josh/ 1965) we~

formalisms that are ,,_~'~ in theoretical ~,.ll,/~s of languaSe.

"\['n/s paper ___~,~,ibcs how we have applied the theory of 
Tree Adjoining Grammars to natural language generation. 
We have ~ attracted to TAG's because their cemral 
opemtiou--~he exteamou of an "initial" phra~ m~ca~u tree 
through the incl~/ou, at re,? , ~ y  came~/aed 
loeatinus, of oae or mmu "au~!!iar~'* ~ d s

p~rfonnnce-one~ted theory. 
We besm by briefly _,~,,-,ibin 8 TAG's u ? formalism 
for phrase ram:rare in a com~___~ theory, and summar/ze 
the points in the theory of TAG's that are germainu to our 
own theory. We them conmdm' generaUy the poation of a 
grammar within the geueratiem process, inemducmg our use 
of TAG's through a contrast with how oth~nJ have used 
system~ grammars. This takes us to the ,~,~,~ resulm of 
our psper:, usng eaamp/es from our research with 
wefl.wrR1eu trots from aewupapmm, we walk throush our 
TAG insp/~ed treatments cl r~ng and wh-movemem, and 
show the cc~denc~ of the TAG ~adjunct/oo" oper~t/oa 
and our "attachment" process. 
In the final tectiou we discuss ~mau/ons to the theory, 
motivated by the way we usa the operafiou cmveqxmdin 8 
to TAG's" adjun~iou in performance. This mssesss that the 
compe~eace theory of TAG's  can be profitably projoc~ed to 
s~na:tur~ at the morphoiogicaJ leve/ as weft as the preseat 
syntacuc level 
2. Tree Ad\]unctioo Grammars 
The theoretic~ apparatus of a TAG cons/sin of a 
primitive~ defined set of "elememary" phrase smgnu~ 
gge~ a Jqinkins'~ l'~lgJOgl thag ~ ~ ~ to de~e 
dependency relations between two nodes within an 
elemeutary tree, and an "adjunction" operarlon that 
combines trees under specifiable constraints. The elementary 
frees are divided into gwo sets: initLll and auxiliary. Initial 
wea have only terminals at their leaves. A~///m.y we~ are 
distinguished by having role non-terminal among their 
leaves; the category of th/s node must be the same u the 
,~tegol~ of the root. AU c /~ l  ~1 ~ ~ "~nnlnlmaJ n ill 
the serum that they do am regunm on any nou-~rminal. 
A mxle NI  in an elementa,lry tree may be linked 
(co-indaad) to a second aode N2 in the same tree 
provided NI c-commands N2. ~Jnklng is used to indicate 
grammadcaUy defined del~de~:/es between nodes ~.b  u 
subcatesorizatiou relatioashipe or fdler-sap dependencies. 
Links are p~ved (thouSh "m~.bed out") when their txee 
is extended throu~ adjunctioo; this is the mechan/sm 
TAG's use to re~re~___ t unbounded del~denczes. 
Seatea?u der/va0om start with an in/tial uee, and 
contimm via the adjunctim of an arbitrary number of 
auxiJumj trees. To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with reo? 
,-~tegory X to a in/t/a/ (or c lenv~) tree T, we first se/ecz 
some node of catesory X within T to be the point at 
which the adjunction is to occur. Then (1) the subcree of 
T dominated by that instance of X (carl it X') is removed 
from T, (2) the au.vili~ry ~ A is kn/t into T at the 
pos/tioQ where X" had beret Icelted, and (3) die sublree 
detainer_..4 by X" is kn/t into A to replace the second 
cgcurencu of the catego~ X at T's frontier. The two trees 
have now been merged by "up/icing" A into T, disp/acing 
the subcrea of T at the pmnt of the adjunction to the 
fromier of A. 
For ~-ram~e we cmdd take the initial tree: 
~. who~ doa ~ Zohn ~ke "i \] l 
(the subucnlX "i" indJ~ttes that the "who" and the trace "e" 
am Unked) and adjoin to it the aux/Uar/ Uree: 
to pTedum the derived trea: 
94 
Adjunctioe may be "constrained'. The grammar writer 
may specify which specific trees may be adjoined to a given 
node in an elementary tree; if no specification is given the 
default is that there is no constraint and that any auxiliary 
tree may be adjoined to the node. 
2.1 Key f,_,_m~ of the theory of TAG's 
A TAG tqxectfi~ mrfaee m'ucture. There is no notion 
of derivation from deep structure in the theory of 
TAG's- - the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwise 
changed once they are introduced into a text, only 
combined with other primitive trees. As Kmch and Jmhi 
point out, this means that a TAG is incomplete ms an 
account of the structure of a natural language, e.g. a TAG 
grammar wW contain ~th  an active and a passive form of 
the same verbal sutx:ategurization pattern, without an 
theory-mediated escription of the very clme relationship 
between them. 
To our minds this is by uo means a deficit. The 
p~c~lural  machinery that generative grammars have 
traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like 
that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of 
employing tho~ characterizations in processing models of 
generation. This is because a generation model, like any 
theory of performance, has a procedural m'ucture of its 
own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at least 
not while still operating efficiently or while retainin 5 a 
simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual 
machine that its authors put forward ms their ao~unt  of 
psycholinguistic data. 
Our own generator uses surface structure ms its only 
expficifly represented linguistic level. Thus grammatical 
formalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface form 
are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a 
deep to surface transformational process. 
A TAG Involves the manlpulatlea of very mmail 
demantary m'uctures. This is _'~'__~_use of the stipulation 
that elementary trees may not include recumve nodes. It 
implies that the sentences one ~ in everyday usage, e.g. 
aewpaper texts, are the result of many _o_,__e~6_ 're adjunctions. 
This melds nicely with a move that we have made in 
recent years to view the conceptual representation from 
which generation proceeds ms consisting of a heap of very 
small, redundantly related information units that have been 
defiberately selected by a text plannin~g ~ from the 
total state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance; 
each such unit will correspond in the final te~ to a head 
lexical item plus selected thematic arguments--a linguistic 
entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a 
TAG. 
TAG U~n7 Indudes ~ ly  ow operm~oa, mqemetlom, 
and otherwim . - -~- ,  u .4, . , , .~ to the elemantary trees 
that go tn ts ?  text. This compom well with the indefibllity 
mpulatiou in our mode/ of gene~uion, tince adected text 
fragments ~ be ~ d i~y all ~ by th@ gl~mm~r 
without the need for any later transformation. The 
composition options delimited by the constraints on 
adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative 
text forms which can correspond directly in generation to 
alternative conceptual relations among information units, 
alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in t,,~me 
style. 
3. Adapt ing  TAG's  to  Generat ion  
The mapping from TAG's  as a formaligm for 
competence theories of language to our formalism for 
generation is strikingly direct. As we described in Section 5 
their adjunction operation corresponds to our attachment 
Wcgess; their constraints ou adjunction correspond to our 
attachment points; their surface structure trees correspoad to 
our surface structure trees, t We further hypothesize that 
two quite strong correspondence claims can be made, 
though considerably more experimentation and theorizing 
will have to be done with both formalisms before these 
claims can be c~nfirmed. 
I. The primitive information units in renlization 
specifications can be realized exclusively ms one or 
another elementary tree ms def'med by a suitable 
TAG, i.e. linguistic criteria can be used in 
derermmmg the proper modularity of the 
conceptual structure. 2 
2. Convex~ly, for any textual relationship which our 
generator would derive by the attachment of 
multiple information units into a ~ingle package, 
there is a correslxmding rule of adjunct/on. Since 
we u~ attachment in the rp,~li,~tiou of nominal 
compounds like "o// tanker', this has the force of 
extending the domain of TAG analyses into 
morphology. (See section 7).

To understand why we are looking at TAG's  rather 
than some other formaJi~n, one must first understand the 
role of grammar within our ~ g  model. The foflowing

We have always had two complementa~ goats in our 
research: on the one hand our generation program hu  had 
to be of practical utility to the Imowedge based expert 
systems that use it as part of a natural language interface. 
This means that architecturally our generator has always 
dmgned to produce text from mecepmal 
spm:~catlons, "plans", devdo~ by another program and 
comequenfly has had to be mmt ive  to the limitations and 
v-ap~g approaches of the present state of the art in 
concepmal reprewntation. 
At  the same time, we want the architecture of the 
vimud m~hlne  that we abstract out of our program to be 
effective as a murce of psycholinguis~c hypothesm about 
the actual generation p~c~em that humans use; it should, 
for example, provide the basis for predictive ___~mts of 
human speech error behavior and apparent p~annin s 
l imitatioB. To achieve this, we have restricted om~lves to 
a highly constrained set of representations and operations, 
?nd have adopced strong and mgge~ve stipulations on our 
dmigu such as high locality, information encaptmlation, 
online qua~-realtimo rtlotime performan~, and inclelibility. 3 
restricts us u ptogrammm, but disaplines us as 
theomu.  
We me the pmce~ of generation u involving tluen 
temporally intmmingied activities: (1) determinin$ what goats 
the u~(~ is tO ac.hie~e, (2) plxnnin S what informaboll 
omtent  and rhetorical force will best meet those goals given 
the context, and (3) realizing the tpectfied inlormation and 
rhetorical intent as a grammatical teat. Our l /agum~ 
camom,~ (henceforth LC), the Zetalisp ~ MUMBLE, 
handles the ~ of these activities, tskin\]g a "TMal~tiO~

As described in \[McDonald 19@t\], LC is a 
" ~ o n ~ e d "  process: it ~ the m-~nue of the 
realization specification it is given, plus the syntactic surfa~ 
ttrueture of the text in progrem (which it extends 
incrementally as the qxa:?fication is mafized) to directly 
control its sctions, in t~t ,~hag them as though they were 
sequential computer programs. This technique imposes

4.1 Unlmmclll~ Syaemb: Gramman 
Of the established linguistic formalims, systemic 
grammar \[Halliday 1976\] has always been the most 
important to AI researchers on generation. Two of the 
mo~ important generation systems that have been 
deveJoped, PROTEUS ~Davey 1974\] and NIGEL \[Mann & 
Manhie~en 1983\], am systemic grammar, and others, 
including ourselves, have been mongly influenced by it. 
The reasons for this entb,,tlatm are central to the special 
concerns of generation. Systemic grammars employ a 
functional vocabulary: they empha~/ze the uses to which 
language can be put--how languages achieve their speakers" 
goaLs-rather than its formal structure. Since the generation 
pmcem begins with goals, unlike the comprehension process 
which begins with structure, this orientation makes systemic 
grammars more immediately useful than, for example, 
tramffotmationai generatb,+ grammars or even procedurally 
oriented AI fogmali-qa~s |of language such as ATN's. 
The generation researcher's primary question is why use 
one construction rather than another--active instead of 
pa~ive, "the" instead of "a'. "toe principle device of a 
systemic grammar, the "choice system", mppom this 
question by highlighting how the constructions of the 
language are gmupud into met of a l temativet Choice 
systems pro~tde an anchoring point for the rules of a 
theory of language u~ tin,-,, it it natural to associate the 
vaziotm romantic, d i sgou~,  or rhetorical criteria that bear 
oa the mlection of a given ~ o n  or feature with the 
choice system to which the consmmtion belongs, thus 
providing the basis of a decision-Wm:edure for rejecting 
from its Listed atternatives; the NIGEL sy~em does ~ y  
this in its "chooser" p~c~_~M_ures. 
In our formal ism ~ make tt~e o~ ttu~ saint i~l'ormatWn 
a.? a sy~emic grammar captures, however we have choosen to 
bundle it quite di f feremly.  The  maderlyiog reat~ for this is 
that our concern for p~/cholinguistic modeling and efficient 
procemin~ takes ~ c e  in our design decisions about 
how the facts of language and language me should be 
repretented in a generator. It is thus instructive to look at 
the different kinds of linguistic information that a network 
of choice systems carry. In our system we distribute the~,-- 
to separate computational devimm. 
o Delx~cl?ncies among smmtutal features: A generator 
must respect the constraints that dependencies impom 
and appgeciam ,.he impact they have on its 
reafization options: for example that tome 
mburdinate da-,~_ can am express ten~ or modality 
while main datum are required to; or that a 
j~ in l l  ~ Ob~Ol~ foN pll~de ~ e n t  
while a lealcal ob~cts leaves it optiomd. 
96  
o Usage criteria. The deei_'Moa pr~___~_mms associated 
with each choice system are not a part of the 
oammsLr pl~ m, althOUgh thfy ~ natllg~y 
asaociated with it and organized by it. Also most 
s~lra~\[lic glr'amm~ll include V~'y a ~  f~tuns  ~teh 
as "geneS: reference" or "completed action', which 
~e la te  the language's surface fennues, and 
thus are more controllert of why a construct is -_~_ 
rather than consmJcu themsetva. 
o Coordinated mucunal  alternative=. A teutence may 
be either active or passive, either a question or a 
statement. By grouping these Mternatives into 
systems and using the:m systems exclusively when 
constructing a teat, one is guaranteed not to 
~bine  inconsistent ttruetural featun=. 
o Efficieat ordering of choice~ The network that 
a~mects choice systems p~ovides a aamral path 
betweeu decision, which if followed strictly 
guarentees that a choice will not be made unlem it 
is required, and that it will aot be made before any 
of the choices that it is it~If dependent upon, 
insuring that it can be made indelibly. 
o Typology of surface structure. Almost by accident 
(since its specification is distributed throughout all of 
the systems implicidy), the stammer determines the 
pattern of dominance and cmtstituency relatiomhips 
of the ta t .  While not a principle of the theory, 
the trees of dauscs, NPs, etc, in ty~.emi? grammars 
tend to be thallow and broad. 
We believe, but have no? yet established, that 
equivalence transformations can be defined that would take 
a systemic grammar as a tpecification to coummct the 
alternative devices that we use in our generator (or 
augment devices that derive from other murcm, e.g. a 
TAG)  by 4_-eom_ Ixxing the in/ormation in the sy~emic 
grammar aloug the lines just U_~__*~_ and redistributing it. 
s. Fuam#e Anat~ 
One of the task domaiM we are c~,i,~.tly developing 
involves newsl~per reports of current events. We are 
"revere engh~eering" leading paragraphs from actual 
eewsptper articles to produce ~ but mmpta  
conceptual repretmttation, and then designing realization 
tpecificatiomt.-plam--that will lead our LC  to recommtet 
the ori~nal text or mmivated variatiou on it. We have 
adolxed this domain because the ae~a mporung task, with 
its requirement of communicating what is new and 
tignificant in an event as well as the event itmif, appears 
to impom e=czptioually rich cooaerainm on the udection of 
what conceptual informatioo to report and on what 
syntaeth: omummctiom to u.~ in reporting it (see 
in Clipplnger & McDmald \[1983|. We expect to f'md out 
how much mmplt=tity a realizatioa q~cification requires in 
order to motivate such carefully mmpmed texts; this will 
later guide ,,I, in dmin l -  s a tat I ~  with ~ t  
capsbilitim to mmtruct ugh wecificatiom on its o~m. 
Our examples are drawn from the text fragment below 
(Associated Press, 12/23/84); the realization specification we 
use to reproduce the ta t  foUow~.

(pareetm~ # ~  Ttumtuvm Osto-ofltc~a>

This realization specification represents the structured 
object which gives the toplevel plan for this utterance. 
Symbols preceded by colons indicate particular featur~ of 
the utterance. The two ex~ont  in parenthems rare the 
content items of the specification and axe resmeted to 
appear in the utterance in that order. The first symbol in 
,.~eh_ expression is a labet indicating the function of that 
item within the plan; embett,bM__ items appearing in angle 
brackets ere in/ormatiou units from the current-events 
knowledge base. 
Obviously this plan must be considerably refined before 
it could mrve as a proximal toarce for the text; that is 
why we point out that it is a "toplevel" plan. It is a 
specification for the general outline of the utterance which 
mum l~ flC~lhed out by rtgugsive planning OUce its 
realization has begun and the LC can mpply a linguistic 
context to further constrain the choices for the units and 
the rhetorical fcatunm. 
For present purposes, the key fact to a l~re  about 
this realization specification is how different it is in form 
from the surface structure. One cannot produce the -ited 
text simply by travemng and "reading oat" the dements of 
the specification as though one were de~g 
production. S ~  rearrangements are required, and 
these must be done under the coutrol of constraints which 
can only be stated in linguis~ vocabulary with terms like 
"subject" or "r~i~in$'. 
The fire unit in the qxcification, #<satin.civet.type..>, 
is a relation over two other units. It indicates that a 
commotmiity between the two has been noticed and deemed 
significam in the underlying representation of the event. 
The premat LC always realize, such relatious by merging 
the realizations of the two units. If nothing else occurred, 
this would give us the ta t  "Two od tanker, were ~ by 
mits/~r". 
97 
As it happens, however, a penclmg rhetorical constra/nt 
from the rcef i~t ion specification, 
~v 8wto-sotm~ 
will force the addition of yet another information unit, 6 the 
reporting event by the ~ service that announced the 
a/edged event (e.g. a press relce.~ from Iraq, Reuters, etc.). 
In this case the "content" of the ~ event is the two 
which have already been p/armed for 
inclusion in the utterance as past of the "particulars" part 
of the specification. L~ us look closely at how that 
reportiing event unit is folded into turface mmcture. 
When am itself the focus of attention, a 
event is typically realized u "so-and-,m said X' ,  that is, the 
content of the report is more important than the report 
itsel/; whatever sigmficance the report or its source has as 
newu will be indicated subtlly through which of the 
alternative realizations below is selected for it. 7

In our LC, the-,, alternative "choices" are grouped 
together into a "rcefization class" as shown in Figure 3. 
Our reatization cla.~,~s have their historic or/sire in the 
choice systems of systemic grammar, though they are very 
dLfferent in almost every concrete detail. The mot  
important difference of interest theoretically is that while 
systemic choice systems select among s/ogle alternative 
features (e.g. passive, gemndive), realization classes select 
among entire surface smmture fragments at a tune (which 
might be seen as ~ e d  ~t ious  of bundles of 
features). That  is, our approach to genmt~on cafls for us 
to organize our docis/on procedures m as to ,elect the 
values for a number of linguistic feature5 timultaneouMy in 
one choice where a system~ grnmmar would make the 
selection incrementally. 8

Returning to our example, we are now faced now with 
the need to incorporate a unit denoting the report of the 
Iraqi attacks into the utterance to act as a certification of 
the #<:~t~> events. This will be done using the 
reafization class tx~eve-veres; the cla~ is applicable to any 
information un;t of the form rel~rt(surce, into) (and 
others). It determines the reafizat/on of such units bot h 
when they appear in is~olation and, as in the present case, 
when they are to augment an utterance corresponding to 
one of th~z arguments. 
From this realization class the choice 
rag~VERB-~to-Pl~OP will be selected s/nce (1) the fact that 
two shipu were hit is most s/gnificant, meaning that the 
focus wil l  be on the information and not the source (n.b. 
when the dam executes the murc~ ~ will be bound to its 
parameter and the information about the missile hits to the 
propcat ion parameter); (2) there is no rhetorical motivation 
for us to occupy space in the first sentence with the 
murca  of the report s/rice they have already been planned 
to follow. These conditions are sensed by attached 
pr~__~urm associated with the characteristics that annotate 
the choice (i.e. f~us and mum~oncd.e.b~whe~e).

As reader8 of any of our eari/er paper~ are aware, we 
do am employ a coaveatiomd tree notation in our LC. A 
generation model places its own kinds of demaads oa the 
representation of surface structure, and them lead to 
~i-dpled ~ from me conventions adop~ by 
theoretical tlngnim. Figure 6 shows \[he uuface m'ucuue as

We call this repres~tation pmh no?cufo~ because it 
defines the path that our LC. Formally the muctum is 
am a tree but a unidirectional Ih~ked list whose formadoa 
rules obey the axioms of a tree (e.g. any path "down" 
through a given node must eventuaUy pass back "up" 
mrough that same node). The path co~ of a s~ream of 
entiu~s representing phrasal nodes, constituent positions 
(indicated by square brack~s), insumces of information units 
(in boldface), inaanca  of words, and activated attachment 
pomu (me labeled circle und~ me ;nedicate; me next 
u;etion). The various symbols in the figure (e.g. mmmce,  
pred/ram, etc.) have attached procedures that are activated 
as the point of speech morea a/on s the path, a process w? 
call q~hram muczure ctecution". Phra~ mueture ctecution 
is the means by wh/eh grammat/cel consta-aints are impmecl 
oa embedded ecim'oas and function words and grammatical 
moq3he~es are produced (~or discuss/on tee McDoo~d

The TAG formalism allowu a grammar writer to define 
"a~straints" by annotating the nodes of elememary 
with lists indicstin8 what auxiliary trees may be ?djohmd to 
them (inducling "any" or "non~'). m In a ~ manner 
the "choices" in our realization dasms--which by our 
hypothem can be taken to always corrmpm~ to TAG 
elemeautry urees--iadude specifications of the a~ta~Asumt 
po~r~ at which new information unto can be 
iato the ms, face muctum peth they define. Rather than 
being c~nsl~aints on an othexwise free~ applying uperathxt, 
as in a TAG, attachment pohtts age actual objects 
i n te~ in the path noutdon of the surface sm~mm. A 
list of the attachment points acbve at any momunt is 
mainta/ned by the attachment process and ~adted  
whenever an information unit needs to be .,~4_o Mint 
un/ts could be attached at any of mveral points, with the 
decis/on being made on the basis of what would be most 
consistunt with the des/red prow style (of. McOoemid 
Pustejowky \[198~a\]). Whea one of the poinu is sdecud it is 
ins?anti?ted, usually spficin 8 in new surface m'ucture in the 
protein, and the new unit -~d_-~_ at a dmignated ptmtion 
with/n the new structure. Figure 7 shows our Wemnt 
definition of the attachment point that ultima~dy leads to 
the addition of "w~s reported".

From this discussion one can tee that our urea?taunt of 
art ? th in ?at  usa  two tt~tctuges, an attachment point and ? 
choice, where ? TAG would oedy use cme structure, an 
anx/lia~ tree. Tim is ? amsequeace of the fact that we 
are working with a performance medel of generation that 
m,,~ ,how explicitly how coacupm~ in/ormafion units arts 
rendered into tea?as as part of ? IxJychofinguisticafly plaus/ble 
process, while ? TAG is ? formaIiun for competence 
theories that oily aeed to qxcify the syntactic mnu~:mm of
the grammatical minp  of a languagu. "Vnis is a usnifa:ant 
cliff?race, but not one that should stand in our way in 
compming what the two theories have to offer each other.

6. Generat ing  quest ions us ing a TAG vernon  og 
wh-movement  
Earlier we illustrated the TAG mncept of "\]inking" by 
shemdng how one woukl ,ran ~th  -,', initial u'ee consisting 
of the /nmrrmo~ datum of a quest/on p/us the frooted 
wh-phnum and then build outward by ma:emvely ?die/n/rig 
the des/red amdtiary phrases to the S node that intervenes 
baweea the wb-phram and the dame. Wh-quest/ons am 
thus built from the bottom up, as in fact is any sentence 
involving wa~ tsklng urn?retrial complements. 
This an?lyre has the dem~ble property of ?flowing mus 
to state the dependencies between the W~3hrase aad the 
gap as a laced relation on a =ngie elementary tree, 
criminating the need to inducie any machinery for 
movemem iu the theory. Aft unbounded ependencies now 
derive from adjunczioas (which, as far as the grammar is 
coucerned, ca? be made withemt limit), rather than m the 
ex i t  migratkm of a c~mdtount 8cram dauses. 
We also find this iocaiRy property to be demable, aad
