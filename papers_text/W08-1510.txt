Abstract  
S-MINDS is a speech translation system, 
which allows an English speaker to commu-
nicate with a limited English proficiency 
speaker easily within a question-and-answer, 
interview-style format. It can handle dialogs 
in specific settings such as nurse-patient in-
teraction, or medical triage.  We have built 
and tested an English-Spanish system for ena-
bling nurse-patient interaction in a number of 
domains in Kaiser Permanente achieving a to-
tal translation accuracy of 92.8% (for both 
English and Spanish).  We will give an over-
view of the system as well as the quantitative 
and qualitatively system performance. 
1 Introduction 
There has been a lot of work in the area of 
speech to speech translation by CMU, IBM, SRI, 
University of Geneva and others. In a health care 
setting, this technology has the potential to give 
nurses and other clinical staff immediate access 
to consistent, easy-to-use, and accurate medical 
interpretation for routine patient encounters. This 
could greatly improve safety and quality of care 
for patients who speak a different language from 
that of the healthcare provider. 
This paper describes the building and testing of a 
speech translation system, S-MINDS (Speaking 
Multilingual Interactive Natural Dialog System), 
built in less than 3 months with Kaiser Perma-
nente Hospital in San Francisco, CA.  The sys-
tem was able to gain fairly robust results for the 
domains that it was designed for, and we believe

that it does demonstrate that building and deploy-
ing a successful speech translation system is be-
coming possible and even commercially viable. 
 
2 Background 
The number of people in the U.S. who speak a 
language other than English is large and grow-
ing, and Spanish is the most commonly spoken 
language next to English. According to the 2000 
census, 18% of the U.S. population over age 5 
(47 million people) did not speak English at 
home?a 48% increase from 1990. In 2000, 8% 
of the population (21 million) was LEP (Limited 
English Proficiency), with more than 65% of that 
population (almost 14 million people) speaking 
Spanish. 
A body of research shows that language barriers 
impede access to care, compromise quality, and 
increase the risk of adverse outcomes. Although 
trained medical interpreters and bilingual health-
care providers are effective in overcoming such 
language barriers, the use of semi-fluent health-
care professionals and ad hoc interpreters (such 
as family members and friends) cause more in-
terpreter errors and lower quality of care (Flores 
2005).  
When friends and family interpret, they are prone 
to omit, add, and substitute information. Often 
they inject their own opinions and observations, 
or impose their own values and judgments, rather 
than interpreting what the patient actually said. 
Frequently these ad hoc interpreters have limited 
English capabilities themselves and are 
unfamiliar with medical terminology. 
Furthermore, many patients are reluctant to 
disclose private or sensitive information in front 
of a family member, thus giving the doctor an 
incomplete picture; this sometimes prevents a 
54
correct diagnosis. For example, a battered 
woman is unlikely to reveal the true cause of her 
injuries if her husband is being used as the 
interpreter. 
The California Academy of Family Physicians 
Foundation conducted practice visits in 2006 and 
found that, ?Although they realize the use of 
family members or friends as interpreters is 
probably not the best means of interpretation, all 
practice teams use them.? (Chen et al2007) 
3 System Description 
Fluential?s speech translation system, S-
MINDS1, has a hybrid architecture (Figure 1) 
that combines multiple ASR engines and multi-
ple translation engines. This approach only 
slightly increases the development cost of new 
translation applications, but it greatly improves 
the accuracy and the coverage of the system by 
leveraging the strengths of both statistical and 
grammar/rules-based systems. Furthermore, this 
hybrid approach enables rapid integration of new 
speech recognition and translation engines as 
they become available. 
 
 
Figure 1. The hybrid system architecture of S-
MINDS combines multiple ASR engines with an in-
terpretation engine and an SMT engine. Note that this 
figure describes the interaction in English to-second 
language direction only. The 2nd language-to-English 
direction has only the small ASR engine and the in-
terpretation engine. 
3.1 Components of Speech Translation 
System 
S-MINDS has a modular architecture with the 
components described below. All of these com-
ponents already exist, so they will not need to be

  Speaking Multilingual Interactive Natural Dialog 
System 
developed to conduct the research proposed in 
Phase I. 
3.1.1 ASR Engine 
S-MINDS employs multiple acoustic engines so 
the best engine can be chosen for each language. 
Within each language, two separate language 
models are active at the same time, telling the 
ASR engines which words and phrases to recog-
nize. A smaller, more directed language model 
with higher accuracy is used to capture important 
and frequently used concepts. For less frequently 
used concepts, a larger language model that gen-
erally has broader coverage but somewhat lower 
accuracy is used. The combination of these two 
provides high accuracy for responses that can be 
anticipated and slightly lower accuracy but 
broader coverage for everything else. This 
method also allows development of new domains 
with very little data?for each domain, only a 
new domain-specific small language model 
needs to be built.   
3.1.2 Interpretation Engine 
Fluential has created an interpretation engine that 
is an alternative to an SMT engine. The S-
MINDS interpretation engine uses information 
extracted from the output of the ASR engine and 
then performs a paraphrase translation in seman-
tic space. This process is similar to what human 
interpreters do when they convey the essential 
meaning without providing a literal translation. 
The advantage of an interpretation engine is that 
new domains can be added more quickly and 
with less data than is possible with an SMT en-
gine. For high?volume, routine interactions, an 
interpretation engine can be extremely fast and 
highly accurate; however, the translation may 
lose some of the nuance. Again, this means that 
highly accurate target applications can be built 
with very little data?only a few examples of 
each concept are needed to train the interpreta-
tion engine.  
3.1.3 Statistical Machine Translation En-
gine  
For the S-MINDS SMT engine, Fluential is de-
veloping a novel approach that has generally im-
proved the accuracy of speech translation sys-
tems.2 This approach capitalizes on the intuition 
that language is broadly divided into two levels:

implemented.

structure and vocabulary. Traditional statistical 
approaches force the system to learn both types 
of information simultaneously. However, if the 
acquisition of structural information is kept sepa-
rate from the acquisition of vocabulary, the re-
sulting system should learn both levels more ef-
ficiently. And by modifying the existing corpus 
to separate structure and vocabulary, we have 
been able to take full advantage of all the infor-
mation in the bilingual corpus, producing higher-
quality MT without requiring large bodies of 
training data. The most recent modification to 
this approach was the use of distance-based or-
dering (Zens and Ney, 2003) and lexicalized or-
dering (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) to allow for 
multiple language models, including non-word 
models such as part-of-speech improved search 
algorithm, in order to improve its speed and effi-
ciency.   
3.1.4 VUI+GUI System 
S-MINDS has a flexible user interface that can 
be configured to use VUI only or VUI+GUI for 
either the English speaker or the second-
language speaker. Also, the English speaker can 
experience a different user interface than the sec-
ond-language speaker. The system has the flexi-
bility to use multiple types of microphones, in-
cluding open microphones, headsets, and tele-
phone headsets. Speech recognition can be con-
firmed by VUI, GUI, or both, and it can be con-
figured to verify all utterances, no utterances, or 
just utterances that fall below a certain confi-
dence level.   
3.1.5 Synthesis Engine 
S-MINDS can use text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis 
throughout the system; alternatively, it can use 
TTS in its SMT-based system and chunk-based 
recordings that are spliced together in its inter-
pretation engine. Fluential licenses its TTS tech-
nology from Cepstral, and other vendors.   In 
general we do not expect to be doing any re-
search and development activities in this area, as 
Cepstral can easily create good synthesis models 
from the 10 hours of provided speech data 
(Schultz and Black, 2006, Peterson, 2007).   
4 System Building 
Fluential conducted fiver activities in order to 
build the system.  They included: (1) Defining 
the task, (2) Collecting speech data to model 
nurse-patient interactions, (3) Building and test-
ing a speech translation system in English and 
Spanish, (4) Using the system with patients and 
nurses and collecting data to measure system 
performance, and (5) Analyzing the results. 
To define the task, Fluential conducted a two-
hour focus group with six registered nurses from 
Med/Surg unit of Kaiser Medical Center in San 
Francisco. In this focus group, the nurses identi-
fied six nurse-patient encounter types that they 
wanted to use for the evaluation.  These were:  
(1) Greeting/Goodbye, (2) Vital Signs, (3) Pain 
Assessment, (4) Respiratory Assessment, (5) 
Blood Sugar, (6) Placement of an I.V. 
Fluential then collected speech data over a four-
week period by recording nurse-patient interac-
tions involving 11 nurses and 25 patients. Fluen-
tial also recruited 59 native Spanish speakers 
who provided speech data using an automated 
system that walked them through hypothetical 
scenarios and elicited their responses in Spanish. 
The English recognizer had a vocabulary of 
2,003 and it was trained with 9,683 utterances.   
The Spanish recognizer had a vocabulary of 822, 
and it was trained with 1,556 utterances.   We 
suspect that the vocabulary size in Spanish would 
have been much bigger if we had more data. 
5 System Evaluation  
After building and testing the speech translation 
system, Fluential conducted a two-hour training 
session for each of the nurses before using the 
system with patients. A bilingual research assis-
tant explained the study to patients, obtained 
their consent, and trained them for less than five 
minutes on the system. Nurses then used the sys-
tem with Spanish-speaking patients for the six 
nurse-patient encounters that were built into the 
system. The system was used by three nurses 
with eleven patients for a total of 95 nurse-
patient encounters creating a total of 500 conver-
sation segments.3 
To protect patients from a mistranslation, each 
encounter was remotely monitored by a bilingual 
interpreter, who immediately notified the nurse 
any time the system mistranslated. Each encoun-
ter was recorded, transcribed, and translated by a 
human.

  A conversation segment is a single con-
tinuous sequence of speech in a single language 
plus the translation of what was said. 
56
The human translations were compared to the 
system?s translations and given a score using the 
Laws Methodology of either Good, Fair, Poor, 
Mistranslated, or Not Translated. (Laws, 2004).  
If a translation were scored as Good or Fair, it 
was considered accurate. If the translation were 
scored as Poor, Mistranslated, or Not Translated, 
it was considered inaccurate. 
Table 2 and 3 give examples of how we have 
used Law?s method to grade actual interaction 
results from nurses and patients.

achieve 80% accuracy using the Laws Method-
ology. Out of 500 conversation segments, the

Figure 3: Accuracy for Nurse Conversational 
Segments 
The biggest problem with system performance 
with nurses was with mistranslations. When 
nurses tried to say things that were not in the sys-
tem, the system tried to map their utterances to 
something that was in the system. In each case of 
mistranslation, the system told the nurse what it 
was about to translate, gave the nurse a chance to 
stop the translation, and then translated the 
wrong thing when the nurse did not respond. We 
believe that system performance can be greatly 
improved in by collecting more speech data from 
patients and nurses, making changes to the user 
interface, and improving our training program.

Figure 4: Results for Patients 
All of the problems with system performance 
with patients were with responses that the system 
was not able to translate. The system never gave 
a Poor translation or Mistranslated. So there were 
times when the nurse knew that the patient tried 
to say something that the system could not trans-
late, but there was never a time when the system 
gave the nurse false information. However, this 
percentage is quite high, and in a large context, it 
might cause additional problems. 
6.3 Nurse Survey Results 
After each time using the system, the nurses 
completed a user satisfaction survey that had five 
statements and asked them assign a 1-to-5 Likert 
score to each statement with 1 meaning 
?Strongly Disagree? and 5 meaning ?Strongly 
Agree.? Average scores for each question were: 
4.7  The speech translator was easy 
to use. 
4.5  The English voice was fluent 
and easy to understand. 
4.4  I understood the patient better 
because of the speech translator. 
4.5  I feel that I am providing better 
medical care because of the speech translator. 
4.7  I would like to use the speech 
translator with my patients in the future. 
6.4 Patient Survey Results 
The patients also completed a similar user satis-
faction survey, translated to Spanish, after using 
the system. Their average scores for each ques-
tion were: 
4.6  The speech translator was easy 
to use. 
4.8  The Spanish voice was fluent 
and easy to understand. 
4.7  I understood my nurse better be-
cause of the speech translator. 
5.0  I feel that I am receiving better 
medical care because of the speech translator. 
4.9  I would like to use the speech 
translator with my nurse in the future. 
 
6.5 ANOVA Testing 
We conducted Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
testing to evaluate whether there were any sig-
nificant variations in translation accuracy by pa-
tient, nurse, or encounter type. There were no 
significant differences. 
7 Discussion  
We were able to build and evaluate a system in 3 
months and show its utility by nurses and pa-
tients in clinical setting.   The system seemed to 
work and was liked by both nurses and patients.  
The next question is whether such a system can 
scale and cover a much larger domain, and how 
much data and training is required to accomplish 
this.
