The purpose  of this cont r ibut ion  is to 
fo rmulate  ways in wh ich  the homonymy of so- 
ca l led  'Modal  Par t i c les '  and the i r  e tymons  
can be handled.  Our aim is to show that not 
on ly  a s t ra tegy  for  this type of homonymy 
can be worked  out, but a lso a fo rmal i za t ion  
of in fo rmat ion  beyond propos i t iona l  content  
can be in t roduced  w i th  a v iew to its MT ap- 
p l i ca t ion .  
1. In t roduct ion  
Dur ing  the a lmost  40 years  of its ex is t -  
ence mach ine  t rans la t ion  has undergone  a con- 
s iderab le  re f inement  in the f ie lds  of both  
syntact i c  pars ing  and semant ic  representa -  
tion. The deve lopment  of MT can be seen as a 
tendency  to incorporate  more  and more l in- 
gu is t i c  knowledge  into \[:he fo rmal i za t ion  of 
t rans la t iona l  p rocesses .  Formal i za t ion  has 
thus become a keyword  for MT and has had sev- 
era l  ma jor  imp l i ca t ions .  F i rs t ly ,  it re fers  
to the hypothes is  that  everyth ing  re la ted  to 
a g iven  language is s t r u c t u r e d in 
one way or another.  Secondly ,  fo rmal i za t ion  
is an o b j e c t i v e m e a n s of tes-  
t ing the va l id i ty  of the l ingu is t ' s  hypoth -  
eses about  l ingu is t i c  phenomena.  Th i rd ly ,  it 
invo lves  the l ingu is t ' s  h o p e that  any- 
th ing that has to do w i th  language can in 
fact  be fo rmal i zed .  
At present ,  there are severa l  semant ic  
theor ies  wh ich  cou ld  be labe l led  " formal  se- 
mant ics" .  They are preoccup ied  w i th  exp lo -  
r ing  the propos i t iona l  content  of d i f fe rent  
text -un i t s  and they do not deal  w i th  the 
phenomenon of "sub jec t iv i ty" .  Sub jec t iv i ty ,  
or se l f -express ion ,  as \]Lyons /1981, 240/ has 
po in ted  out, "cannot  be reduced  to the ex- 
p ress ion  of p ropos i t iona l  knowledge  and be- 
l iefs".  If we th ink of MT in its ideal  form, 
i.e. not as an abst rac t ing  device,  but as a 
sys tem produc ing  automat ic  t rans la t ion ,  then 
the inadequacy  of res t r i c t ion  to propos i -  
t iona l  content  wi \ ] l  be ev ident?  
The present  paper  sets out to show that 
the express ion  of lex ica l  sub jec t iv i ty ,  con- 
veyed by moda l  par t i c les ,  should,  and can, 
be accounted  for in the process  of MT. 
2. Par t i c le  Homony_my 
Let us cons ider  the fo l low ing  pa i rs  of 
sentences :  
i a. There  is ~n~u a l i t t le  beer  left. 
b. ~ was  ? ~  too p leased  to leave  that  
p~ace.  
2 a. Nur  ihn hat te  man vergessen .  
b. Woz~ babe ich nut  ge lebt?  
3 a. Vous par tez  dd ja?  
b. Comment  vous  vous  appe lez  dd ja?  
4 a. ~pu~oCume ~ ~a~ u saempa.  
b. ~ u ~le enam, ~mo c~asamo.  
5 a. Ann~ is e l j~n  hozzdnk?  
b. Hol  is ta r to t tunk?  
The words  under l ined  in the b. example  of 
each pa i r  of sentences  be long  to a word-  
group now more or less un i fo rmly  re fer red  to 
as 'Modal Par t ic les '  /cf. A rndt  1960/. 
These words  represent ,  in Arndt ' s  term, 
a granunatical no -man 's - land ,  a l though in the 
past  ten years  there has been a cons iderab le  
in teres t  towards  moda l  par t i c les .

Words l ike the Engl ish ~ or the Ger- 
man nur present two problems from the point 
of v iew of machine translat ion.  On the one 
hand, they are ambiguous and their homonymy 
1~/st be resolved. On the other hand, when 
such lexemes are used as modal part ic les,  
their "translat ion" causes serious problems 
since we can rarely translate the modal 
into German as nut, or, say, into Hungar ian 
as csak. 
3. Resolut ion of Homon?my 
As far as homonymy is concerned, clear- 
ly the task is to set up formal rules for 
the categor izat ion of a given word as op- 
posed to its a l ternat ive morpholog ica l  and 
syntact ic status. 
The impl icat ion of the ass ignat ion of 
such homonymous lexemes to certain classes 
of words is by no means a matter  of "simple" 
select ion restr ict ion at surface level. Each 
modal part ic le  has preserved much of its 
etymon's syntact ic and semantic propert ies.  
Given this, it fol lows that the ambiguity 
may be resolved by construct ing small "sub- 
grammars" for each of these part icles, so as 
not only to set them apart from their homo- 
nyms, but also to take into cons iderat ion 
the whole co~nunicat ive content of the sen- 
tence. 
Thus, a subgrammar recogniz ing on l \ [  - 
either as a logical operator, with its re- 
str ict ive meaning, or as a modal particle, 
with its vague and, in a sense, antonymous 
meaning -- would have to be capable of manipu-  
lating informat ion from di f ferent levels. By 
compar ing sentences /la/ and /ib/ it could 
be concluded that, say, ~ is an operator  
when it precedes an NP /e.g. Det + Adj + N/  
and is a part ic le when fol lowed by too. But 
this assumption can readi ly be proved faulty 
by cons ider ing /6/: 
/6/ I f  ~ you had come, you could  have 
saved me a lot of trouble. 
It is commonly held that, in order to 
parse sentences, one needs strategies for 
locat ing verbs and their complements,  assign- 
6O 
ing words to var ious categories,  depending 
on context /Lehrberger 1982, 102/. The rec- 
ogni t ion of part ic les can be done main ly  by 
start ing from semantic representat ions  which 
should contain informat ion concerning both 
the propos i t iona l  content of sentences and 
their extrapropos i t ional ,  or subject ive mo- 
dal content. Thus, ass igning ~ to par- 
t icles would imply an a lgor i thm roughly de- 
f ined as: "If the lexeme ~ is used with a 
word that has no restr ict ive component  in 
its meaning, then it is a part ic le;  other-  
wise it is an operator".  
Pars ing along these l ines would mean a 
very compl icated presentat ion of d i f ferent  
parts of speech, inc luding not only NPs, 
made up of adject ives,  nouns, but also ad- 
verbs, pronouns and even phrases to account 
for ~n~ construct ions  l ike /6/. In addition, 
a very sophist icated and precise def in i t ion  
of the res t r i c t ion /non- res t r i c t ion  opposi-  
t ion would have to be set up. 
Obviously, the d i f f i cu l ty  of ass igning 
homonymous lexemes to modal  part ic les,  on 
the one hand, and to operators,  intensi f iers,  
adverbs,conjunct ions,  and the like, on the 
other, l ies in the fact that the former bear 
a re lat ionship  to the overal l  meaning of the 
sentence, whi le the latter add their meaning 
to the global meaning only via some lower 
level of semantic structure. 
From the above cons iderat ion it fol lows 
that it would be a fair ly tedious and prob- 
ably unreasonable  task to attempt to resolve 
this kind of  homonymy by the a lgor i thmiza-  
tion of abstract  sense-components.  
Instead, it might  be suff ic ient  to con- 
struct a subgran~ar to check ~ and other 
homonyms solely by reason of their  being a 
particle. One way to make the informat ion 
contained in the subgrammar avai lable to the 
parser may be to indicate, in the d ic t ionary  
entry of the homonym, all the cases in which 
the given word could poss ib ly  appear as a 
part ic le.  
In English, or French, the reso lut ion 
of ambiguity would mean sett ing up as few as 
6-10 subgrammars, whi le in German, Russian 
or Hungar ian there are scores of homonymous 
part ic les and, consequently,  subgrammars.  In 
addition, the latter languages make quite 
f requent use of part ic le  combinat ions which 
do not, as a rule, der ive their  meanings 
f rom a complement of the two /or more/ par- 
ticles, but have some di f ferent  meaning, cf. 
/7/ Csak hem fdztdl meg? 
/8/ Yx ~e npocmyCunc~ nu m~? 
Nevertheless,  there seems to be no reason 
why these combinat ions could not be inc luded 
in the subgrammar under one or the other  dic- 
t ionary entry. 
4. Trans lat ion of Modal  Part ic les  
Whi lst  intensi f iers,  conjunct ions,  oper-  
ators, pronouns, or adverbs have meanings 
which may be cons idered more or less "univer- 
sal", the semantics of part ic les takes us 
into a f ie ld speci f ic  to a part icu lar  lan- 
guage. In other words, using ~ as an oper-  
ator is "almost" ident ical  to using, say, 
nur~ or seulment, or csah etc. as an Oper- 
ator in German, French or Hungar ian respect-  
ively. But when it comes to part icles, we 
may exper ience d i f f icu l t ies  in preserv ing 
the operator  equiva lent  of onl~ in the trans- 
lation of sentences like /ib/ into any other 
language. 
One poss ib le solution, as with lots of 
d i f ferent  types of translat ion,  would  simply 
be to consider  these words i r re levant from 
the point  of v iew of propos i t ional  content 
matching. However, it would seem more plaus- 
ible to try to f ind equivalents  to these par- 
t icles in the target language since, depend- 
ing on the type of context to be translated, 
the express ion of subject iv i ty  may play a 
major  role in produc ing the actual co~nuni-  
cative message. 
Funct ional  equiva lence is a not ion fre- 
quent ly  used in l inguist ic  theory /Arnol 'd 
1976; Sanders 1980/, and it can be appl ied 
as a yardst ick  in part ic le  match ing /Fig. i/. 
A study of modal  part ic le  t rans lat ion is now 
being undertaken in Szeged Univers i ty 's  Eng- 
l i sh-Hungar ian MT project  and it is based 
on funct ional  equivalence. 
Those researchers who study MT in re- 
str icted semantic domains might over look 
the problem of the subject iv i ty  of the dif- 
ferent texts. It should be noted, however, 
that "most of the unexpected structures one 
finds in a sublanguage text can be associ-  
ated not so much with a shift in semantic 
domain as with a shift  /usual ly quite tem- 
porary/ in the att i tude which the text pro- 
ducer takes towards his domain of discourse" 
/Kittredge 1982, 135/. But even with aca- 
demic papers it happens to be the case that 
dur ing their  t rans lat ion one should be aware 
of the appearance of some subject ive over- 
tone lest some mist rans lat ion  should ensue. 
In this respect, consider the fo l lowing two 
examples with on/\]/ as a particle: 
/9/ Onl? too often have far-reaching con- 
clusions been drawn from inadequate 
data col lected from a limited number 
of languages. /U l lmann:Semant ic  Uni- 
versals,  1966, p. 218/ 
/\].0/ Similarly, it is ~nl~_ natural that 
verbs for "snoring" should in many 
languages contain an /r/... /Op. cit. 
p. 225/
