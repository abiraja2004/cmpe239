Lexical decay is the phenomenon underlying the dating tech- 
niques known as "glottochronology" and"lexicostatistics." Much  of 
the contraversial nature of work  in this field is the result of extremely 
imprecise foundations and lack of attention to the underlying statistical 
and semantic models. 
A satisfactory semantic mode l  can be found in the concept of se- 
mantic atom. Notwithstanding a number  of philosophical objections, 
the semantic a tom is an operationally feasible support for a lexicon 
which is a semantic subset of all possible meanings and at the same 
time, exhausts the vocabulary of a language. Lexical decay is the 
process by which the lexical item covering an a tom is replaced by 
another lexical item. 
Exponential lexical preservation is, in this model, directly 
analogous to decay phenomena in nuclear physics. Consistency re- 
quires that the decay process involved in exponentially preserved 
vocabularies be a Poisson process. This shows how to form test 
vocabularies for dating and proves that presently used vocabularies 
are not correctly formed. 
Dialectation studies show that historically diverging populations 
must  be model led by correlated Poisson processes. Definitive sta- 
tistical treatment of these questions is not possible at this time, but 
much desirable research can be indicated.

In t roduct ion  
Th is  paper  is  an a t tempt  to es tab l i sh  the  method  of  dat ing  by 
lex ica l  decay  upon an adequate  theoret i ca l  foundat ion .  The  method  
d iscussed  is  that  invented  by Swadesh  (1) over  a decade  ago  and  
usua l ly  known as  g lo t tochrono logy  or  lex icos ta t i s t i cs .  In  the  in ter -  
ven ing  years  i t  has  been  w ide ly  app l ied ,  but  o f ten  to the accompa-  
n iment  of  much confus ion  and  cont raversy .  It  seems that  much of  
the  confus ion  can  be removed by a r igorous  t reatment  of  the  phenom-  
eno log ica l  mode l  and  care fu l  app l i ca t ion  of  s ta t i s t i cs .  The  cont raversy  
can  be removed on ly  by the complet ion  of  a su f f i c ient  number  of  
suppor t ing  s tud ies .  R igorous  fo rmulat ion  permi ts  us  to 'p inpo in t  
what  s tud ies  a re  needed and  what  conc lus ions  a re  be ing  sought .  
Grant ing  (as not  everyone  seems w i l l ing  to do) that  the  bas ic  
fac t  of  "un i fo rm"  lex ica l  decay  occurs ,  the prob lem to be a t tacked  
is  that  of  cor rec t ly  fo rmulat ing  mode ls  fo r  lex ica l  decay  and  of  
cor rec t ly  der iv ing  s ta t i s t i ca l  consequences  f rom these  mode ls .  In 
what  fo l lows ,  we w i l l  const ruct  a se t  of  mode ls  wh ich  seem to f i t  
the needs  of  the  method  of dat ing  by  lex ica l  decay ,  Our  approach  
is  s t r i c t ly  p ragmat ic ,  that  i s ,  we const ruct  the mode l  we need w i th -  
out  concern ing  ourse lves  about  i t s  a p r io r i  reasonab leness .  La ter  
we t ry  to assemble  some arguments  wh ich  jus t i fy  the mode l .  In no 
sense is this an approach for first principles. 
The analogy between lexical decay and the decay phenomena 
of nuclear physics has been often noted and dismissed. In the pre-  
sent paper, we  insist that this analogy is much more  than an analogy; 
it is, on the first level, an identity. The only alternative to this 
hypothesis seems to be a kind of myst ic  faith that the decay occurs 
but without palpable manipulable principles. The burden of the proof 
that the identity is false lies with the doubter and we will make  no 
further demonstrat ion of its validity. 
Kleinecke - Z 
Decay phenomena in nuclear physics are governed by relatively 
simple, well understood principles. To apply these results to lexical 
decay we first establish the concepts of a semantic a tom and a set of 
independent semantic atoms. The observed fact of exponential decay 
of vocabulary then is accounted for by assuming that the lexical item 
covering an a tom decays according to a Poisson process. Oenerally 
speaking, the converse of this is also true,and only a Poisson process 
would produce exponential decay. F rom these considerations, we  
can draw many conclusions about how to and how not to construct test 
vocabularies for dating purposes. 
With this mode l  in hand, we  can draw conclusions of a statistical 
nature. For  example, we  can develop formulas for the proper method 
of dating the split between three or more  languages and for good esti- 
mators  in more  complex  situations. 
We can construct an inprecise heuristic model  for the dynamic 
semantics underlying the Poisson process. So long as the first order 
theory is adequate, this is much in the nature of a curiosity. It seems, 
however, that first order theory is not adequate. Actually, such a 
conclusion is really premature  because the kind of verification studies 
needed have not been made.  Assuming  the pessimistic conclusion, we  
have to construct second (or higher) order theories to account for the 
inadequacies of first order theory. At the moment ,  we  have no useful 
results in this direction--the prob lem merges  into the prob lem of 
dialectation. Probably the most  important service we can render is 
to indicate exactly what kind of detailed studies are needed. 
Semantic Atoms 
It is very easy to raise objections of a philosophical nature to 
the concept of a semantic atom. In this paper we will simply ignore 
Kleinecke - 3 
these objections and define semantic a tom in an operational way. 
There  are also operational difficulties, but these seem to be sur- 
mountable. 
A semantic a tom is a 
ciently specified to remove 
completely defined unit concept suffi- 
all ambiguity. For  example,  in an 
anthropological context, we  might have "sun, as pointed at by a male  
anthropologist at high noon in the middle of summer  on an average 
day among a group of young men with plenty to drink". The kind of 
subtilities needed to complete the definition reminds  one of Korzybsk ian  
General  Semantics, but the intention is not the same. We seek to 
remove ambiguity but we must  have a non-unique concept--one that is 
always present. 
Certainly there has been little use of semantic a toms anywhere  
in the past. Those interested in semantics for its own self will reject 
them as useless or meaningless; lexographers deal in more  generalized 
concepts. It would be hard to argue that they have general utility, but 
they are precisely what is needed for studying lexical decay. 
Each  semantic atom, in any speech at any time, is assumed to 
be covered by some lexical item. That is, there is some word  whose  
mean ing  includes that of the atom. Thus, vocabularies can be fo rmed 
over any set of semantic a toms by listing the covering lexical i tem 
for each atom. The kind of decay being studied is that where  the cov- 
ering lexical i tem is replaced by another item. The replaced word  
only rarely immediate ly  disappears f rom the language as a whole, but 
it has  disappeared f rom the semantic atom. 
An  independent set of semantic a toms is a set of a toms all of 
which differ among themselves enough to make the decay at any a tom 
completely independent of that at any other atom. Thus, only one f rom 
sets of words, like numera ls  or pronouns, with habitual interrelations 
K le inecke  - 4 
can appear i n  the set. Independent sets are useful because in 
them, prob lems of inter-atom correlations need not be considered. 
Before passing on, we  should say a few words  as to the prac- 
tical use of semantic atoms. There  does not seem to be any doubt 
that the collectors of vocabularies want  to work  with semantic a toms- -  
even if their results are completely unsuccessful. In an entry "dog= 
hund" they would  like to say that there is a semantic a tom and its cover 
in English is "dog", in German,  "hund". The pitfalls of this sort of 
thing are wel l -known. Some care in defining atoms might  make it 
feasible if we  require not complete identity of the English and German 
semantics, but rather the existence of some concrete concept where  
both the English and German words  are appropriate. Clearly this much 
weaker  requi rement  will be easier to satisfy, so we adopt it. 
We conclude that, with adequate precautions, semantic a toms 
can be operationally feasible even if true rigor is impossible. In the 
case of little-known languages, there is much more  chance for error. 
We should encourage collectors of vocabularies to improve  the pre- 
cision of their definitions so that the a tom in question can be identified. 
Decay  Process  
We assume that lexical decay, for a set of independent semant ic  
atoms, is a Po isson process. That is, it satisfies three conditions: 
i. Each  a tom decays independently of all the other atoms. 
2. Each  a tom decays independently of its history of earlier 
de c ay. 
3. There  is a constant k such that for each a tom the pro- 
bability of one decay in a short t ime interval At is kAt, 
and the probability of more  than one decay is negligible. 
Kle inecke  - 5 
It is rather easy to deduce that for longer time intervals t , 
the probability of not decaying is exp(-It) , and if there are N atoms, 
the expected  number  of undecayed atoms a f te r  t ime t is Nexp( - l t ) .  
Th is  fo rmula  is the usua l  fo rmula  fo r  lex ica l  decay .  It shou ld  
be po in ted  out  that  it  was  tes ted ,  s ta t i s t i ca l ly ,  in the f i r s t  pub l i ca t ion  
by Swadesh ,  and it fa i led  to pass .  The d i f f i cu l ty  is p robab ly  due to 
the word  l i s t  used  wh ich  is  not  an independent  set  of a toms.  
If we examine  the assumpt ions  made so fa r ,  we see  that  any  
l i s t  of semant ic  a toms can  be used  i f  they  are :  (1) independent ;  and 
(2) assured  of ex is tence  throughout  he t ime in quest ion .  There  is  no 
sat i s fac tory  a pr io r i  bas i s  fo r  assuming  that  some k inds  of semant ic  
a toms decay  at d i f fe rent  ra tes  than o ther  k inds ,  and it  is doubt fu l  i f  
enough h is tor i ca l  ev idence  can  be co l lec ted  to make such a conc lus ion  
s tat i  s t i ca l ly  s ign i f i cant .  
The quest ion  whether  l is a un iversa l  constant ,  a constant  
w i th in  any  one language but poss ib ly  d i f fe r ing  between languages ,  o r  
a var iab le ,  is eas ie r  to d i scuss .  So fa r ,  ind icat ions  are  that  k is  
about  equa l  to 1 /5000 years .  Now th is  means  that  over  the span of  
most  h i s to r i c  ev idence ,  exp( -k t )  wi l l  be greater  than about  0. 60. 
There  is a great  dea l  of scat ter  to be expected  in the resu l ts  because  
N exp( -k t )  is an expectat ion ,  not  an exact  p red ic t ion .  
There  have  been a number  of s tud ies  of  the exponent  of  expo-  
nent ia l  decay .  Al l  of them are  too super f i c ia l  to be conc lus ive  (Z) . 
An adequate  s tudy  in any  one language wou ld  have  to meet  severa l  
c r i te r ia  wh ich  make it into a major  research  e f fo r t .  A set  of inde-  
pendent  semant ic  a toms must  be se lec ted- -se lec ted  pr io r  to deta i led  
s tudy- -and  no a toms,  however  d i f f i cu l t ,  d ropped w i thout  complete  
exp lanat ions  (3).  Then  the h i s tory  of each  a tom must  be t raced  through 
the h i s tor i ca l  record  to locate  the lex ica l  i tem cover ing  the a tom at  
Kleinecke - 6 
each point in time. In reporting the study, all of this should be fully 
documented  in detail. Each  instance of decay can then be recognized 
and tallied. Statistical tests should be applied to see whether or not 
the mode l  is satisfied and to estimate )~ . For  example, if there are 
i00 semantic i tems T, there should be about one decay every 50 years 
uniformly spread through time. These things can be checked statis- 
tically. We hope that scholars will undertake definitive studies of this 
type for as many cases as possible (4). 
Until the results of the kind of research just ment ioned are avail- 
able, the status of ~ is unsure. We anticipate it will be recognized 
as a universal constant. 
There  remains  the prob lem of mak ing  a Poisson process a rea- 
sonable assumption. In other words, we  need to describe some sort 
of mechan ism which makes  words  slip off semantic atoms independently 
of how long they have been covering the atom, and at a constant rate 
per unit time, at least over short t ime intervals. Incidentally, 
since )~ is on the order of 1/5000 years, 50 years is a short time 
interval. Since the speakers of normal  languages are not historians, 
the independence f rom history seems easy to accept. 
The constant rate is harder to accept. First of all we  have to 
account for an identical figure in populations, literate and illiterate, 
and between a handful of speakers and half a billion speakers. The 
decay effect must  be independent of the number  of speakers, hence it 
must  be operative at the level of the single isolated speaker. This is 
satisfactory since, by and large, the amount  of speech reaching an 
individual does not seem to have changed much throughout history and 
does not vary much between cultures at the present day. 
But why  does a speaker decide to change an occasional lexical 
i tem--about i~0 in his lifetime--and maintain the rest. The only 
Kleinecke - 7 
hypothesis we  have been able to construct is that all words  are always 
under pressure - -perhaps  f rom several semantic  "directions" at the 
same time. Most  a toms resist change most  of the time, but some set 
of accidents (all very real events at the sociological and psychological 
levels, but random accidents in our context) weakens  a few, and the 
lexicon decays. In other words, there is a constant dynamic  move-  
ment  among secondary and incidental covers of the semantic a tom 
which threaten the principal cover. Usually the threatening lexical 
i tems recede, but occasionally, in a random way, about once every 
five thousand years the principal cover is displaced and a lexical de- 
cay occurs. 
The hypothetical mechan ism advanced to explain lexical decay 
can be checked against history by case studies of semantic atoms. 
Each  a tom should show time periods when the principal word  was  
nearly displaced. During these periods it is difficult to decide whether  
the old word  or a new word  is the principal cover. Usually the new 
word  will pass away again, but somet imes  it will displace the old word. 
A very tentative guess based on a casual examination of one hundred 
current English words  suggests there are about four very heavily 
threatened words  per hundred. Since we can expect about one word  
to be decaying at this moment ,  we  conclude that about three out of 
four times the old word  survives. All of this needs to be verified or 
disproven in detailed studies. 
Decay  Statistics 
The statistical consequences of the model - - the first order mode l  
described above- -need to be explored. We cannot handle all possible 
situations, but the following examples  should provide an adequate dem-  
onstration of technique so that any other p rob lems which occur can be 
solved in the same manner .

Le t  lal denote  the number  of languages  in ~.  If 10~1 = N,  the

If  a few cases - -  I~I = N-  1 , I~I : N-Z.  etc . - -a re  so lved ,  we are 
lead to hypothesize that 
P(~) = exp( -k t )  loci (1 - exp( -k t )  )N -  I~1 
This can be proven  by induction on \]~I f rom IO~l : IN downward  since 
IOC(~jl = I~I + I . Then

and the hypothesis is p roven  by induction. 
Thus, P(c~) depends  only on the value of Ic~l = n . We can rec- 
ognize P(n) for n=Z,  3 , . . . ,N  but P(0) and P(1) cannot be distin- 
guished so we combine  these into P'  wh ich  is obtained by

Now suppose  that  f rom K semant ic  a toms we observe  that  k N a toms 
are  covered  by the same word  in a l l  l anguages ,  and  kN_ 1 in  a l l  but

If N=Z , x a =ks /K ,  which is the we l l -known formula for the separa- 
tion between two languages. For  general N ,  is the solution of the 
X 
quatratic equation given above. Note that the answer  depends on the 
statistic A which does not usually appear in discussions of lexical 
dating. 
An  even more  general difference between this treatment and 
usual treatment by pairs is found in the use made of the number  of all 
the languages containing a certain lexical i tem as the cover of a se- 
mantic  atom. This kind of count is a lmost  never made in the literature 
on dating problems.  
Another  case which constantly recurs in practice is that of three 
languages; i, 2 and 3, say. "The pair 1 and 2 are more  closely 
Kle inecke - Ii 
related than language 3 is to either I or ? . Suppose  t is t ime 
f rom the common ancestor  of i, 2 and 3 to 3, and t' the t ime 
f rom the common ancestor of 1 and 2 to 1 or Z. Let x=exp(- I t )  , 
x = exp(-kt') so that x/x' is the probability associated with the 
t ime f rom the common ancestor of I, Z and 3 to that of 1 and 2.  
We might  observe  any of five situations concerning the cover  
of a semant ic  atom. It may be the same in all (i, Z, 3); or in any 
pair (I, 2), (i, 3) or (Z, 3), or different in each. The  probability of 
each of these events is

Supposing klz 3 , k~s, ks8 , kle and k' of each of these is observed  
when K a toms are considered. The  total probability is

l Maximum liklihood est imates for x and x are gotten f rom the

These equations are best solved numerical ly  for given values of k~s s, 
kls , kls, kss and k' . 
The  methodo logy  is straight-forward and there is no need to 
multiply examples.  In every case we obtain new formulas based on 
max imum liklihood estimators. Another area in which these methods  
could also be utilized is in the construction of significance tests and 
confidence bands. With this basis, most  of the mach inery  of modern  
statistics wou ld  be available for use. 
Crit icism of First Order  Theory  
As  we explained in discussing semantic atoms, we  feel there is 
no adequate observational data to which to apply these formulas for a 
conclusive test of their value. We have made a few experimental  
applications using the unsatisfactory data available in the literature. 
Numerical ly,  the time estimates we obtained, which we will 
not quote here, do not differ a great deal f rom those obtained by con- 
sidering pairs alone. This is to be expected if the phenomena are at 
all consistent. The  value in the formulas derived above lies in the 
fact that they correctly combine  the data f rom several pairs. 
The  first-order method does have one very important difficulty 
which appears a lmost  immediate ly  if we  try to treat more  than three 
languages. This difficulty is in the family tree of the languages. 
In the entire first-order development, we  have implicitly used 
the concept of a tree. Languages  go together as a "common ancestor" 
Kleinecke - 13 
until some point in t ime when they divide and become two separate 
languages. The  tree is the first-order mode l  of dialectation--it is 
known to be inadequate, at least in many situations. In spite of a 
century or so of studies, we  simply do not understand how dialec- 
tation occurs. More  study is greatly needed, especially in the con- 
struction of h igher-order  models,  but the prob lem lies outside the 
scope of this paper. 
The difficulty with the tree rises in decay studies because only 
splitting is compatible with our statistical model.  We have no alter- 
native to constructing a family tree if we  wish to apply the method 
outlined above. However ,  it seems to be easy to find examples  which 
do not allow a tree to be constructed. Consider four languages; A , 
B, C and D . Suppose one semantic a tom has the same cover in A 
and B, and another different cover in C and D . And  at the same 
time, some other a tom has one cover in A and C , and a different 
cover in B and D. We cannot fit this data into any family tree. 
A little more  specifically in the Romance  languages, we  find 
that the same innovation with respect to Latin is shared by several or 
all the later languages. Some of this can be explained by the colloquial 
versus learned speech theory, but no family tree can be constructed 
to explain all the combinations of innovations. If we  had an adequate 
explanation of the phenomena involved in these shared innovations, it 
is quite possible that we  could assume Romance  was  the direct descen- 
dent of Imperial  Latin without going back to Plautus or thereabouts, 
as seems to be required by the first order theory. 
A tentative beginning in this direction can be made by a second- 
order theory based on the dynamic  mode l  of lexical influence.

Second-Order  Lex ica l  Decay  
The  imprec ise  mode l  of  semant ic  p ressures  we fo rmed to 
exp la in  lex ica l  decay  suggests  the  fo l low ing  second-order  mode l .  
For  each  semant ic  a tom,  we cons ider  not  on ly  a cover ing  
lex ica l  i tem as  be fore ,  but  a l so  a potent ia l  cover ing  i tem.  The  poten-  
t ia l  cover  is  the  source  of  p ressure  aga ins t  the  cover .  When the  
cover  decays ,  i t  i s  rep laced  by the  potent ia l  cover .  Natura l ly  we 
a l so  assume that  the  potent ia l  cover  decays  and  is  rep laced  by a 
new potent ia l  cover .  In the  in teres t  of  s imp l i c i ty  and  because  we 
have  no numer ica l  data ,  we w i l l  assume both  decays  have  the same 
constant k 
First, let us consider a single language. The situation at an 
a tom can be of four types: (1) both the original cover and potential 
cover remain; (If) the original cover remains, but the potential 
cover has decayed; (III) the original cover has decayed and the poten- 
tial cover has replaced it; (IV) the cover is now neither the original 
nor the potential cover. 
Let Pl and PII be the probability of the first two situations.

which  has the solution 
P(&,~,?,6) = \[exp(-Xt)\] 21Ct{ + IBI + IYI \[1 - exp(-Xt)\] l~I + IYi + 2161 
We have no way  of recognizing the condition of the potential cover, so 
sets ez and ~ should be combined  into a set ~ and  
P(~,y, 6) = \[exp(-%t)\] Irll + Ivl \[I - exp(-%t}\] IYI + 2t61

Before we can actually apply the max imum liklihood technique to lan- 
guages without known ancestors, we  have to make Some further com-  
binations because sets with I~\]I = 1 can not be distinguished f rom 
those with I~I- o or those with I '~I -  i from those with l~J- 0 
Moreover ,  we  cannot distinguish original covers f rom potential covers 
so that two sets T\] and y must  be combined  with the same sets in 
the reverse order. 
The general case is very complicated, so we restrict ourselves 
to two languages. We then observe that the covers are either the 
same or different. If they are the same,  we have either I~ I = 2 and 
IYI = 161 = 0 ,or  I~{I = 2 and IT\]I = 161 = 0 Thus, the probability is 
\[exp(-kt)\] s + \[exp(-kt)\] s \[i - exp(-kt)\] s 
= exp(-Zkt) \[i + (i exp(-kt)) s\] 
which differs f rom the first order theory by the te rm in the square 
bracket. 
The simplest case where  the second-order theory is really re- 
quired is that of four languages. We will illustrate the results by one 
expression. If kss words  are covered by two items both in two lan- 
guages, k4 words  by one i tem in all languages, k 8 by one i tem in 
three languages, k s by one item in two languages, and k' by no 
common items,then the expression to be solved for max imum liklihood 
is 
4kss + 4k4 + 3k s +2k s 2kss  + k 3 + 3ks  + 5k '

+ 2 + 4p - p~ - p3 + 
k'(5 + 6p + 9p 2) 
+ 5p + 3p s + 3p s 
where  p = exp(-%t) . 
This second-order  theory is not satisfactory not only because 
it leads to very complex  formulas, but it also seems to be qualita- 
tively inadequate. The formula for splitting between two languages 
is not greatly modif ied except for very long times, and the change 
does not seem to be enough to account for data showing short t imes 
of division. It is hard to tell whether  the formula for several lan- 
guages including the quantity k2e is any help--so far we  have no 
striking results to quote f rom its use. 
A second-order  theory where  potential cover decayed at a 
different rate than the original cover might  correct some of these 
defects, but we  have no evidence upon which to estimate the decay 
rate in this case. It is much likely that a more  elaborate mechan ism 
must  be postulated--it need not lead to more  elaborate results. The 
mode l  must  be based on a kind of dialectation study which seems to 
be absent as yet f rom the literature. 
Conclusion 
We have derived a number  of formulas relating to the estimation 
of t ime depths by observations of lexical decay. The methods  used 
can be applied to obtain many more  similar formulas as required in 
studies of actual data. 
All of these formulas are based on mode ls  of lexical decay using 
the concept of semantic a toms and their lexical covers. Lexical decay 
Kle inecke  - 18 
is ident i f ied  wi th  a change in lex ica l  cover .  If the semant ic  a toms 
are  su f f i c ient ly  independent ,  the decay  is  a Po isson  process .  
P robab ly  the most  impor tant  p ract i ca l  conc lus ion  is the resu l t  
that  any set  of semant ic  a toms can be used  to eva luate  lex ica l  decay

There is no outstanding study of this problem. Attempts 
to " improve" the test vocabulary by limiting it to mean-  
ings which have behaved well in earlier studies are meth-  
odologically disasterous because they bias the value of k. 
This requirement is also intended to remove bias f rom 
the estimate of k . 
This is a matter of classical philological research inde- 
pendent of statistical syntheses made f rom the results.
