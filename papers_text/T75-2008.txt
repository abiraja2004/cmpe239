How should a proposit ion appear in 
memory? It s imply cannot be stored in a form 
that bears a strong relat ionship to the 
original form of the input in natural  
language. Since it is possible to say .the 
same thing in any number of different ways, 
it is unreasonable to suppose that people 
are constant ly  checking to see if a 
proposit ion that they have stored one way in 
memory is the same as another they have 
stored somewhere else in a different form. 
What is far more l ikely is that people have 
developed a kind of canonical  form. No two 
proposit ions in memory can be equivalent in 
this view, since the canonical  form for 
their meaning forces them to be represented 
in the same way and thus stored and treated 
in the same way by memory. 
A canonical  representat ional  scheme 
cannot have natural  language words as its 
elements. Words can be ambiguous and a 
meaning representat ion system must be 
unambiguous. Furthermore, words can be 
synonymous and over lap in meaning. By 
disal lowing synonymous canonical  forms of 
proposit ions we have also disal lowed the use 
of words in the representat ion.  
The consequences of this are consistent 
with what we know about people. In memory 
exper iments people consistent ly  exhibit 
recognit ion confusions because of their 
remembrance of the "gist" of a sentence 
rather than the words that they actual ly saw 
or heard. 
Conceptual  Dependency has as its basic 
premise that the ACTION is the basis of any 
proposit ion that is not descr ipt ive of a 
static piece of the world. 
All proposi t ions that describe events 
are made up of CONCEPTUALIZATIONS. A 
conceptual izat ion is composed of an ACTOR, 
an ACTION, and a set of cases that are 
dependent on that ACTION. 
The main insight of Conceptual  
Dependency theory is that there must be a 
canonical  form for meaning representat ions.  
The types of conceptual  roles that there are 
in this canonical  form do not correspond to 
syntact ic roles. Rather, words are broken 
down into their conceptual  parts and then 
placed in a meaning representat ion with 
respect to their conceptual  role rather than 
the syntact ic role that was chosen for them 
as a result of some, perhaps random, lexical 
choices. For example, the word "danger" has 
a nominal form, a verbal form (endanger), an 
adject ival  form (dangerous), and an 
adverbial  form (dangerously).  The meaning 
of the concept under ly ing "danger" is the 
same no matter what lexical form is selected 
to real ize that concept. Basical ly, 
"danger" means that something can possibly 
happen that wil l  result in a negative effect 
34 
in somebody's physical state. "Danger" is 
represented conceptual ly  as a 
conceptual izat ion l inked to a state 
description. Certain elements of the 
conceptual izat ion are unknown, but can be 
fi l led in by the words surrounding "danger'. 
The state descr ipt ion is part ia l ly known. 
It says that somebody's physical state may 
be negat ively changed. 
So we see that "endanger" is no more an 
act ion than it is an actor. Rather, 
"endanger" refers to a partial  conceptual  
structure. The word "endanger" also sets up 
an expectat ion that the syntactic subject of 
that verb wil l  contain the item that wil l  
help fill in the missing action that was 
"dangerous'. Thus, in the sentence "The 
bees endangered Bil l ," the "bees" are the 
actors of a conceptual izat ion that is 
causal ly related to the state descr ipt ion 
that the concept "Bill" wil l  undergo a 
negative change. The action is sti l l  
unknown, but now can be inferred. The 
memory is consulted for actions that bees 
are known to perform that endanger humans. 
The simplest explanat ion is preferred and 
the best candidate for the action is 
"sting'. The object of that action is 
"Bill'. The conceptual  representat ion of 
"The bee's endangered Bil l" says that "the 
bees may do an act ion (possibly "sting') 
which wil l  cause Bill to become hurt." 
We said before that words do not appear 
in conceptual izat ions.  Fol lowing that point 
of view it is obvious that "sting" cannot 
real ly sat isfy our needs here. The idea of 
"sting" is correct, but it must be broken 
down into its component parts. We define an 
act ion as something an actor can do to an 
object. We define an actor as an animate 
object, and an object as any concrete 
physical  object. "Sting" sti l l  works under 
these constraints,  but couldn't  we just have 
well  used the word "bite'? Although these 
two words are s l ight ly di f ferent in their 
strict interpretat ions,  to the average user, 
these words are synonyms. We are left with 
the problem of descr ib ing the concept 
under ly ing them in order to sat isfy the 
requirements that we have set out above. 
In order to handle s imi lar i t ies and 
overlaps in meaning as used by the man in 
the street we have developed the concept of 
the PRIMITIVE ACTION. Pr imit ive actions are 
intended to be the bui ld ing blocks out of 
which the meanings of verbs and abstract and 
complex nouns are constructed. The 
pr imit ives are not category names but rather 
elements that can be used in many varied 
combinat ions to express the meaning of what 
under l ies a given word. 
Conceptual  Dependency representat ions 
use only twelve pr imit ive acts. These acts 
were arr ived at by not ic ing structural  
s imi lar i t ies  that existed when sentences 
were put into an actor -act ion-ob ject  
framework. Using this set of acts, a larger 
set of states and a set of conceptual  roles, 
it is possible to express a large amount, if 
not all, of the meanings expressible in 
natural  language. We wil l  now descr ibe the 
most important of the primit ive ACTs and

brief ly mention the others. 
ATRANS The transfer of an abstract 
relat ionship such as possession, 
ownership or control. ATRANS 
requires an actor, object and 
recipient. 
ex. 
g ive=ATRANS an object from the 
actor to the recipient. 
take=ATRANS an object from 
someone to the actor. 
buy=two ATRANS actions, each 
causing the other. An 
ATRANS of money from the 
first actor to the second 
actor. An ATRANS of an 
object from the second to 
the first. 
PTRANS The transfer of physical location 
of an object. PTRANS requires an 
actor, object and direction. 
ex. 
go=PTRANS of an actor by an 
actor to a location. 
f ly=PTRANS of an actor to a 
location. Any ACT can have 
another act as its 
instrument. For "fly" that 
instrument is PROPEL. 
PROPEL The appl icat ion of a physical 
force to an object. If movement 
takes place as a result of a 
PROPEL, a PTRANS has taken place 
too if it can be determined that 
that PROPEL was intended by the 
actor. Direction, object and actor 
are required. 
ex. 
push=PROPEL an object in a 
direct ion by an actor. 
pul l=PROPEL an object in a 
direct ion (towards actor) by 
an actor. 
k ick:PROPEL an object in a 
direct ion by an actor using 
the instrument MOVE object 
foot. 
MTRANS The transfer of information 
between animals or within an 
animal. For the purpose of deal ing 
with the words people use to 
discuss memory, we part it ion memory 
into three pieces: the CP (the 
conscious processor9. Something 
being in CP means that it is being 
thought of at that moment. The IM 
(the intermediate memory) where 
current context is kept and 
contextual ly  relevant information 
is stored while in use. The LTM 
(long term memory) where informaton 
is stored. The various sense 
organs serve as the origins in an 
MTRANS. Recipient, object and 
actor are required, although here 
these cases refer to the above 
mental locations as recipients and 
mental information as possible 
objects. 
ex. 
remember:MTRANS information from 
LTM to IM 
35 
forget:MTRANS cannot be 
accompl ished on some 
information from LTM 
see:MTRANS information to IM 
from the eye 
tel l=an actor MTRANS 
information to another 
actor 
read=MTRANS information from 
a book to IM by means of 
ATTEND eye to the book. 
MBUILD The construct ion within an animal 
of new informaton from old 
information. MBUILDing takes place 
within IM and receives its inputs 
from the CP and from IM. It 
transforms them into a new idea and 
places that idea in the CP. 
ex. 
descr ibe=MBUILD a future action 
or a new state. 
imagine:MBUILD a new idea that 
is hypothetical  
consider=MBUILD from a mentioned 
input into an 
unspeci f ied output 
answer=MBUILD a specif ic output 
to somebody else's input 
that was just received 
in the CP. 
INGEST The taking in of an object by an 
animal into the inner workings of 
that animal. INGEST requires an 
actor, object, and direction. 
ex.. left margin 16 
eat=INGEST a solid into the body 
through the mouth 
breathe=INGEST air into the body through 
the mouth 
shoot up=INGEST a narcotic into the body 
through a vein by PROPEL narcotic 
through needle. 
smoke: INGEST smoke from a cigarette into 
the mouth by INGEST air through the 
cigarette. 
All conceptual izat ions require 
conceptual izat ions that are instruments for 
them. The remainder of the primitive ACTs 
are primari ly the ACTs of instrumental  
conceptual izatons.  They are: 
GRASP To grasp an object. 
ATTEND To focus a sense organ to an object. 
SPEAK To make a noise. 
MOVE To move a bodypart. 
EXPEL To push something out of the body. 
We have l isted above only one sense of 
each verb that we have chosen to describe. 
The power of the primit ive ACTs is that they 
can point up s imi lar i t ies between words 
{such as the use of ATRANS for "give', 
"take', and "buy" while also h ighl ight ing 
their differences. In addit ion they serve 
as a veh ic le  for d isambiguat ing ambiguous 
words. Thus, "smoke" as in "the barn is 
smoking- would not have INGEST in it but 
would use a state descr ipt ion involving 
"smoke" and "heat'. Similarly, "take" as in 
"take an aspir in" would be INGEST rather 
than ATRANS. A program that makes these 
disambiguat ions and assigns the correct 
conceptual  structure to an input sentence 
was wr i t ten by Riesbeck (1974). The program 
uses knowledge about how words fit together 
in Engl ish and some general  knowledge about 
the physical  world to make its dist inct ions. 
Upon encounter ing "take" for example, the 
program asks if there is an object around 
which is medicat ion.  It also must find out 
if the sentent ial  object is real ly " an 
action, as in "take a beating." If it is we 
have neither ATRANS or INGEST but a causal 
structure. This series of tests helps to 
determine the correct conceptual  sense for a 
word. 
The primit ive ACTs are useful for 
organiz ing the inference process. Rather 
than stating that if you see something, then 
you know it and if you hear something then 
you know it and if you read something then 
you know it and so on, we simply state that 
whenever an MTRANS exists, a l ikely 
inference is that the MTRANSed informat ion 
is in the mental  location LTM (our 
representat ion for "know'). This is a 
t remendous savings of time and space. For 
example, any number of forces can cause 
dif ferent kinds of state changes of damage, 
location and the like. By l ist ing the 
cr i ter ia that must be met for these 
inferences once under PROPEL, rather than 
under each indiv idual  verb that might call 
them up, we organize our knoweldge of facts 
and events in a very useful way. 
(Organiz ing the inferences under the 
ACTs also serves to define the ACTs 
themselves. The theoret ica l  decis ion for 
what const i tutes a pr imit ive ACT is based on 
whether  the proposed new ACT carries with it 
a set of inferences not already accounted 
for by an ACT that is already in use. 
Similar ly,  a pr imit ive ACT is dropped when 
we find that its inferences are already 
handled by another ACT.) 
We have recent ly added a new pr imit ive 
ACT cal led PLAN. PLAN is intended to 
account for an indiv idual 's  abi l i ty  to 
decide on a step by step course of act ion 
that leads to a goal. PLAN takes as input a 
goal and a set of possible plans that are 
known to be ways to achieve that goal. PLAN 
decides among them and produces as output a 
sequent ia l  chain of conceptua l izat ions  that 
the actor intends to act out in order to 
achieve the desired goal. PLAN takes MBUILD 
as its instrument where the items MBUILDed 
are the part icular  decis ions that make up 
the select ion of a given plan. 
The general  form of PLAN is with an 
object that takes as input a goal and the 
plans associated with that goal and produces 
as output the chain of acts that the actor 
intends to perform to achieve the goal. 
MBUILD is now redef ined as having an 
object that takes mult ip le inputs deal ing 
with the current facts and the logical 
consequences and bel iefs associated with 
those facts and produces a new thought which 
36 
may or may not be an intended future action.

The di f ference in these two ACTs with 
respect to their real izat ions in ENGLISH is 
as follows: 
John decided to go to the Bahamas. 
MBUILD new thought. 
John developed a plan to go to the 
Bahamas. 
PLAN unknown set of ACTs. 
GOAL that is input to ACT 
PLAN is known 
John knows how to get the money. 
PLAN with known goal. 
John f igured out who the murderer  is. 
MBUILD new thought 
John did that to get Mary to like him. 
PLAN 
John intended to hurt Mary. 
PLAN (ambiguous if no ACT was done.) 
John intends to hurt Mary. 
Ambiguous (not known if he has 
f igured out how) 
The d i f ferences with respect to inference 
are: 
MBUILD We can infer that the facts were 
there to make the decis ion and quest ion 
the app l i cab i l i ty  of those facts. 
PLAN We can infer that the steps to a goal 
were thought about before an ACT was 
taken. 
We MBUILD goals. We PLAN ways to get 
those goals to become reality. 
The idea of pr imit ive ACTs has met with 
a general  agreement that such a thing is in 
pr inc ip le reasonable on the one hand, and a 
general  uneasiness with the set that 
Conceptual  Dependency proposes on the other. 
Do we real ly need such a small set? Must we 
break down all words into these pr imit ives 
each and every t ime? How do you arr ive at 
the correct set? What about words like 
"drive" or "dance" or "hunt'? 
The answer to these quest ions is not 
simple. We never sought to create an 
extremely small set. We just happended on 
that set in the course of attempt ing to find 
out what the ent i t ies such as "understand3" 
and "believe1" that we were creat ing were. 
The set that we came up with has so far been 
adequate to handle a myriad of domains that 
we have tried. We expect that over time a 
di f ferent set than we are current ly  us ing 
wil l  emerge. However, our expectat ion is 
that the order of magni tude is correct. It 
should be possible to handle most wor lds 
with a very small  set.

The quest ion of whether we must break 
down everything we see in terms of primit ive 
ACTs seems to be the one that excites the 
most controversy. Wouldn't  it be simpler to 
use Engl ish words where we can and break 
down into pr imit ives only when we have to? 
Yes, it would be simpler to do that if we 
had a data base that had in it "John drives 
a red car" and we were asked "Who drives a 
red car?" Researchers who work with highly 
restr icted data bases probably have no need 
for primitive ACTs. But real understanding 
systems must be capable of handling qustions 
such as "Who was that I saw moving down the 
street on those fancy wheels??" or even just 
"Who parked that car over there?" Life is 
rarely as simple as naive question answering 
systems would like it to be. Real 
understanding implies knowing what the 
meaning of everything you hear is, before 
you attempt to process it in memory. The 
truth is that it just isn't any harder to 
map input sentences into conceptual izat ions 
involving the primit ive ACTs than to do a 
syntactic parse. (See the paper by Riesbeck 
in this volume.) 
But what about words such as "drive" 
and "dance'? The answer is that these words 
(and many others) have no simple meaning in 
Conceptual  Dependency terms. They are what 
we used to call SDO, meaning they were names 
of prescribed sequences of 
conceptual izat ions,  any subset of which 
might not be meant when the word was being 
used. These action sequences can be handled 
using the primit ive ACTs. The problem is in 
describing just what "drive" does mean. The 
answer is that it has a basic pr imit ive 
associated with it (PTRANS by PROPEL here) 
but it also has what we now (see Schank and 
Abelson \[1975\]) call a script. This script 
carries along with it all the mundane 
informat ion that is known about "drive'. 
In creat ing the primit ive ACTs we made 
no claim that these were the last pr imit ive 
entit ies that we would be creating. We are 
now working on a set of primit ives plans and 
planboxes (described by me in another paper 
in this volume). These higher level 
abstract entit ies serve to organize 
information about people's goals and plans. 
They work on top of the conceptual izat ions 
that are received as input. Knowledge 
organiz ing primit ives are every bit as 
important as event organiz ing primitives. 
It is important to realize why we are 
creating these abstract entit ies in memory. 
Basical ly, the reason for creating them is 
organization. A primit ive ACT in memory is 
useful for organiz ing inferences around. 
Whenever that ACT appears in a 
representat ion, we know that a certain body 
of knowledge appl icable to that ACT is going 
to be relevant. Pr imit ive or abstract 
construct ionns in a memory are there 
precisely because a given body of knowledge 
is frequently accessed as a unit whenever 
that abstract entity is accessed. 
Because we do not remember the or iginal  
inputs, the abstract entit ies that we create 
to represent them must serve a dual role. 
They must both accurate ly  represent the 
37 
meaning of the input as well as call up 
relevant bodies of knowledge that will be 
appl icable as data upon which to base  
inferences. This dual responsib i l i ty  of the 
conceptual  representat ion means that the 
abstract elements within that representat ion 
must be selected with respect to how they 
affect the other elements of the 
representat ion as well as whether they serve 
to organize informat ion in an eff ic ient 
manner. Since the primit ive ACTs must be 
more careful ly chosen, there are serious 
questions as to what can constitute an 
acceptable and workable set. 
These considerat ions do not hold in the 
s ituat ion where abstract entit ies are 
created and the input information is 
retained. Thus, in situations where 
conceptual  representat ions are to be 
evaluated for goals that are impl ic i t ly  
expressed within them, we are simply 
evaluat ing the input conceptual izat ions.  
They wil l  not be replaced by whatever new 
construct ions are invented. Thus, the 
select ion of these higher level abstract ions 
depends mainly on whether we can find a use 
for them. 
So, we are saying that there are many 
possible kinds of primitives. Primit ive 
act ions underl ie the words of a language. 
Operat ing on top of those primitives, and 
therfore af fected by them, are a set of 
pr imit ive knowledge organizat ion pieces. 
Gett ing at these is what  understanding 
understanding is all about.
