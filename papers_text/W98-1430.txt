1. INTRODUCTION 
The negative feedback loop which maintains a steady blood pressure in the human body is one of the 
more difficult topics for first-year medical students to master. CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 is the latest in a series 
of dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems intended to help students master the concepts involved. 
CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 differs from many other ITSs in that text planning is an integral part of the system 
rather than part of a natural-language front-end. It contains a global planner whose fundamental goal i s  
"generate a conversation resulting in the student knowing <concepts>" rather than "teach <concepts>." 
Constraints on the plan operators can be used to take a variety Of knowledge Sources into account, 
including the tutorial history, the domain knowledge base and a student model. 
To ensure that CIP, CSiM-Tutor is useful in the classroom, we have paid particular attention to broad 
coverage of the domain, maintenance ofa coherent conversation and fast response time. We often need to 
model what human tutors do without a deep model of why they say what they say. As a result our content 
planner uses a schema-based.representation whichallows us to control the decomposition a d sequence 
of goals. Through the use of a reactive planning architecture, we can update our plan based on the 
student's answers. Text realization is accomplished via a high-level template mechanism based on a 
mini-syntax of potential answers. Botl! the content schemata and the text realization templates are based 
on detailed modeling of the dialogu epatterns of expert human tutors. 
2, DESCRIPTION OF DOMAIN AND USER INTERFACE 
CIRCSIM-Tut0r helps students practice the reasoning they have learned in Introduction to Physiology. 
Students are given a simplified qualitative model of the heart, followed by a series of problems which 
utilize the model. In each problem, an incident such as the administration f a drug affects the processing

of file heart. The student is then asked to predict ile direction of change of seven core variables: 
HR: Heart rate (beats/min) MAP: 
IS: Inotropic state, a measure of the SV: 
heart's contractile ability " CVP: 
TPR: Total peripheral ?resistance CO: 
The qualitative causal relationships between the core variables (i.e. an increase in X causes an

Stroke volume (vol/beat) 
Central venous pressure

increase/decrease in Y) are shown on tlie left-hand side of Figure I. In this diagram, NS = nervous 
system and Baro = the baroreceptors in the neck which recognize a change in blood pressure. A finer- 
grained knowledge representation is also available for the tutor to usewhen needed. A section of this 
knowledge base, the leg from the nervous ystem to TPR, is shown on tlie right-hand side of Figure 1. 
Each variable must be Predicted at three points: the DR or direct response phase immediately after the 
incident, the RR or reflex response phase, which shows the effect of the nervous ystem, and the SS or 
steady state phase after a new steady state has emerged. After the predictions are made, ? the tutor engages 
the student in a dialogue to help the student learn the correct answers and file concepts underlying them. 
The basic user interface is tile screen shown in Figure 2. A description of  the current problem is shown at 
the top of the screen. The left-hand Side of the screen contains a table where the student can fill in 
predictions for tile three stages, and the right-hand side contains awindow where the dialogue volves. 
The student part of tile dialogue is free text. Instead of restricting what students can say, we attempt to 
guide them toward understandable responses through the way the questions are framed, e.g. by asking 
short-answer questions instead of open-ended ones. Input processing is based on finite-state transducers. 
Eachquestion the system can ask is associated with a transducer which can categorize and extract a 
variety of student answers. Often if the student just uses some of the right words, the sentence is accepted 
since the input processor uses very little syntax. Spelling correction, an essential in any system which 
allows free-text typing, is based on algorithms developed by Elmi \[1998\]. Tile transducers were coded by 
hand using as input both dialogues with human tutors and logs from earlier versions of CIRCSIM-Tutor.

3. DIALOGUES GENERATED BYTHE SYSTEM 
At the top levels, the conversation generated by the system is hierarchical. Within each stage, the text is 
divided into segments, one for each ?incorrect core variable. The variables are discussed in a partially 
ordered sequence which corresponds tothe solution trace of the problem. 
Each variable is tutored using one of a number of tutoring methods which we have isolated from studies 
of human tutoring transcripts. The tutoring methods are implemented using an extended form of schema 
which allows full unification, static and dynamic preconditions, and recursion. The following schema is 
typical (schemata are implemented in Lisp):

Each tutoring method is composed of a number of topics. Unless it includes a recursive call to another 
schema, each topic is instantiated using standard text generation primitives like elicit and inform. In 
addition to arguments specifying the content, the primitives can be modified with arguments specifying 
where the primitive falls on Halliday's interpersonal nd narrative axes. Thus, for example, a sentence 
like Remember that we're in the pre-neural period could be generated from a form like <T-informs 
info=DR-info attitude=remind>. Optional arguments are also provided for generating several kinds o f  
discourse markers and temporal clauses. 
Instead of planning the complete text as in a monologue, we interleave planning and execution, planning 
only as much as necessary to generate the next turn. When the student gives an unexpected response, 
which includes various kinds of "near-misses" as well as wrong answers, we can choose between retrying 
the current goal, adding a new g0al at the top of the agenda, or dropping the current schema nd 
replacing it by another one. In this way We can reply flexibly to the student while still maintaining a long-
