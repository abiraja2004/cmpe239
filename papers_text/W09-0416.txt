Abstract
In this paper, we describe the machine
translation system in the evaluation cam-
paign of the Fourth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation at EACL 2009.
We describe the modular design of our
multi-engine MT system with particular
focus on the components used in this par-
ticipation.
We participated in the translation task
for the following translation directions:
French?English and English?French, in
which we employed our multi-engine ar-
chitecture to translate. We also partic-
ipated in the system combination task
which was carried out by the MBR de-
coder and Confusion Network decoder.
We report results on the provided devel-
opment and test sets.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we present a multi-engine MT
system developed at DCU, MATREX (Machine
Translation using Examples). This system exploits
EBMT, SMT and system combination techniques
to build a cascaded translation framework.
We participated in both the French?English and
English-French News tasks. In these two tasks,
we employ three individual MT system which are
1) Baseline: phrase-based system (PB); 2) EBMT:
Monolingually chunking both source and target
sides of the dataset using a marker-based chun-
ker (Gough and Way, 2004). 3) HPB: a typical
hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2005).
Meanwhile, we also use a word-level combina-
tion framework (Rosti et al, 2007) to combine the
multiple translation hypotheses and employ a new
rescoring model to generate the final result.
For the system combination task, we first use
the minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) (Kumar and
Byrne, 2004) decoder to select the best hypothe-
sis as the alignment reference for the Confusion
Network (CN) (Mangu et al, 2000). We then build
the CN using the TER metric (Snover et al, 2006),
and finally search and generate the translation.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 details the various components of
our system, in particular the multi-engine strate-
gies used for the shared task. In Section 3, we
outline the complete system setup for the shared
task and provide results on the development and
test sets. Section 4 is our conclusion.
2 The MATREX System
2.1 System Architecture
The MATREX system is a combination-based
multi-engine architecture, which exploits aspects
of both the EBMT and SMT paradigms.
This architecture includes three individual sys-
tems which are phrase-based, example-based and
hierarchical phrase-based.
The combination structure is the MBR decoder
and CN decoder, which is based on the word-level
combination strategy.
In the final stage, we use a new rescoring mod-
ule to process the N -best list generated by the
combination module. See Figure 1 as a detailed
illustration.
2.2 Example-Based Machine Translation
EBMT obtains resources using the Marker Hy-
pothesis (Green, 1979), a psycholinguistic con-
straint which posits that all languages are marked
for surface syntax by a specific closed set of lex-
emes or morphemes which signify context. Given
a set of closed-class words we segment each sen-
tence into chunks, creating a chunk at each new
occurrence of a marker word, with the restriction
that each segment must contain at least one non-
marker word (Gough and Way, 2004).

We then align these segments using an edit-
distance-style algorithm, in which the insertion
and deletion probabilities depend on word-to-
word translation probabilities and word-to-word
cognates (Stroppa and Way, 2006).
We extracted phrases of at most 7 words on
each side. We then merged these phrases with the
phrases extracted by the baseline system adding
word alignment information, and used this system
seeded with this additional information.
2.3 Hierarchical Machine Translation
HPB translation system is a re-implementation of
the hierarchical phrase translation model which is
based on PSCFG (Chiang, 2005). We generate re-
cursively PSCFG rules from the initial rules as
N ? f1 . . . fm/e1 . . . en
where N is a rule which is initial or includes non-
terminals.
M ? fi . . . fj/eu . . . ev
where 1 ? i ? j ? m and 1 ? u ? v ? n, at
which point a new rule can be obtained, named,
N ? f i?11 Xkfmj+1/eu?11 Xkenv+1
where k is an index for the nonterminal X . The
number of nonterminals permitted in a rule is no
more than two.
When extracting hierarchical rules,we set some
limitations that initial rules are of no more than
7 words in length and other rules should have
no more than 5 terminals and nonterminals, and
we disallow rules with adjacent source-side and
target-side nonterminals.
The decoder is an enhanced CYK-style chart
parser that maximizes the derivation probability
and spans up to 12 source words. A 4-gram lan-
guage model generated by SRI Language Model-
ing toolkit (SRILM) (Stolcke, 2002) is used in the
cube-pruning process. The search space is pruned
with a chart cell size limit of 50.
2.4 System Combination
For multiple system combination, we implement
an MBR-CN framework as shown in Figure 1. In-
stead of using a single system output as the skele-
ton, we employ a minimum Bayes-risk decoder
to select the best single system output from the
merged N -best list by minimizing the BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2002) loss.
The confusion network is built by the output of
MBR as the backbone which determines the word
order of the combination. The other hypotheses
are aligned against the backbone based on the TER
metric. NULL words are allowed in the alignment.
Each arc in the CN represents an alternative word
at that position in the sentence and the number of
votes for each word is counted when constructing
the network. The features we used are as follows:
? word posterior probability (Fiscus, 1997);
? 3, 4-gram target language model;
? word length penalty;
? Null word length penalty;
Also, we use MERT (Och, 2003) to tune the
weights of confusion network.
2.5 Rescore
Rescore is a very important part in post-processing
which can select a better hypothesis from the N -
best list. We add some new global features in
rescore model. The features we used are as fol-
lows:
? Direct and inverse IBM model;
? 3, 4-gram target language model;
? 3, 4, 5-gram POS language model (Ratna-
parkhi, 1996; Schmid, 1994);
96
? Sentence length posterior probability (Zens
and Ney, 2006);
? N -gram posterior probabilities within the N -
Best list (Zens and Ney, 2006);
? Minimum Bayes Risk probability;
? Length ratio between source and target sen-
tence;
The weights are optimized via MERT algorithm.
3 Experimental Setup
The following section describes the system and
experimental setup for the French-English and
English-French translation tasks.
3.1 Statistics of Data
Parallel Corpus
We used Europarl and Giga data for this evalua-
tion. The statistics of parallel data are shown in
Table 1.
Corpra Sen Token-En Token-Fr Len
Europarl 1.46M 39,240,672 42,252,067 80
Giga 2M 48,648,104 57,869,002 65
Table 1: Statistics of Parallel Data
In this table, Sen indicates the number of sentence
pairs; Len denotes the maximum sentence length
of each corpus. This year the translation task is
only evaluated on News Domain. Experimental re-
sults showed that giga data is more correlated than
Europarl and the BLEU score is significantly im-
proved(See Table 4).
Monolingual Corpus
In this evaluation, we trained a small 4-gram lan-
guage model using data in Table 1 and a large 4-
gram language model using data in Table 2. We
configured these two LMs for Baseline and EBMT
systems while HPB only used the large one.
Language Sen Token Source
English 9,966,838 240,849,221 E/N/NC
French 9,966,838 260,520,313 E/N/NC
Table 2: Statistics of Monolingual Data
In the above table, E/N/NC refers to Eu-
roparl/News/New Commentary corpus.
3.2 Pre-Processing
We preprocessed both Europarl and Giga Release
1 corpus. For the Europarl corpus, we removed
the reserved characters in GIZA++ and tokenized
and lowercased the corpus with tools provided by
WMT09. The Giga corpus was too large for our
resource, so we performed sentence selection be-
fore cleaning, in the following steps.
? We split the Giga corpus into even segments,
each segment consisting of 20 lines.
? We trained an SVM classifier on English side
with positive examples from the monolin-
gual news data and negative examples from
noisy sentences (numbers, meaningless word
combinations, and random segments) from
the Giga corpus. We used ?-ly? and ?-ing?
to approximate adverbs and present partici-
ples and did not use other POS-induced fea-
tures, as in (Ferizis and Bailey, 2006). We
added these features to remove noise: aver-
age length of sentences, frequency of capital-
ized characters, frequency of numerical char-
acters and short word penalty (equals to 1
when average length of words < 4, and 0
otherwise). We used the classifier to remove
20% segments of lowest scores.
? We selected 1, 600 words having the highest
mutual information scores with monolingual
training data against the Giga corpus.
? We selected 100, 000 segments where these
words occurred most frequently. However
the sentence was dropped if the length ratio
between English and French was larger than
1.5 or less than 0.67.
3.3 System Configuration
The two language models were done using the
SRILM employing linear interpolation and modi-
fied K-N discounting (Chen and Goodman, 1996).
The configuration for the three systems is listed
in Table 3.
System P-Table Length LM Features
Baseline-E 55.9M 7 2 15
Baseline-G 58.4M 7 2 15
EBMT 59.4M 7 2 15
HPB 122M 5 1 8
Table 3: Statistics of MT Systems
In this table, E indicates the Europarl corpus
97
which is used for all three systems, and G stands
for the Giga corpus which is only used for the
Baseline system. We can see from Table 3 that
the size of the HPB phrase-table is more than 2
times as large as the other phrase tables. How to
filter and process such a huge hierarchical table is
a challenging problem.
We tuned our systems on the development set
devset2009-a and devset2009-b, and performed
the crossover experiment by these two devsets.
3.4 Experimental Results
The system output is evaluated with respect to
BLEU score. In Table 4, we used devset2009-b
to tune the various parameters in our three single
systems and devset2009-a for testing. In terms of
the Europarl data, we can see that the three sys-
tems we used achieved similar performance on the
test set for both translation directions, with the
Baseline-E system yielding slightly better results
than the other two.
System Fr-En En-Fr
Baseline-E 22.24 22.68
Baseline-G 24.90 ?1
EBMT 22.04 22.12
HPB 21.69 21.12
MBR 25.11 22.68
CN 25.24 22.76
Rescore 25.40 22.97
Table 4: Experimental Results on Devset2009-a
We then used the translations of the devset2009-
a produced by each system to tune the parame-
ters of our system combination module. From Ta-
ble 4, we can see that using MBR and confusion
network decoding leads to a slight improvement
over the strongest single system, i.e. the baseline
Phrase-Based SMT system. Rescoring the N -best
lists yielded an increase of 0.5 (2.0 relative) ab-
solute BLEU points over the baseline for French?
English Translation and 0.29 (1.28 relative) abso-
lute BLEU points for English?French Translation.
Table 5 is the results on 2009 Test Data. The
scores with a slash in the last two rows are low-
ercased and cased respectively. From the table we
1Not much time to do the experiments on English-French
direction. EBMT and HPB just used the Europarl corpus.
2The official automatic result is scored on 2525 sentences
out of the whole 3007 sentences in test set. The other 502
sentences are used as the development set for combination
evaluation task.
System Fr-En En-Fr
Baseline-E 25.64 24.47
Baseline-G 26.75 ?
EBMT 25.67 24.43
HPB 25.20 24.19
Combination 27.20/25.14 25.26/22.28
Official-Auto2 26.86/24.93 23.78/22.14
Table 5: Summary of Results on 2009 Test Data
can see that combination yielded 0.45 and 0.79 ab-
solute BLEU points over the best single system for
Fr-En and En-Fr direction respectively. However,
1.93 (7.2 relative) and 1.64 (6.58 relative) BLEU
points are dropped between cased and lowercased
results of both directions. Accordingly, training an
effective recasing model is very important for our
future work.
4 Conclusion
This paper presents our machine translation sys-
tem in WMT2009 shared task campaign. We de-
veloped a multi-engine framework which com-
bined the output results of the three MT sys-
tems and generated a new N -best list after CN
decoding. Then by using some global features
the rescoring model generated the final translation
output. The experimental result proved that the
combination module and rescoring module are ef-
fective in our framework.
We also applied simple yet effective methods
of genre and topical classification to remove noise
and out-of-domain sentences in the Giga corpus,
from which we built better translation models than
from Europarl.
In future work, we will refine our system frame-
work to investigate its effect on the tasks pre-
sented here, and we will develop more powerful
post-processing tools such as recaser to reduce the
BLEU loss.
