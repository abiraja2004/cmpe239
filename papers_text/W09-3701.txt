Abstract
A common computational goal is to encapsulate the modeling of a target
phenomenon within a unified and comprehensive ?engine?, which addresses
a broad range of the required processing tasks. This goal is followed in
common modeling of the morphological and syntactic levels of natural lan-
guage, where most processing tasks are encapsulated within morphological
analyzers and syntactic parsers. In this talk I suggest that computational
modeling of the semantic level should also focus on encapsulating the var-
ious processing tasks within a unified module (engine). The input/output
specification of such engine (API) can be based on the textual entailment
paradigm, which will be described in brief and suggested as an attractive
framework for applied semantic inference. The talk will illustrate an initial
proposal for the engine?s API, designed to be embedded within the promi-
nent language processing applications. Finally, I will sketch the entailment
formalism and efficient inference algorithm developed at Bar-Ilan University,
which illustrates a principled transformational (rather than interpretational)
approach towards developing a comprehensive semantic engine.
