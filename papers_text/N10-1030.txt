Abstract
Semantic role labeling (SRL) not only needs
lexical and syntactic information, but also
needs word sense information. However, be-
cause of the lack of corpus annotated with
both word senses and semantic roles, there is
few research on using word sense for SRL.
The release of OntoNotes provides an oppor-
tunity for us to study how to use word sense
for SRL. In this paper, we present some novel
word sense features for SRL and find that they
can improve the performance significantly.
1 Introduction
Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a kind of shallow
sentence-level semantic analysis and is becoming a
hot task in natural language processing. SRL aims at
identifying the relations between the predicates in a
sentence and their associated arguments. At present,
the main stream researches are focusing on feature
engineering or combination of multiple results.
Word senses are important information for rec-
ognizing semantic roles. For example, if we know
?cat? is an ?agent? of the predicate ?eat? in a
sentence, we can guess that ?dog? can also be
an ?agent? of ?eat?. Word sense has been suc-
cessfully used in many natural language process-
ing tasks, such as machine translation (Chan et al,
2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007). CoNLL 2008 shared
task (Surdeanu et al, 2008) first introduced the pred-
icate classification task, which can be regarded as
the predicate sense disambiguation. Meza-Ruiz and
Riedel (2009) has shown that the predicate sense can
improve the final SRL performance. However, there
is few discussion about the concrete influence of all
word senses, i.e. the words besides predicates. The
major reason is lacking the corpus, which is both an-
notated with all word senses and semantic roles.
The release of OntoNotes corpus provides an op-
portunity for us to verify whether all word senses
can help SRL. OntoNotes is a large corpus annotated
with constituency trees (based on Penn Treebank),
predicate argument structures (based on Penn Prop-
Bank) and word senses. It has been used in some
natural language processing tasks, such as joint pars-
ing and named entity recognition (Finkel and Man-
ning, 2009) and word sense disambiguation (Zhong
et al, 2008).
In this paper, we regard the word sense informa-
tion as additional SRL features. We compare three
categories of word sense features (subtree-word re-
lated sense, predicate sense, and sense path) and find
that the subtree-word related sense feature is ineffec-
tive, however, the predicate sense and the sense path
features can improve the SRL performance signifi-
cantly.
2 Data Preparation
In our experiments, we use the OntoNotes Release
2.01 corpus (Hovy et al, 2006). The OntoNotes
project leaders describe it as ?a large, multilingual
richly-annotated corpus constructed at 90% inter-
nanotator agreement.? The corpus has been an-
notated with multiple levels of annotation, includ-
ing constituency trees, predicate argument struc-
ture, word senses, co-reference, and named entities.
For this work, we focus on the constituency trees,
word senses, and predicate argument structures. The
corpus has English and Chinese portions, and we
just use the English portion, which has been split
into seven sections: ABC, CNN, MNB, NBC, PRI,
VOA, and WSJ. These sections represent a mix of
speech and newswire data.
Because we used SRL system based on depen-
dence syntactic trees, we convert the constituency

catalogId=LDC2008T04
246
trees into dependence trees with an Constituent-to-
Dependency Conversion Tool2. In addition, we also
convert the OntoNotes sense of each polysemant
into WordNet sense using sense inventory file pro-
vided by OntoNotes 2.0. For an OntoNotes sense
with more than one WordNet sense, we simply use
the foremost (more popular) one.
3 Semantic Role Labeling System
Our baseline is a state-of-the-art SRL system based
on dependency syntactic tree (Che et al, 2009). A
maximum entropy (Berger et al, 1996) classifier is
used to predict the probabilities of a word in the
sentence to be each semantic role. A virtual role
?NULL? (presenting none of roles is assigned) is
added to the roles set, so it does not need seman-
tic role identification stage anymore. For a predi-
cate, two classifiers (one for noun predicates, and
the other for verb predicates) predict probabilities of
each word in a sentence to be each semantic role (in-
cluding virtual role ?NULL?). The features used in
this stage are listed in Table 1.
Feature Description
FirstwordLemma The lemma of the first word in a
subtree
HeadwordLemma The lemma of the head word in
a subtree
HeadwordPOS The POS of the head word in a
subtree
LastwordLemma The lemma of the last word in a
subtree
POSPath The POS path from a word to a
predicate
PathLength The length of a path
Position The relative position of a word
with a predicate
PredicateLemma The lemma of a predicate
RelationPath The dependency relation path
from a word to a predicate
Table 1: Features that are used in SRL.
4 Word Sense for Semantic Role Labeling
From Table 1, we can see that there are lots of lemma
or POS related features. However, the lemma fea-
ture is very sparse and may result in data sparseness
2http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/treebank converter/
problem. As for the POS, it represents the syntactic
information, but is not enough to distinguish differ-
ent semantic roles. Therefore, we need a kind of new
feature, which is general than the lemma and special
than the POS.
The word sense just satisfies the requirement.
Thus, we will add some new features related with
word sense for SRL. Generally, the original features
can be classified into three categories:
1. Subtree-word related: FirstwordLemma, Last-
wordLemma, HeadwordLemma, and Head-
wordPOS
2. Predicate related: PredicateLemma
3. Word and predicate related: POSPath, Rela-
tionPath, PathLenght, and Position
Correspondingly, we add three categories of word
sense features by replacing Lemma or POS into
Sense, i.e.
1. Subtree-word related sense: FirstwordSense,
LastwordSense, and HeadwordSense
2. Predicate related sense: PredicateSense
3. Word and predicate related sense: SensePath
Three strategies are designed to adopt these
senses:
1. Lemma+Sense: It is the original word
sense representation in OntoNotes, such as
?dog.n.1?. In fact, This is a specialization of
the lemma.
2. Hypernym(n): It is the hypernym of a word
sense, e.g. the hypernym of ?dog.n.1? is ?ca-
nine.n.1?. The n means the level of the hy-
pernym. With the increasing of n, the sense
becomes more and more general. In theory,
however, this strategy may result in inconsis-
tent sense, e.g. word ?dog? and ?canine? have
different hypernyms. The same problem occurs
with Basic Concepts method (Izquierdo et al,
2007).
3. Root Hyper(n): In order to extract more con-
sistent sense, we use the hypernym of a word
sense counting from the root of a sense tree,
e.g. the root hypernym of ?dog.n.1? is ?en-
tity.n.1?. The n means the level of the root hy-
pernym. With the increasing of n, the sense
247
becomes more and more special. Thus, word
?dog? and ?canine? have the same Root Hyper:
?entity?, ?physical entity?, and ?object? with n
= 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
5 Experiments
We will do our experiments on seven of the
OntoNotes English datasets described in Section 2.
For each dataset, we aimed for roughly a 60% train
/ 20% development / 20% test split. See Table 2
for the detailed statistics. In order to examine the
influence of word senses in isolation, we use the hu-
man annotated POS, parse trees, and word senses
provided by OntoNotes. The lemma of each word is
extracted using WordNet tool.

seven datasets in sentences. The file ranges (in parenthe-
sis) refer to the numbers within the names of the original
OntoNotes files.
The baseline SRL system without sense informa-
tion is trained with all the training corpus as de-
scribed in Section 3. Its performance on the devel-
opment data is F1 = 85.48%.
Table 3 shows the performance (F1) comparison
on the development data among different sense ex-
tracting strategies with different feature categories.
The numbers are the parameter n used in Hypernym
and Root Hyper strategies.
From Table 3, we can find that:
1. Both of the predicate sense feature and the
sense path feature can improve the performance. For

Lemma+Sense 85.34% 86.16% 85.69%

the predicate sense feature, we arrive at the same
conclusion with Meza-Ruiz and Riedel (2009). As
for the sense path feature, it is more special than the
POS, therefore, it can enhance the precision.
2. The subtree-word related sense is almost use-
less. The reason is that the original lemma and POS
features have been able to describe the subtree-word
related information. This kind of sense features is
just reduplicate.
3. For different sense feature categories
(columns), the performance is not very seriously af-
fected by different sense extracting strategies (rows).
That is to say, once the sense of a word is disam-
biguated, the sense expressing form is not important
for SRL.
In order to further improve the performance,
we add the predicate sense and the sense path
features simultaneously. Here, we select the
Lemma+Sense strategy for the predicate sense and
the Root Hyper(1) strategy for the sense path. The
final performance achieves F1 = 86.44%, which is
about 1% higher than the baseline (F1 = 85.48%).
Finally, we compare the baseline (without sense)
result with the word sense result on the test data. In
order to see the contribution of correct word senses,
we introduce a simple sense determining strategy,
which use the first (the most popular)WordNet sense
for each word. The final detailed comparison results
are listed in Table 4.
Averagely, both of the methods with the first sense
and the correct sense can perform better than the
baseline. However, the improvement of the method
with the first sense is not significant (?2-test3 with

? < 0.01). Especially, for some sections, such as
ABC and MNB, it is harmful to the performance. In
contrast, the correct word sense can improve the per-
formance significantly (?2-test with ? < 0.01)and
consistently. These can further prove that the word
sense can enhance the semantic role labeling.
6 Conclusion
This is the first effort to adopt the word sense
features into semantic role labeling. Experiments
show that the subtree-word related sense features
are ineffective, but the predicate sense and the sense
path features can improve the performance signifi-
cantly. In the future, we will use an automatic word
sense disambiguation (WSD) system to obtain word
senses and study the function of WSD for SRL.
