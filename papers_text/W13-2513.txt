Abstract
Multilingual sentiment analysis attracts in-
creased attention as the massive growth
of multilingual web contents. This con-
ducts to study opinions across different
languages by comparing the underlying
messages written by different people hav-
ing different opinions. In this paper, we
propose Sentiment based Comparability
Measures (SCM) to compare opinions in
multilingual comparable articles without
translating source/target into the same lan-
guage. This will allow media trackers
(journalists) to automatically detect public
opinion split across huge multilingual web
contents. To develop SCM, we need either
to get or to build parallel sentiment cor-
pora. Because this kind of corpora are not
available, we decided to build them. For
that, we propose a new method to automat-
ically label parallel corpora with sentiment
classes. Then we use the extracted parallel
sentiment corpora to develop multilingual
sentiment analysis system. Experimental
results show that, the proposed measure
can capture differences in terms of opin-
ions. The results also show that compara-
ble articles variate in their objectivity and
positivity.
1 Introduction
We can distinguish two kinds of sentiments anal-
ysis depending on monolingual or multilingual ar-
ticles.
In the following, as in (Pang and Lee, 2008), the
terms Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Opinion Min-
ing (OM) are used as synonyms. Mining opinions
is to identify the subjectivity and/or the polarity of
a given text at article or sentence level. Subjectiv-
ity identification is to classify the text into subjec-
tive or objective, while polarity identification is to
classify the text into negative or positive.
Popular methods for monolingual sentiment
analysis are based on lexicon and corpus. Lexi-
con based methods use string matching techniques
between texts and annotated lexicons. The most
common sentiment lexicons for English language
are WordNet-Affect (Valitutti, 2004) and Senti-
WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), which are
extensions of WordNet. Additionally, SenticNet
(Cambria et al, 2010) is a knowledge-base ex-
tension of aforementioned lexicons. On the other
hand, corpus based approach is popular for sen-
timent analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008). It uses
corpora and machine learning algorithms to build
sentiment classification systems. For example,
Pang et al used polarity (Pang et al, 2002) and
subjectivity (Pang and Lee, 2004) English cor-
pora to train machine learning algorithms to build
sentiment classifiers. These resources have been
adapted to other languages by many researchers
as we will see in the following.
Multilingual sentiments analysis becomes a re-
ality because of the massive growth of multilin-
gual web contents. In this case, sentiment analy-
sis identifies sentiments across multiple languages
instead of one language. This can be done by
creating sentiment resources for new languages
by translating existing English resources (lexi-
cons/corpora) into the target language, or by trans-
lating target text into English, then pass the trans-
lated text to English models for sentiment analysis
(Rushdi-Saleh et al, 2011; Bautin et al, 2008; De-
necke, 2008; Ghorbel, 2012). However, (Brooke
et al, 2009) reported that creating new resources
to build sentiment models from scratch works bet-
ter than using the approach based on machine
translation.
As we see in the previous discussion, works on
multilingual sentiment analysis just try to iden-
tify sentiments across multiple languages. How-
105
ever, it is worthy to compare opinions about a
given topic in several languages, not just to iden-
tify these opinions. If people from different cul-
tures wrote an article about political/societal top-
ics, they may judge these topics differently ac-
cording to their cultures. In fact, detecting dis-
agreement of opinions in multiple languages is a
promising research area. So, our goal is to en-
able media trackers (journalists) to automatically
detect the split of public opinions about a given
topic across multiple languages. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no work in the literature that
serve our goal, therefore, we propose to develop
automatic measures that compare opinions in mul-
tilingual comparable articles. These comparabil-
ity measures will be the core of our goal which is
building multilingual automatic journalist review
system.
For that, we propose a Sentiment based Com-
parability Measures (SCM) which identify senti-
ments, score them and compare them across mul-
tilingual documents. Therefore, we need to iden-
tify and score sentiments in multiple languages.
Namely, SCM needs a multilingual sentiment
analysis system to identify and score sentiments.
To build this system, we need parallel sentiment
corpora from different topics. Unfortunately, we
do not have such corpora, we only have English
sentiment corpus. So, we propose in Section 2 a
new method to build parallel sentiment corpora.
We start from English sentiment corpora (movie
reviews domain), then use it to build sentiment
classifier for English language and then label a
new parallel English/target corpora which is dif-
ferent from the movie one. In section 3, we use the
obtained parallel sentiment corpora to build a mul-
tilingual sentiment analysis system which is used
to develop SCM, then we use SCM to compare
multilingual comparable articles in terms of opin-
ions. The advantage of this idea is that we do not
need to translate corpora/lexicons to analyse mul-
tilingual text.
The rest of this article is organized as fol-
lows, Section 2 describes our method to build par-
allel sentiment corpora, Section 3 presents our
proposed sentiment based comparability measures
(SCM) and experimental results conducted on cor-
pora. Finally, we state the conclusions.
2 Sentiment Corpora Extraction
As we introduced earlier, we need parallel cor-
pora to build the sentiment comparability measure.
Therefore, we present in this section a method
to annotate parallel corpora with sentiment la-
bels. This method can be applied on any En-
glish/target language pairs. In this work, we la-
bel English/Arabic parallel sentences. The idea is
to use an English sentiment classifier to label each
English sentence in the new parallel corpora, then
we can assign the same label to the target (Ara-
bic) sentence, because sentences are parallel and
convey the same opinions.
The widely used approach to build a classifier
is to build a Naive Bayes model using n-grams
linguistic features (Pang et al, 2002; Dave et al,
2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004;
Cui et al, 2006; Tan et al, 2009). So, we use this
method on bigrams extracted from English sen-
timent corpora of movie reviews. These corpora
are manually labelled with subjectivity and polar-
ity labels. Each review in the collection is rep-
resented as a vector composed of bigram occur-
rences. Then, each vector is feed to Naive Bayes
classifier with corresponding class label for train-
ing. Naive Bayes classifies the vector to the high-
est probable class. Our objective in this paper is to
compare opinions, this is why we used this tradi-
tional method for building the sentiment classifier.
The parallel corpora, that we annotate, cover
variant topics (newspapers, UN resolutions, and
transcribed talks), and are available in many lan-
guages. The newspapers are collection of parallel
articles from AFP, ANN, ASB, and provided by
LDC1. UN corpora2 is a collection of United Na-
tions General Assembly Resolutions. Transcribed
talks are collection of multilingual transcriptions
from TED provided by WIT33.
Figure 1 illustrates our method and Table 1 de-
scribes corpora denoted in the figure. The men-
tioned corpora are: senti-corp, parallel, and new-
senti-corp. senti-corp represents the monolingual
(English) manually labelled, parallel represents
parallel corpora in variant topics, and new-senti-
corp represents the extracted corpora. Corpora
sizes are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2
presents the number of reviews of senti-corp with

The following steps describe the method we
propose:
1. Split senti-corp into two parts: senti-corp-p1
is 90%, and senti-corp-p2 is 10%.
2. Use senti-corp-p1 to train a Naive Bayes
classifier to build a monolingual sentiment
model.
3. Split the parallel corpora into two parts:
parallel-p1 is 90%, and parallel-p2 is 10%.
4. Using the sentiment classification model ob-
tained in step 2, classify and label English
sentences of parallel-p1 and assign the same
sentiment class to the corresponding Arabic
sentences.
5. Refine and filter sentences which are labelled
in step 4. The filtering process keeps only
sentences that have high sentiment score.
Then, we obtain new-senti-corp which is
Arabic/English parallel sentiment labelled
corpora in different domains.
6. Use the English part of new-senti-corp which
is obtained in step 5 to train a Naive Bayes
classifier.
7. Evaluate the classifier built in step 6 on senti-
corp-p2. If the classification accuracy is ac-
cepted, then continues, otherwise, try other
corpora and/or models.
This method is independent of the the sentiment
class labels. So, it can be applied for subjectivity
or polarity corpus.
Tables 4 and 5 present the experimental results
of steps 4 and 5 of the Figure 1. Table 4 shows
the statistical information of sentiment scores of
the labelled corpora, where Rate is the class label
distribution (percentage) with respect to the whole
dataset. ?, ?, Min, and Max are the mean, stan-
dard deviation, minimum, and maximum values
of sentiment scores respectively. For subjectiv-
ity labels, 54% and 46% of sentences are labelled
as subjective and objective respectively. For po-
larity labels, 58% and 42% of sentences are la-
belled as negative and positive respectively. Table
5 presents the frequency table of intervals of sen-
timent scores of the labelled sentences. We can
see from Table 5 that most of sentences have high
sentiment scores (from 0.9 to 1.0). To extract high
quality labelled sentences, we keep only sentences
with score greater than 0.8.
In order to evaluate the quality of the extracted
corpora (step 7 in Figure 1), we need first to build a
sentiment classifier based on this corpora and then
evaluate the accuracy of this classifier. The detail
of this process is given bellow:
1. Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the parallel
sentiment corpora new-senti-corp.
2. Test the obtained classifiers on the manually
labelled corpus senti-corp-p2.

In the following, senti-corp-p2 is the test cor-
pus. The evaluation is presented in Table 6.
The metrics include classification accuracy, and
F-measures. F-neg, F-pos, F-sub, and F-obj are
the F-measures for negative, positive, subjective,
and objective classes respectively. For subjectiv-

ity test, the classifier achieved 76.5% of accuracy
and an average of 75.8% of f-measure. For polar-
ity test, the classifier leads to 72% of accuracy and
an average of 71% of F-measure.
We wanted to compare these results with oth-
ers works in sentiment classification, but unfortu-
nately the used corpora are not the same. Anyway,
these results are only indicative for us, because our
objective is not to propose a new method for auto-
matic sentiment classification, but to build a senti-
ment based comparability measure.
Now, we obtained English/Arabic parallel sen-
timent corpora in multiple topics. We use these
corpora to develop sentiment based comparability
measures that will be described in the next section.
Notice that at the beginning the only avail-
able sentiment corpus was a collection of movie
reviews in English language, with the proposed
method, we got multilingual sentiment corpora
of different topics. Furthermore, using this
method, one can obtain sentiment corpus for
under-resourced languages. The advantage of the
parallel corpora is to build sentiment classifiers
that can be used to develop sentiment based com-
parability measures.
3 Sentiment Based Comparability
Measures
As we stated in the introduction, there are no work
in the literature that serve our goal, which is to
compare multilingual articles in terms opinions.
Therefore, we propose to develop automatic mea-
sures that compare opinions in multilingual com-
parable articles.
In the previous section, we built a parallel sen-
timent corpora where both source and its corre-
sponding sentence have the same sentiment label.
In this section, we compare multilingual compa-
rable articles in terms of sentiments. Obviously,
in this case we do not have the same sentiment la-
bels since articles are comparable and not parallel.
So, we develop Sentiment based Comparability
Measures (SCM) which measure the differences
of opinions in multilingual corpora. For that, we
use the achieved parallel sentiment corpora new-
senti-corp to build multilingual sentiment analysis
systems, using the same method as in Section 2.
The idea is to identify and score sentiments in
the source and target comparable articles and pro-
vide these information to SCM to compare their
opinions. In the following, we describe how to
compute SCM for comparable articles based on
average score of all sentences.
We use formula 1 which is derived from Naive
Bayes to compute opinion score and assign the
corresponding label:
classify(S) = argmax
c
P (c)
n?
k=1
P (fk|c) (1)
where S is a sentence, fk are the features of S,
c ? {o, o?} for subjectivity and c ? {p, p?} for po-
larity, where o is objective, o? is subjective, p is
positive, p? is negative.
An article may contain some sentences belong-
ing to the subjective class, and others belonging
to the objective class (idem for positive and nega-
tive). So, for a given pair of comparable articles,
SCM has three parameters dx, dy, c, where dx, dy
are the source and the target articles respectively,
and c is the class label. This score is calculated as
follows:
SCM(dx, dy, c) =
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
C(Sx)=c
P (Sx|c)
Nx
?
?
C(Sy)=c
P (Sy|c)
Ny
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
(2)
Where Sx ? dx, Sy ? dy, and
?
C(Sx)=c
P (Sx|c)
and
?
C(Sy)=c
P (Sy|c) are the sum of probabilities
for all source and target sentences respectively that
belong to class c. Nx and Ny are the number of
source and target sentences respectively that be-
long to the class c. Formally speaking, for a given
pair of documents dx, dy, we have four measures:
SCM(dx, dy, o), SCM(dx, dy, o?) for subjectiv-
ity, and SCM(dx, dy, p), SCM(dx, dy, p?) for po-
larity.
In our experiments, we calculate SCM for pair
of articles in parallel and comparable corpora.
Calculating SCM for parallel corpora could be
very surprising, but we did it in order to show
that for this kind of corpora, the proposed measure
should be better than the one achieved for compa-
rable corpora.

The comparable corpora that we use for our
experiments are AFEWC and eNews which were
collected and aligned at article level (Saad et al,
2013). Each pair of comparable articles is related
to the same topic. AFEWC corpus is collected
from Wikipedia and eNews is collected from Eu-
ronews website. Table 7 presents the number of
articles, sentences, average sentences per article,
average words per article, words, and vocabulary
of these corpora.
Table 8 presents the experimental results of
SCM computed using formula 2. SCM is com-
puted for the source and target articles for par-
allel corpora parallel-p2 and comparable corpora
(AFEWC and eNews). We note that SCM for AFP,
ANN, ASB, TED, and UN corpora are small be-
cause they are parallel. This shows that the pro-
posed measure is well adapted to capture the sim-
ilarity between parallel articles. Indeed, they have
the same sentiments. On the other hand, SCM be-
come larger for comparable corpora, because the
concerned articles do not necessary have the same
sentiments. The only exception to what have been
claimed is that the subjectivity SCM for eNews
comparable corpora is similar to the one of ASB
which is parallel corpora. In contrast, the objec-
tivity SCM is larger (0.15) for eNews, that means
pair of articles in eNews corpora have similar sub-
jective but different objective sentiments. In other
words, source and target are considered similar in
terms of subjectivity but different in terms of ob-
jectivity (idem for negative and positive). Con-
sequently, comparable articles do not necessary
have the same opinions. Additionally, we note
that the SCM for AFEWC corpora are the largest
in comparison to the others, this is maybe because
Wikipedia has been written by many different con-
tributors from different cultures.
4 Conclusions
We presented a new method for comparing mul-
tilingual sentiments through comparable articles
without the need of translating source/target arti-
cles into the same language. Our results showed
that it is possible now for media trackers to au-
tomatically detect difference in public opinions
across huge multilingual web contents. The re-
sults showed that the comparable articles variate
in their objectivity and positivity. To develop our
system, we required parallel sentiment corpora.
So, we presented in this paper an original method
to build parallel sentiment corpora. We started
from an English movie corpus annotated in terms
of sentiments, we trained NB classier to classify
an English text concerning topics different from
movie, and then we deduced the sentiment labels
of the the corresponding target parallel text by as-
signing the same labels. This method is interest-
110
ing because it allows us to produce several parallel
sentiment corpora concerning different topics. We
built SCM using these parallel sentiment corpora,
then, SCM identifies sentiments, scores them and
compares them across multilingual documents. In
the future works, we will elaborate our journalist
review system by developing a multilingual com-
parability measure that can handle semantics and
integrate it with the sentiment based measure.
