ABSTRACT 
A cent ra l  p rob lem in speech  synthes is  w i th  unre -  
s t r i c ted  vocabu lary  is the  automat ic  der ivat ion  of 
cor rec t  p ronunc ia t ion  from the graphemic  form of a 
text .  The so f tware  module GRAPHON was deve loped  to 
per fo rm th i s  convers ion  for  German and  is cur rent ly  
be ing  extended by a morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  compo-  
nent .  Th is  ana lys i s  is based  on a morph lexicon and 
a sot  of ru le~ and  s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions  for  German 
word- fo rms.  I t  p rov ides  each text  input  i tem wi th  an 
ind iv idua l  character i za t ion  such  that  the  phonological~ 
syntact i c ,  and  prosod ic  components  may operate  upon  
it. Th is  sys temat ic  approach  tht~s serves  to minimize 
the  number  of wrong  t ranscr ip t ions  and  a t  the  same 
time lays  the  foundat ion  for  the  generat ion  of s t ress  
and  in tonat ion  pat terns ,  y ie ld ing  more inte l l ig ib le~ 
natura l - sound ing ,  and  genera l ly  acceptab le  synthet i c

1. INTRODUCTION 
Many app l i ca t ions  of computer  speech  requ i re  unre -  
s t r i c ted  vocabu lary .  In  par t icu lar~ voice output  un i t s  
of th i s  k ind  permi t  the  l inkage  of the  common te le -  
phone  network  to a cent ra l  computer ,  thus  enab l ing  
access  for  a la rge  publ ic .  "Kar lchen" ,  the  F rank fur t  
ta lk ing  ra i lway  t imetab le ,  and  o ther  automat ic  in fo r -  
mat ion serv ices  a re  based  on th i s  p r inc ip le .  
I f  a wr i t ten  text  serves  as  input  to a speech  syn-  
thes i s  sys tem wi th  unres t r i c ted  vocabu lary  ( text - to -  
speech  synthes is )p  the  der ivat ion  of a cor rec t  and 
natura l - sound ing  pronunc ia t ion  and  in tonat ion  must  
be prov ided  for.  The so f tware  module GRAPHON 
(GRAPHemo-PHONome-conversion) has  boon deve loped  
to conver t  any  g iven  German text  in to  i ts  phonet ic  
t ranscr ip t ion  (I.P.A.)~ enr iched  by some prosod ic  
markers .  
The text - to -speech  sys tem is be ing  implemented  on 
an HP 9816 works ta t ion  sys tem wi th  a 68000 CPU and  
768 kbyte  of RAM. At p resent  a SSI 263 phone  syn-  
thes izer  serves  as  acoust i ca l  output  unit ;  a s impl i f ied  
a r t i cu la tory  model used  to cont ro l  a re f ined  d ig i ta l  
voca l  t rac t  synthes izer  is under  deve lopment .  The 
so f tware  is wr i t ten  in PASCAL and  operat ion  of the  
whole sys tem is expected  to be a lmost  rea l - t ime.  (For 
fu r ther  imp lementat iona l  deta i l s  cf. \[1\].) 
While text - to -speech  sys tems for  the  Eng l i sh  lan -  
guage  are  fa i r l y  advanced ,  there  is much room for  
deve lopment  for  German ~peak ing  sys tems.  I t  is  pos -  
s ib le  on ly  to a l imited extent  to p ro f i t  from work  in 
the  f ie ld of Eng l i sh .  Obv ious ly j  German pronunc ia t ion  
ru les  d i f fe r  from those  of o ther  languages ;  however9 
the  mere rep lacement  of a g iven  grapheme- to -pho-  
neme convers ion  ru le  by another  is inadequate  to 
meet the  demands  of the  very  d i f fe rent  p r inc ip les  on 
which  two wr i t ing -sys tems are  founded.  Ti l ls a lso 
app l ies  to the  s t ruc tura l  leve ls  of morpho logy  and 
syntax .  
2. MOTIVATION FOR A MORPHOIA)GICAL COMPONENT 
The app l i ca t ion  of an  Eng l i sh  pronunc ia t ion  ru le  is 
lexically determined, that is to say, is restricted to a 
generally arbitrary subset of the lexicon (compare~ 
for example, the values of (eaY in the sets 4bread, 
head, thread...~ and {kneads bead, heat..,} ). I t  is  for  
th i s  reason  that  many  Eng l i sh -based  sys tems inc lude  
very  extens ive  d ic t ionar ies ,  for  example the p ioneer -  
ing  work  of Al len \[2\] w i th  a 12000 morpheme lexicon. 
On the  o ther  hand,  German ru les  have  in genera l  a 
much w ider  scope  of app l i ca t ion ,  wh ich  has  led re -  
searchers  work ing  in the f ie ld of German to cons ider  
la rge  lexical  inventor ies  unnecessary .  The inventor ies  
in  e.g.  SAMT \[3\] or  SPRAUS-VS \[4\] a re  thus  re -  
s t r i c ted  to funct ion  words  needed for  the  syntact i c  
ana lys i s  (p repos i t ions ,  p ronouns ,  a r t i c les ,  etc.) .  
S imi lar ly ,  our  ear l ies t  e f fo r ts  in th i s  a rea  were  based 
263 
on a small lexicon and an extens ive  rule catalogue; 
howeverp numerous  incor rect  t ranscr ip t ions  at  mor-  
phological boundar ies  and the f requent  recur rence  to 
ad-hoc  ru les  (of. \[1\]) made the lack of some sor t  of 
morphological  ind icator  apparent .  
However more closely German spel l ing may ref lect  
p ronunc ia t ion  than is the case in Englishp dif f icult ies 
ar ise  in p roduc ing  a cor rect  p ronunc ia t ion  auto -  
matically if knowledge available to the human 
speaker ,  such  as the in terna l  s t ruc ture  of a g iven 
word or  its nat ive as opposed to fore ign or ig in,  is 
not made use  of. The following examples should  
suf f ice to demonst ra te  the re lat ionsh ip  between 
morphology and the va lues  of the wr i t ten  symbols:  
- One fundamenta l  rule is that  vocalic quant i ty  is 
determined by  the number  of fol lowing consonants :  
the f i r s t  rule g iven in the DUDEN Aussprache-  
wSr terbuch  \[5\] s ta tes  that  <a) is to be pronounced 
/a : /  when followed by only one consonant  grapheme 
before the stem boundary ,  so that  the inf lect ional 
form fast  of the verb  rasen  ( " rush" )  becomes 
/ ra :s t /~ whereas  the simplex noun Rast ( " res t " )  
becomes / fas t / .  
- Consonant  or  vowel g roups  may be ass igned 
d igraph  or t r ig raph  value only when they  appear  
within morphological  boundar ies ;  compare for  
example the d i f fe rent  va lues  of <sch> in 15schen 
/ f /  ( "ext ingu ish")  und HiSschen / sq /  (dim. of 
"pants" ) ,  or  of <ei> in Geier /a i /  ( "vu l tu re" )  and 
geirrt /a l  i /  ( "e r red" ) .  
- The f i r s t  stem syl lable in German (native stock) 
rece ives  the pr imary  word s t ress j  a rule which 
implies th is  stemJs being identif iable; compare 
geben / 'ge :bn /  ("g ive")  and Gebein /ga 'ba in /  
( "bones ' ) .  
Those phenomena play a role in the domain of der iv -  
ation and inflection~ which has been dealt with in 
severa l  systemst  e.g. SYNTEX \[6\] or  REDE \[7\]; these  
do contain l ists  of common pref ixes  and suf f ixes to 
permit  a f f ix -st r ipp ing~ a l though they  are pre -  
dominantly ru le -based .  The same prob lems are found 
in the field of composit ion; their  import  is he ightened 
by the very  great  f requency  of th is  p rocess  in the 
German language.  Still, Riihl \[6\] p roposes  a decom- 
posit ion a lgor i thm which rel ies on d is t r ibut iona l  
cr i ter ia  and on l ists  of consonant  c lus ters  in initial 
264 
and final posit ion (based on K6stner  \[8\]). Other  
authors  too pre fer  to minimize the lexical component:  
"The at tempt  to incorporate  th is  problem into a 
mainly ru le -based  sys tem seemed to us  to requ i re  a 
ra ther  g reat  and thus  undes i red  s tep  towards  a kind 
of d ict ionary approach"  (\[9\]~ p.226). 
It  is however  certa in ly  poss ib le  to make a case for a 
morphological  ana lys is  conta in ing a morph- lex icon of 
some depth.  The convers ion  program presented  here  
makes extens ive  use  of such an ana lys is  component  
(see fig. 1) and thus  in our  opinion pro f i t s  from the 
fol lowing advantages :  
inflection~ derivation~ and composit ion can be 
t reated s imul taneous ly ,  more economically, and with 
a reduced number  of incor rect  segmentat ions ;  th is  
la t ter  i s  ach ieved by spec i fy ing  the respect ive  
env i ronments  of potent ia l  elements; 
- simple and eff ic ient t reatment  of exceptions~ for  
ins tance  the pronunc ia t ion  of fo re ign  words;  th is  
and the preced ing  resu l t  in a reduced t ranscr ip -  
t ion er ror  rate  and in simplif ied and more t rans -  
parent  g rapheme- to -phoneme convers ion  ru les;  
cor rec t  placement of word- in terna l  boundar ies j  
label l ing of the const i tuents  and the lexieally 
s tored  information concern ing  nat ive vs.  fo re ign  
s ta tus  favour  accurate  word s t ress  ass ignment ;  
the lex icon-based approach  prepares  the ground 
for  word c lassi f icat ion and extract ion of cer ta in  
syntact ic  const ra in ts ,  p rov id ing  the input  for  an 
e lementary  sentence  parser .

3. SKETCH OF THE MOHPHOIX)GICAL OOMPONENT 
3.1. Lexieal  l :nventory  
Morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  in  our  sys tem re l ies  on a 
s ing le  lexicon ra ther  than  on separate  l i s t s  of, say,  
p re f ixes ,  stems, j unctures  etc. The ent r ies  in th i s  
lex icon are  morphs  and  not  morphemes  in that  stem 
var ia t ion ,  i.e. p rocesses  such  as umlaut  (e.g. Apfe l  - 
~pfe l  "app le" ) ,  ab laut  ( lau? - l ie? " run" )  and  
e -de le t ion  ( t rocken  - t rockn-  "dry" )  a re  not  covered  
by  ru le  but  by  s to rage  of a l lomorphs .  As we are  not 
concerned  wi th  generat ion ,  th i s  appears  to be the  
most p ract i ca l  method.  Forms that  a re  in some way 
i r regu lar  a re  then  natura l ly  p rov ided  with ind iv idua l  
ent r ies ,  for  example anomalous  verb  forms (se in  - bin 
- war  - w~r - ... "be")  or forms of the  de f in i te  
a r t i c le  (dot ,  die,  das,  dem, . . . ) .  We have  chosen  to set  
up the  most bas ic  forms wherever  poss ib le ,  e.g. NAM- 
as  opposed  to NAME (nominat ive  s ingu lar ) ,  wh ich  
permi ts  an  economical  t reatment  of der ivat ion  and 
in f lect ion .  AE~ a mat ter  of fact ,  the  over r id ing  
pr inc ip le  gow~rn ing  the  dec is ion  what  exact ly  shou ld  
const i tu te  an ent ry  is  a p ragmat ic  one: for  example,  
ra ther  than  tak ing  s ides  on l ingu is t i c ,  h i s to r i ca l ,  or  
psycho log ica l  g rounds  in such  cont rovers ia l  cases  as 
antwor t -  vs .  ant  + worL-  ( "answer" ) ,  h imbeer -  vs.  
h im + beer -  ( " raspber ry" ) ,  or  ver l ie~ vs.  ver  + l ie r -  
("lose")~ we choose  the so lu t ion  favour ing  the idea l  
funct ion ing  ot' the  sys tem as  a whole. 
3.1.1. S t ruc ture  of a D ic t ionary  Ent ry  
A d ic t ionary  ent ry  cons is ts  of the  lemma, i.e. 
g raphemic  representat ion  of the  morph,  on the one 
hand and  an in fo rmat ion - t ree ,  serv ing  to character i ze  
i t s  phono log ica l ,  morpho log ica l  and  syntact i c  va lue  on 
the  o ther .  
A number  of p rac t i ca l  convent ions  has  been  set  up 
for  the  form of the  lemma: a g iven  morph is repre -  
sented  by  a maximum of ten  lower -case  le t te rs  ; the  
d iacr i t i c  s ign  " (umlaut)  is made use  of (cf. o ther  
sys tems wh ich  decompose the  vowels  in quest ion  as  
<ae),<oe>,<ue>); l i kewise ,  the  s ign  <D> is not  rep laced  
by  <ss> e i ther  in  the  input  text  or  in the lexicon.  An 
or thograph ic  ~ule of German s ta tes  that  <ss> becomes 
</\]> before  a consonant  or  a word -boundary ,  so that  
the  la t te r  s ign 's  usua l  funct ion  as  an ind icator  of 
vowel  length  is neut ra l i zed  in these  pos i t ions  
(compare Fl f iaae " r ivers"  vs .  F/,De " feet"  wi th FluI3 
( /tr /)  vs .  FuB ( /u : / ) ) ;  th i s  "de fect "  (cf. \[10\]) p.108) 
can  be got  round by mainta in ing  the  oppos i t ion  be-  
tween <ss> and <~> in the  lemma. 
The information-tree contains classificatory data  
per ta in ing  to the  morph i t se l f  and  to those  it  may 
immediate ly  se lect ;  they  concern  morpho log ica l  s ta tus  
( lex ica l  s tem - par t i c le  - der ivat iona l  morph 
in f lec t iona l  morph - juncture  -.. .),  nat ive  or  fo re ign  
s ta tus ,  and combinator ia l  res t r i c t ions .  In  add i t ion ,  the  
lexicon a l lows the in t roduct ion  of in fo rmat ion  for  the 
ass ignment  to par ts  of speech  and,  wherever  neces -  
sary ,  ind icat ions  as to except iona l  p ronunc ia t ion  or  
s t ress  pat tern .  
3.1.2. Extent  of the  Lexical  Inventory  
At p resent  the  lex ica l  inventory  compr ises  some 2000 
ent r ies ,  the  choice of which was based  on 
Or tmann \[11\],  i t se l f  compi led from four  f requency  
l i s ts .  As for  the  contents  of the ent r ies ,  we re l ied  on 
Augst  \[12\], Mater \[13\], and Wahr ig  \[14\]. For the 
ongo ing  tes t ing ,  revie~ion~ and supp lement ing  of th i s  
p r imary  l i s t  we depend on the  f requency  l i s t  in 
Meier \[15\] as well  as  on sample texts  from var ious  
random sources .  Inasmuch as af f ixes,  par t i c les ,  and 
junctures  (at leas t  nat ive  ones)  const i tu te  c losed 
c lasses ,  they  shou ld  be represented  exhaust ive ly  in 
the  inventory .  This  is un for tunate ly  not the  case  as 
soon as  one turns  to fo re ign  e lements ,  to whose 
number  a re  a lways  be ing  added new cand idates .  
Moreover ,  i t  is  very  d i f f i cu l t  if not  imposs ib le  to 
es tab l i sh  genera l  p r inc ip les  accord ing  to which  
fo re ign  su f f i xes  in par t i cu la r  may be i so la ted  and  the 
d iv id ing  l ine found between stem and suff ix .  
P roper  nouns  are  represented  on ly  to a very  l imited 
extent ;  the i r  range  shou ld  be adapted  to the  requ i re -  
ments  of the  task  at  hand.  In  fact ,  the  compi lat ion of 
the  inventory  has  been car r ied  out  w i th  the  aims of 
expandab i l i ty  and  maximum f lex ib i l i ty .  
I t  ts of course  not to be expected  that  the  lexicon 
would ever  cover  the  ent i re  vocabu lary  of a nat ive  
speaker ,  nor  is that  our  in tent ion ;  consequent ly ,  we 
fo resee  a " joker  raorph" which  can s tand  for any  
stem that  may happen to occur .  Th is  is made poss ib le  
265 
by the  genera l i za t ion  that  a German stem conforms to 
a number  of s t ruc tura l  p r inc ip les :  for  example,  every  
stem must  conta in  a vowel  and  the  var ie ty  of con-  
sonant  c lus ters  in in i t ia l ,  medial,  and f ina l  pos i t ion  is  
res t r i c ted  (of. \[8\]).  An oven more genera l  canon ica l  
descr ip t ion  can be exp le i ted  in the  case  of fo re ign  
e lements .  Such a dev ice  has  not yet  been  
implemented.  
For the  t ime be ing ,  64 kbyte  have  been  reserved  to 
accomodate  the  loxieal  inventory .  Note that  al l  loxical  
data  as  descr ibed  above  are  coded so as  to ach ieve  
maximum storage  e f f i c iency .  
3.2. Word Parser  
The segmentat ion  of a g iven  (complex) word  is  
car r ied  cut  automat ica l ly  in a ser ies  of s teps ;  the  
process  is bound from the  very  f i r s t  of these  to the  
d ic t ionary ,  as  s ta ted  above.  Jus t  as  the  human 
speaker  seeks  fami l iar  un i t s  in h is  ident i f i ca t ion  of a 
werd,  the  automat ic  ana lys i s  cons iders  for  fu r ther  
a t tent ion  on ly  those  segment~ which  cor respond to 
forms ava i lab le  in the  lexicon, such  that  the  segments  
a re  cont iguous  and  no le t te rs  a re  le f t  unaccounted  
for.  Thus  a segmentat ion  such  as  mein  + un  + g for  
Meinung ( "op in ion")  could  not be produced  in the  
f i r s t  p lace,  as  +g+ has  no representat ion  in the  
lexicon. The number  of petent la l  ana lyses  is fu r ther  
reduced  by the  fact  that  no boundar ies  a re  searched  
for  in a word cor respond ing  ident ica l ly  to a s ing le  
un i t  in the  lexicon,  for  example der  would not be 
ana lyzed  as  d + or  or  d + o + r . For reasons  of 
run - t ime e f f i c iency ,  a s t ra tegy  is  used  which  
"pre fers"  the  longest  segments ,  s ta r t ing  from the  
beg inn ing  of a g iven  word;  thus  deck  + on  ( "cover" )  
would be the  f i r s t  segmentat ion  proposed  be fore  
d + eck  + on.  The use fu lness  of th i s  p r inc ip le  can  be 
seen  from an example l ike E int r i t t  ( "ent rance" ) ,  
where  the order  of segmentat ions  would be: s in  + 
t r i t t ,  s in  + t + r i f t ,  e i  + n + t r i t t ,  e i  + n + t + f l i t ,  
e + in  + t r i t t ,  e + in  + t + r i f t ,  e + i + n + t r i t t ,  
e + i + n + t + r i f t .  The f i r s t  dec is ion  proposed  by  
the  parser  can be proved  to be the  cor rec t  one in 
the  overwhe lming  major i ty  of cases ,  wh ich  a l lows us  
to de lay  requ i r ing  a second proposa l  unt i l  the  f i r s t  
has  been  re jec ted  on s t ruc tura l  g rounds  in the  fo l lo-  
w ing  s tep  of the  ana lys i s  p rocedure .  
266 
In  th i s  second s tep  the  proposed  segmentat ions  a re  
examined as to the i r  conformi ty  to the  pr inc ip les  of 
German morpho log ica l  s t ruc ture .  The fo l lowing s t ruc -  
tu ra l  formula descr ibes  every  German word,  whether  
of nat ive  or  fo re ign  er ig in :

(e. g. +ese in  Bm~desbEdm "nat iona l  ra i lway" )  
The segmentat ion  is ass igned  a s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ion  
by  match ing  the  combinator ia l  features  of each  un i t  
wi th  the morph s ta tus  in fo rmat ion  of i ts  ne ighbour  as  
g iven  in the  respect ive  lex icon ent r ies .  A morph may 
be spec i f ied  accord ing  to the  fo l lowing proper t ies  
and in tu rn  se lec t  cer ta in  va lues  for  these  proper t ies  
in i t s  ne ighbour :  
- nat ive  or  fo re ign  s ta tus ,  
- lex ical  funct iona l i ty  {this p roper ty  is man i fes ted  by  
the  capac i ty  to rece ive  in f lec t ion) ,  
-- morpho log ica l  s ta tus  (as in the  above  s t ruc ture  
de f in i t ion  with add i t iona l  deta i led  c lass i f i ca t ion) ,  
and 
- lex ica l  c lass ,  i.e. par t  of speech  as  re f lec ted  in the  
in f lec t iona l  end ing .  
Spec i f i ca t ion  of these  proper t ies  is opt ional ;  however~ 
the more in fo rmat ion  prov ided ,  the  more res t r i c t ions  
w i th  respect  to the  genera l  s t ruc ture  fo rmula  a re  
ach ieved ,  so that  the  number  of potent ia l  l abe l l ings  
is  reduced  and  the  labe l l ings  themse lves  bear  more 
in format ion .  Thus ,  it is  poss ib le  to p rev ide  at  leas t  a 
par t ia l  t reatment  for  words  whose  s tems are  not  roD- 
resented  in the  2000 ent ry  lexicon. 
Should  no match be obta ined  in th i s  s top,  the  
process  is  repeated  wi th  a new segmentat ion  unt i l  
compat ib le  se ts  of features  a re  found.

Fig. 2 p resents  examples  of the  resu l t ing  segmen-  
ta t ions  and labe l l ings .  We see that  the  f i r s t  
segmentat ion  of Ante i l  ( "por t ion" )  is re jec ted ,  as  in 
th i s  case the  stem would be preceded by  a suf f ix  
(+ant+ be ing  a longer  segment  than  +an+, it  has  
rece ived  "pr io r i ty"  up to th i s  point) .  In  the  second 
segmentat ion ,  +an+ is cor rec t ly  recogn ized  as a 
non- lex ica l  E~tem, upon  which  a lexical  s tem may 
follow. I t  is  not  poss ib le  to spec i fy  the  lexical  c lass  
se lec ted  by  +an+, as  i t  combines  with al l  par ts  of 
speech;  and as  +toil+ can funct ion  as  a noun or  a 
verb  stem, there  resu l t  two potent ia l  l abe l l ings .  The 
ambigu i ty  cannot  be reso lved  at  th i s  s tage .  
The fo l lowing example is somewhat  more compl icated.  
Cruc ia l  here  is the  boundary  between the two s tems 
of the  compound Erwerbst~t iKen  ( "employees" ) :  the  
phono log ica l  consequences  of an  er ror  ( / I t /  ins tead  
of / s t / )  a re  qu i te  ser ious .  A f ter  the  cor rec t  seg-  
mentat ion  has  f ina l ly  been found,  th ree  poss ib le  
in terpreta t ions  a re  proposed .  Note that  +on+ can 
serve  as a par t i c ip le  morph (Z), so that  the  word 
would syntact i ca l l y  funct ion  as  an ad jec t ive .  
The th i rd  s tep  cons is ts  of add i t iona l  checks  and 
f iner  spec i f i ca t ions  in o rder  to i so late  the  cor rec t  
s t ruc ture  and  par t -o f - speech  ass ignment  for  the 
whole word.  For ins tance ,  if  a su f f ix  has  been  
ident i f ied  as  a poss ib le  past  par t i c ip le  morph,  th i s  
could  be ver i f ied  by  search ing  for  a cor respond ing  
pre f ix  (of. toil + t "shares"  vs .  ge  + tel l  + t 
"shared"). Another  check  could exp lo i t  cer ta in  re -  
s t r i c t ions  on the sequence  of lexical  and non- lex ica l  
s tems in a complex word,, Such  tes ts  have  not as  yet  
been  implemented.  
The lexical  c lass  of a German word is, genera l ly  
speak ing ,  determined  by  i t s  las t  e lement ,  so that  the  
c lass i f i ca t ion  a lgor i thm makes  use  of the  resu l t s  of 
the  match ing  process  at  the  end  of the word.  Some 
der ivat iona l  morphs ,  e.g.  +un~'h +keit+, +iech+, permi t  
unambiguous  c lass i f i ca t ion .  Unfor tunate ly  the  same 
cannot  be sa id  of in f lec t iona l  end ings  in par t i cu la r  
and  many o ther  e lements  as  well, taken  alone.  By ex -  
p lo i t ing  the  combinator ia l  in fo rmat ion ,  however ,  many 
ambigu i t ies  a re  e l iminated;  moreover ,  cap i ta l i za t ion  
can  be t reated  as  a s igna l  for  the  lex ica l  c lass  noun.  
Each text  un i t  is now prov ided  with a s t ruc tura l  
spec i f i ca t ion  i~uch that  the  phono log ica l ,  syntact i c  
and  prosod ic  component~ may operate  on it. Fig. 3 
shows  segmentat ions  and  lex ica l  c lass  ass ignment  for  
a sample  sentence ;  based  on these ,  the  phono log ica l  
component  a l ready  in p lace determines  the  cor rec t  
p ronunc ia t ion  and  generates  the  I.P.A. t ranscr ip t ion ,

4.  CONCLUSION 
Al though extens ive  tes ts  on large corpora  have not  
as  yet  been car r ied  out,  exper iments  with our  cur -  
rent  sys tem permit  evaluat ion of fol lowing aspects  of 
the morphological  ana lys i s  component  in GRAPHON: 
- The development  of the phonological  component  has 
shown that  the set t ing  up  of a cata logue of 
p ronunc ia t ion  ru les  became simpler and more 
systemat ic ,  and at the same time, the rate  of 
t ranscr ip t ion  er rors  could be great ly  reduced.  
- A re lat ive ly  limited number  of lexical ent r ies  is 
capable of hand l ing  a cons iderab le  quant i ty  of 
runn ing  text. The morphological  informat ion s tored  
in each ent ry  has proved to be re levant  and in 
genera l  suf f ic ient  for  cor rec t  segmentat ion.  
However, in o rder  to increase accuracy  in deter -  
mining lexical c lass,  as requ i red  by  the syntact ic  
analys is ,  it would be advantageous  to expand the 
number  of categor ies  represented  in the lexicon 
entr ies .  As it was not clear before the present  
tes ts  exactly which addit ional c lass i f icat ion would 
be usefu l ,  we chose to s tar t  from a minimum and 
prov ide  for  easy  fu ture  expansion.  For example, the 
experiments confirm our assumptionthat it would be 
desirable to specify the potential junctures for a 
given stem and to differentiate several inflectional 
paradigms within a lexical class, in particular 
strong and weak verbs. These data would have 
resolved the ambiguities encountered for the 
sample words in Fig. 2. 
- As the aims of our system do not include any 
attempt to incorporate semantics and as moreover 
there is no feedback from the syntactic component 
planned, a unique structural specification cannot 
be expected in the case of ambiguities requiring 
reference to these structural levels. Since such 
ambiguities do not necessarily lead to incorrect 
grammatical  speci f icat ion and only ra re ly  to 
incor rect  p ronunc ia t ion ,  th is  is only a re lat ive 
limitation. 
Cor rectness  of the phonemic t ranscr ip t ion  cer ta in ly  
accounts  for  a great  par t  of the qual i ty  and accepta -  
bil ity of a text - to -speech  system. Never the less  it is 
o f ten claimed {e.g. \[6\]) that  synthet ic  speech  should  
be evaluated a long fu r ther  dimensions,  such  as  inte\[-  
268 
l igibi l ity, l i s ten ing comprehens ion  and natura lness .  
One goal Of the approach  presented  here  is to lay 
the ground for  the incorporat ion  of ru les  for  the 
ass ignment  and real izat ion of s t ress  and intonat ion 
pat terns  not only on the word but  also on the sen-  
tence level. Thus  the basic phonet ic  t ranscr ip t ion  will 
be extended and modified so as to give a represen-  
tat ion c loser to natura l  speech.
