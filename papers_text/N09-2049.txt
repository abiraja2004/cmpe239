Abstract
We analyze the recognition errors made by
a morph-based continuous speech recognition
system, which practically allows an unlim-
ited vocabulary. Examining the role of the
acoustic and language models in erroneous
regions shows how speaker adaptive training
(SAT) and discriminative training with mini-
mum phone frame error (MPFE) criterion de-
crease errors in different error classes. An-
alyzing the errors with respect to word fre-
quencies and manually classified error types
reveals the most potential areas for improving
the system.
1 Introduction
Large vocabulary speech recognizers have become
very complex. Understanding how the parts of the
system affect the results separately or together is far
from trivial. Still, analyzing the recognition errors
may suggest how to reduce the errors further.
There exist previous work on analyzing recogni-
tion errors. Chase (1997) developed error region
analysis (ERA), which reveals whether the errors
are due to acoustic or language models. Greenberg
et al (2000) analyzed errors made by eight recog-
nition systems on the Switchboard corpus. The er-
rors correlated with the phone misclassification and
speech rate, and conclusion was that the acoustic
front ends should be improved further. Duta et al
(2006) analyzed the main errors made by the 2004
BBN speech recognition system. They showed that
errors typically occur in clusters and differ between
broadcast news (BN) and conversational telephone
speech (CTS) domains. Named entities were a com-
mon cause for errors in the BN domain, and hesita-
tion, repeats and partially spoken words in the CTS
domain.
This paper analyzes the errors made by a Finnish
morph-based continuous recognition system (Hir-
sima?ki et al, 2009). In addition to partitioning the
errors using ERA, we compare the number of let-
ter errors in different regions and analyze what kind
of errors are corrected when speaker adaptive train-
ing and discriminative training are taken in use. The
most potential error sources are also studied by par-
titioning the errors according to manual error classes
and word frequencies.
2 Data and Recognition System
The language model training data used in the experi-
ments consist of 150 million words from the Finnish
Kielipankki corpus. Before training the n-gram
models, the words of the training data were split
into morphs using the Morfessor algorithm, which
has been shown to improve Finnish speech recogni-
tion (Hirsima?ki et al, 2006). The resulting morph
lexicon contains 50 000 distinct morphs. A growing
algorithm (Siivola et al, 2007) was used for training
a Kneser-Ney smoothed high-order variable-length
n-gram model containing 52 million n-grams.
The acoustic phoneme models were trained on the
Finnish SpeechDat telephone speech database: 39
hours from 3838 speakers for training, 46 minutes
from 79 speakers for development and another simi-
lar set for evaluation. Only full sentences were used
and sentences with severe noise or mispronuncia-
tions were removed.

Figure 1: An example of a HYP-AM error region. The
scores are log probabilities. Word boundaries are denoted
by ?#?. The error region only contains one letter error (an
inserted ?n?).
The acoustic front-end consist of 39-dimensional
feature vectors (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
with first and second time-derivatives), global max-
imum likelihood linear transform, decision-tree tied
HMM triphones with Gaussian mixture models, and
cepstral mean subtraction.
Three models are trained: The first one is a max-
imum likelihood (ML) model without any adap-
tation. The second model (ML+SAT) enhances
the ML model with three iterations of speaker
adaptive training (SAT) using constrained maxi-
mum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) (Gales,
1998). In recognition, unsupervised adaptation
is applied in the second pass. The third model
(ML+SAT+MPFE) adds four iterations of discrim-
inative training with minimum phone frame error
(MPFE) criterion (Zheng and Stolcke, 2005) to the
ML+SAT model.
3 Analysis
3.1 Error Region Analysis
Error Region Analysis (Chase, 1997) can be used
to find out whether the language model (LM), the
acoustic model (AM) or both can be blamed for
an erroneous region in the recognition output. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the procedure. For each utter-
ance, the final hypothesis is compared to the forced
alignment of the reference transcript and segmented
into correct and error regions. An error region is
a contiguous sequence of morphs that differ from
the corresponding reference morphs with respect to
morph identity, boundary time-stamps, AM score,

LM score, or n-gram history1.
By comparing the AM and LM scores in the hy-
pothesis and reference regions, the regions can be
divided in classes. We denote the recognition hy-
pothesis as HYP, and the reference transcript as REF.
The relevant classes for the analysis are the follow-
ing. REF-TOT: the reference would have better to-
tal score, but it has been erroneously pruned. HYP-
AM: the hypothesis has better score, but only AM
favors HYP over REF. HYP-LM: the hypothesis has
better score, but only LM favors HYP over REF.
HYP-BOTH: both the AM and LM favor HYP.
Since the error regions are independent, the let-
ter error rate2 (LER) can be computed separately for
each region. Table 1 shows the error rates for three
different acoustic models: ML training, ML+SAT,
andML+SAT+MPFE.We see that SAT decreases all
error types, but the biggest reduction is in the HYP-
AM class. This should be expected. In the ML case,
the Gaussian mixtures contain much variance due to
different unnormalized speakers, and since the test
set contains only unseen speakers, many errors are
expected for some speakers. Adapting the models to
the test set is expected to increase the acoustic score
of the reference transcript, and since in the HYP-AM
regions the LM already prefers REF, corrections be-
cause of SAT are most probable there.
On the other hand, adding MPFE after SAT seems
1A region may be defined as an error region even if the tran-
scription is correct (only the segmentation differs). However,
since we are going to analyze the number of letter errors in the
error regions, the ?correct? error regions do not matter.
2The words in Finnish are often long and consist of several
morphs, so the performance is measured in letter errors instead
of word errors to have finer resolution for the results.

to reduce HYP-BOTH and HYP-LM errors, but not
HYP-AM errors. The number of search errors (REF-
TOT) also decreases.
All in all, for all models, there seems to be more
HYP-AM errors than HYP-LM errors. Chase (1997)
lists the following possible reasons for the HYP-
AM regions: noise, speaker pronounces badly, pro-
nunciation model is poor, some phoneme models
not trained to discriminate, or reference is plainly
wrong. The next section studies these issues further.
3.2 Manual Error Classification
Next, the letter errors in the error regions were
manually classified according to the most probable
cause. Table 2 shows the classes, the total number
of letter errors for each class, and the errors divided
to different error region types.
All errors that did not seem to have an obvious
cause are put under the class Other. Some of the er-
rors were a bit surprising, since the quality of the
audio and language seemed perfectly normal, but
still the recognizer got the sentences wrong. On the
other hand, the class also contains regions where the
speech is very fast or the signal level is quite low.
The largest class with a specific cause is Foreign,
which contains about 8 % of all letter errors. Cur-
rently, the morph based recognizer does not have
any foreign pronunciation modeling, so it is natural
that words like Ching, Yem Yung, Villeneuve, Schu-
macher, Direct TV, Thunderbayssa are not recog-
nized correctly, since the mapping between the writ-
ten form and pronunciation does not follow the nor-
mal Finnish convention. In Table 2 we see, that the
acoustic model prefers the incorrect hypothesis in al-
most all cases. A better pronunciation model would
be essential to improve the recognition. However,
integrating exceptions in pronunciation to morph-
based recognition is not completely straightforward.
Another difficulty with foreign names is that they
are often rare words, so they will get low language
model probability anyway.
The errors in the Acronym class are pretty much
similar to foreign names. Since the letter-by-letter
pronunciation is not modelled, the acronyms usually
cause errors.
The next largest class is Inflect, which contains
errors where the root of the word is correctly rec-
ognized, but the inflectional form is slightly wrong
(for example: autolla/autolle, kirjeeksi/kirjeiksi). In
these errors, it is usually the language model that
prefers the erroneous hypothesis.
The most difficult classes to improve are perhaps
Poor and Noise. For bad pronunciations and repairs
it is not even clear what the correct answer should
be. Should it be the word the speaker tried to say,
or the word that was actually said? As expected, the
language model would have preferred the correct hy-
pothesis in most cases, but the acoustic model have
chosen the wrong hypothesis.
The Name and Rare are also difficult classes.
Contrary to the foreign names and acronyms, the
pronunciation model is not a problem.

Subset of training data vocabulary (x 1000)
Figure 2: Frequency analysis of the SAT+MPFE system.
Number of letters in reference (top), number of letter er-
rors (middle), and letter error rate (bottom) partitioned
according to word frequencies. The leftmost bar corre-
sponds to the 1000 most frequent words, the next bar to
the 2000 next frequent words, and so on. The rightmost
bar corresponds to words not present in the training data.
The Compound errors are mainly in HYP-LM re-
gions, which is natural since there is usually lit-
tle acoustic evidence at the word boundary. Fur-
thermore, it is sometimes difficult even for humans
to know if two words are written together or not.
Sometimes the recognizer made a compound word
error because the compound word was often written
incorrectly in the language model training data.
3.3 Frequency Analysis
In order to study the effect of rare words in more de-
tail, the words in the test data were grouped accord-
ing their frequencies in the LM training data: The
first group contained all the words that were among
the 1000 most common words, the next group con-
tained the next 2000 words, then 4000, and so on,
until the final group contained all words not present
in the training data.
Figure 2 shows the number of letters in the ref-
erence (top), number of letter errors (middle), and
letter error rate (bottom) for each group. Quite ex-
pectedly, the error rates (bottom) rise steadily for the
infrequent words and is highest for the new words
that were not seen in the training data. But looking
at the absolute number of letter errors (middle), the
majority occur in the 1000 most frequent words.
4 Conclusions
SAT and MPFE training seem to correct different
error regions: SAT helps when the acoustic model
dominates and MPFE elsewhere. The manual error
classification suggests that improving the pronunci-
ation modeling of foreign words and acronyms is a
potential area for improvement. The frequency anal-
ysis shows that a major part of the recognition errors
occur still in the 1000 most common words. One
solution might be to develop methods for detecting
when the problem is in acoustics and to trust the lan-
guage model more in these regions.
