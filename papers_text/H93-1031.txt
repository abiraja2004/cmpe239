ABSTRACT 
Texts of a particular type evidence a discernible, predictable 
schema. These schemata can be delineated, and as such provide 
models of their respective text-types which are of use in 
automatically structuring texts. We have developed a Text 
Structurer module which recognizes text-level structure for use 
within a larger information retrieval system to delineate the 
discourse-level organization of each document's contents. 
This allows those document components which are more likely 
to contain the type of information suggested by the user's 
query to be selected for higher weighting. We chose 
newspaper text as the first text type to implement. Several 
iterations of manually coding a randomly chosen sample of 
newspaper articles enabled us to develop a newspaper text 
model. This process suggested that our intellectual 
decomposing of texts relied on six types of linguistic 
information, which were incorporated into the Text Structurer 
module. Evaluation of the results of the module led to a 
revision of the underlying text model and of the Text Structurer 
itself. 
1. D ISCOURSE-LEVEL  TEXT MODELS 
A discourse-level model of a text type can be likened to an 
interpretation model \[Breuker & Wielinga, 1986\] in that it 
specifies the necessary classes of knowledge to be identified 
in order to develop the skeletal conceptual structure for a 
class of entities. The establishment of text-type models 
derives from research in discourse linguistics which has 
shown that writers who repeatedly produce texts of a 
particular type are influenced by the schema of that text- 
type and, when writing, consider not only the specific 
content they wish to convey but also what the usual 
structure is for that type of text based on the purpose it is 
intended to serve \[Jones, 1983\]. As a result, one basic 
tenet of discourse linguistics is that texts of a particular 
type evidence the schema that exists in the minds of those 
who produce the texts. These schemata can be delineated, 
and as such provide models of their respective text-types 
which we suggest would be of use in automatically 
structuring texts. 
The existence of and need for such predictable structures in
texts is consistent with findings in cognitive psychology 
suggesting that human cognitive processes are facilitated 
by the ability to 'chunk' the vast amounts of information 
encountered in daily life into larger units of organized ata 
\[Rumelhart, 1977\]. Schema theories posit that during 
chunking we recode individual units of perception into 
increasingly larger units, until we reach the level of a 
schema. Humans are thought to possess chema for a wide 
range of concepts, events, and situations \[Rumelhart, 
1980\]. Discourse linguists have extended this notion to 
suggest hat schema exist for text-types that participate 
regularly in the shared communication of a particular 
community of users. 
What is delineated when a text schema is explicated is its 
discernible, predictable structure, referred to as the text's 
Superstructure. Superstructure is the text-level syntactic 
organization of semantic ontent; the global schematic 
structure; the recognizable template that is filled with 
different meaning in each particular example of that text- 
type \[van Dijk, 1980\]. Among the text-types for which 
schemas or models have been developed with varying 
degrees of detail are: folk-tales \[Propp, 1958\], newspaper 
articles \[van Dijk, 1980\], arguments \[Cohen, 1987\], 
historical journal articles \[Tibbo, 1989\], and editorials 
\[Alvarado, 1990\], empirical abstracts \[Liddy, 1991\], and 
theoretical bstracts \[Francis & Liddy, 1991\].

The goal of our current effort is to develop a component 
that can recognize text-level structure within a larger 
document detection system (DR-LINK) to enable the 
system to produce better etrieval results. For this system, 
we have focused our first efforts on newspaper texts, since 
the corpus we must process includes both the WEll Street 
Joornal and the Associated Press Newswire. 
2. DR-L INK 
DR-LINK is a multi-stage document detection system 
being developed under the auspices of DARPA's TIPSTER 
Project. The purpose of TIPSTER is to significantly 
advance the state of the art in document detection and data 
extraction from large, real-world data collections. The 
document detection part of the project focuses on retrieving 
relevant documents from gigabyte-sized ocument 
collections, based on descriptions of users' information 
needs called topic statements. The data extraction part 
processes a much smaller set of documents, presumed to be 
relevant to a topic, in order to extract information which is 
used to fill a database. 
The overall goal of DR-LINK is to simultaneously 1) 
focus the flow of texts through the system by selecting a
subset of texts on the basis of subject content and then 
highlighting those sub-parts of a document which are 
likely spots of relevant text while 2) enriching the 
semantic representation f text content by: a) delineating 
each text's discourse-level structure; b) detecting relations 
among concepts; c) expanding lexical representation with 
semantically-related rms; and d) representing concepts 
and relations in Conceptual Graphs. 
The purpose of the Text Structurer component in DR- 
LINK is to delineate the discourse-level organization of 
documents' contents o that processing at later stages can 
focus on those components where the type of information 
suggested in a query is most likely to be found. For 
example, in newspaper texts, opinions are likely to be 
found in EVALUATION components, basic facts of the news 
story are likely to be found in MAIN EVENT, and 
predictions are likely to be found in EXPECTATION. The 
Text Structurer produces an enriched representation f each 
document by decomposing it into smaller, conceptually 
labelled components. Operationally, DR-LINK evaluates 
each sentence in the input text, comparing it to the known 
characteristics of the prototypical sentence of each 
component of the text-type model, and then assigns a 
component label to the sentence. 
In a form of processing parallel to the Text Structurer, the 
Topic Statement Processor evaluates each topic statement 
to determine if there is an indication that a particular text 
model component in the documents should be more highly 
weighted when matched with the topic statement 
representation. For example, topic statement indicator 
terms such as predict or anticipate or proposed reveal that 
the time frame of the event in question must be in the 
future in order for the document to be relevant. Therefore, 
documents in which this event is reported in a piece of text 
which has been marked by the Text Structurer as being 
EXPECTATION would be ranked more highly than those in 
which this event is reported in a different ext model 
component 
3. DEVELOPMENT OF  THE NEWS 
SCHEMA MODEL 
The need for a text model specifically for newspaper text is 
necessitated by the fact that the journalistic style forsakes 
the linear logic of storytelling and presents the various 
categories of information in a recurrent cyclical manner 
whereby categories and the topics contained within them 
are brought up, dropped, and then picked up again for 
further elaboration later in the news article. This internal 
topical disorganization makes a story grammar, as well as 
the expository text models \[Britton & Black, 1985\] not 
appropriate as text models. 
Therefore, we took as a starting point, the uniquely 
journalistic, hierarchical newspaper text model proposed by 
van Dijk \[1988\]. With this as a preliminary model, several 
iterations of coding of a sample of 149 randomly chosen 
Wall Street Journal articles from 1987-1988 resulted in a 
revised News Schema which took from van Dijk's model 
the terminal node categories and organized them according 
to a more temporally oriented perspective, to support he 
computational task for which our model was to be used. 
We retained the segmentation f the overall structure into 
van Dijk's higher level categories, namely: Summary, 
Story and Comment, but added several terminal 
components a warranted by the data. 
The News Schema Components which comprise the model 
are the categories of information which account for all the 
text in the sample of articles. The components are: 
CIRCUMSTANCE - context in which main event occurs 
CONSEQUENCE - definite causal result of main event 
CREDENTIAL - credentials of author 
DEFINITION - definition of special terminology 
ERROR - mention of error that was made (in a correction) 
EVALUATION - author's comments on events 
EXPECTATION - likely or possible result of main event 
160 
HISTORY - non-recent past history of main event 
LEAD - first sentence or paragraph which introduces or 
summarizes article 
MAIN EVENT - text which advances the plot or main thread 
of the story 
NO COMMENT - refusal or unavailability of source to 
comment 
PREVIOUS EVENT - immediate past context for main event 
REFERENCE - reference to related article (title and date) 
VERBAL REACTION - quoted reaction from source to main 
event 
While coding the sample, we developed both defining 
features and properties for each component. The defining 
features convey the role and purpose of that component 
within the News Schema while the properties provide 
suggestive clues for the recognition of that component in a 
news article. The manual coding suggested to us that we 
were in fact relying on six different ypes of linguistic 
information during our coding. The data which would 
provide these evidence sources was then analyzed 
statistically and translated into computationally 
recognizable text characteristics. Briefly defined, the six 
sources of evidence used in the original Text Structurer are: 
L ikel ihood ~ Component  Occurring The unit of 
analysis for the first source of evidence is the sentence and 
is based on the observed frequency of each component in
our coded sample set. 
Order ~f Components - This source of evidence relies on 
the tendency of components to occur in a particular, 
relative order. For this source of evidence, we calculated 
across the coded files we had of each of the sample 
documents, looking not at the content of the individual 
documents, but the component label. We used this data to 
compute the frequency with which each component 
followed every other component and the frequency with 
which each component preceded every other component. 
The results are contained in two 19 by 19 matrices (one for 
probability of which component follows a given 
component and one for probability of which component 
precedes a given component). These two can be used in 
conjunction when there is a sentence lying between two 
other sentences which have already been coded for 
component or even when only the component of the 
preceding or following sentence is known. For example, if
a series of sentences, a-b-c, the component label for 
sentence b is unknown, but the labels for sentence a and c 
are known, these matrices provide evidence of the 
likelihood that b might be any of the components in the 
model. 
Lexical Clues - The third source of evidence is a set of 
one, two and three word phrases for each component. The 
set of lexical clues for each component was chosen based 
on observed frequencies and distributions. We were looking 
for words with sufficient occurrences, tatistically skewed 
observed frequency of occurrence ina particular component, 
and semantic indication of the role or purpose of each 
component. For example, all the clues for VERBAL 
REACTION reveal the distinctly informal nature of quoted 
comments and the much more personal nature of this 
component when compared to the other components in a 
newspaper text. 
Syntactic Sources We make use of two types of 
syntactic evidence: 1) typical sentence l ngth as measured 
in average number of words per sentence for each 
component; 2) individual part-of-speech distribution based 
on the output of the part-of-speech tagging of each 
document, using POST. This evidence helps to recognize 
those components which, because of their nature, tend to 
have a disproportionate number of their words be of a 
particular part of speech. For example, EVALUATION 
component sentences tend to have more adjectives than 
sentences in other components. 
Tense Distribution - Some components, as might be 
expected by their name alone, tend to contain verbs of a 
particular tense more than verbs of other tenses. For 
example, DEFINITION sentences seldom contain past tense, 
whereas the predominate nse in HISTORY and PREVIOUS 
EVENT sentences i  the past tense, based on POST tags. 
Continuation Clues The sixth and final source of 
evidence is based on the conjunctive relations uggested in
Halliday and Hasan's Cohes ion  i...nEn~lish. The 
continuation clues are lexical clues which occur in a 
sentence-initial position and were observed in our coded 
sample data to predictably indicate either that the current 
sentence continues the same component as the prior 
sentence (e.g. And or In addition) or that there is a change 
in the component (e.g. However or Thus). 
4. EMPIR ICAL  TEST ING OF  THE 
MODEL 
The above computational method of instantiating a
discourse-level model of the newspaper text-model has been 
incorporated in an operational system (DR-LINK). The 
original Text-Structurer evaluated each sentence of an input 
newspaper article against hese six evidence sources for the 
purpose of assigning a text-level label to each sentence. 
This implementation uses the Dempster-Shafer Theory of 
Evidence Combination \[Shafer, 1976\] to coordinate 
information from some very complex matrices of statistical 
values for the various evidence sources which were 
161 
generated from the intellectual analysis of the sample of 
149 _~.fiU Slre?\[ Journal articles. 
attribute is multi-valued: its possible values are "past", 
"present", past or present", and "future". 
Operationally, the text is processed a sentence at a time, 
and each source of evidence assigns a number between 0
and 1 to indicate the degree of support hat evidence source 
provides to the belief that a sentence is of a particular 
news-text component. Then, a simple supporting function 
for each component is computed and the component with 
the greatest support is selected. 
The Text Structurer was tested using five of the six 
evidence sources. (The algorithms for incorporating 
evidence from the continuation clues were not complete at 
the time of testing, so that evidence source was not added 
to the system.) We tested the Text Structurer on a set of 
116 Wall Street Journal articles, consisting of over two 
thousand sentences. 
The first run and evaluation of the original Text Structurer 
resulted in 72% of the sentences being correctly identified. 
A manual simulation of one small, heuristic adjustment 
was tested and improved the system's performance to74% 
of the sentences correctly identified. A second manual 
adjustment for a smaller sample of sentences resulted in 
80% correct identification of components for sentences. 
6. CURRENT MODEL 
As a result of our analysis of text based on its attributes, 
we revised both the text-type model and the algorithms 
used by the Text Structurer. Revisions to the model 
focused primarily on subdividing components and adding 
new components o fill in gaps in the model and make it 
more precise. Revisions to the processing algorithms 
include: 1) restricting the sources of evidence used to 
lexical clues only; 2) establishing an order of precedence 
for components; 3) moving from a single lexicon to a 
lexicon for each component; 4) discontinuing the use of 
the Dempster-Shafer method of evidence combination; 5) 
moving the level of analysis from the sentence to the 
clause level. 
The new components: 
CIRCUMSTANCE-STOCK - closing price of stock mentioned 
in the ~ticle 
CONSEQUENCE-PAST/PRESENT - past or present causal 
result of main event 
5. ATTRIBUTE MODEL 
After evaluating the preliminary results from the Text 
Structurer, we became dissatisified with some aspects of 
the model we developed and the processing based on that 
model. We needed a more precise way to define the 
components in the model, and we saw that frequently a
sentence contained information for more than one 
component. 
As a result, we developed a set of attributes of newspaper 
text in order to first better distinguish between similar 
components, and then to assign the attributes to text 
independent of component labels. These attributes are 
usually binary in nature. We identified eight attributes: 
Time, Tense, Importance, Attribution, Objectivity, 
Definiteness, Completion, and Causality. 
CONSEQUENCE-FUTURE - future causal result of main 
event 
EVALUATION - opinion attributed to a source 
EVALUATION-JOURNALIST - opinion not attributed to a 
some 
EXPECTATION-JOURNALIST - likely or possible result of 
main event not attributed to a source 
FIGURE DESCRIPTION - text which describes a nearby 
figure, table, etc. 
LEAD-ATTENTION - attention-getting lead (does not 
summarize) 
LEAD-FUTURE - lead which refers to the future 
For example, the Importance attribute has two possible 
values: "foreground" and "background". Components 
which are in the foreground include LEAD and MAIN 
EVENT; background components include CIRCUMSTANCE, 
DEFINITION, PREVIOUS EVENT, HISTORY, VERBAL 
REACTION, and NO COMMENT. The Objectivity attribute 
is also binary: its possible values are "objective" and 
"subjective".  Object ive components include 
CIRCUMSTANCE, MAIN EVENT, PREVIOUS EVENT, and 
HISTORY; subjective components include VERBAL 
REACTION, EVALUATION, and EXPECTAION. The Time 
LEAD-HISTORY - lead which refers to the non-recent past 
LEAD-PREVIOUS - lead which refers to the recent past 
MAIN-EXAMPLE - specific instance or example of main 
event 
MAIN-FUTURE - main event set in the future 
MAIN2 - alternate main event (new story) 
PAST - undated past context of main event

7. FUTURE WORK 
There are several areas we would like to explore, both in 
improving the operation of the Text Structurer and in 
demonstrating its applicability. One obvious way to 
improve the accuracy and coverage of the Text Structurer is
to expand the lexicons for each component, via corpus- 
guided acquisition of synonyms. Another possibility is 
that ordering and continuation evidence can in fact be used 
to augment lexical evidence, e.g. for sentences which 
should be labeled HISTORY and which follow a HISTORY 
lexical clue but which themselves do not contain any 
HISTORY clues. One area which needs improvement is 
distinguishing between foreground and background 
components, e.g. MAIN EVENT vs. CIRCUMSTANCE. It is 
clear that purely lexical information is not sufficient o 
make the distinction, and that patterns of verbs and other 
words, ordering, and other information are required, if not 
some internal understanding of the subject of the text. 
There are several possible uses of the Text Structurer 
module in a document detection system. Within DR- 
LINK, it can be used as a focusing mechanism (filter or 
weighting) for other modules, e. g. the Relation-Concept 
Detector, which identifies concepts and relations between 
concepts in text. For example, the Relation-Concept 
Detector can be set to emphasize those sentences which are 
labeled with a foreground component (LEAD, MAIN EVENT, 
etc.) by the Text Structurer. Another application outside of 
DR-LINK is as an intermeditate process between document 
detection and data extraction. Once a document is 
determined to be relevant, he Text Structurer can focus the 
data extraction process on those sentences or sentence 
fragments which are most likely to contain the information 
required to fill the database. 
8. CONCLUSIONS 
Although we are clearly in the early stages of development 
of the Text Structurer, we find these results quite 
promising and are eager to share our empirical results and 
experiences in creating an operational system with other 
computational linguists. To our knowledge, no similar, 
operational discourse structuring system has yet been 
reported in the literature. 
We have applied the newspaper text-type model to text 
from a different source, by coding a sample of AP 
Newswire articles. This effort verified that the model was 
general enough to handle news text from various sources; 
in fact, a subset of the model covered all cases seen in the 
AP text. 
We are in the process of evaluating the latest version of the 
Text Structurer based on the current newspaper text model. 
We will next apply a similar methodology to the 
development of a model and processing component for 
automatically structuring full-length, technical journal 
articles.
