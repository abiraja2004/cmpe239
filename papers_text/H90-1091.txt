Objectives: 
\[1\] To provide a central role in the design, develop- 
ment and dis~bution of speech corpora. 
\[2\] To design, coordinate implementation of, and 
analyze results of performance assessment tests 
for DARPA's Spoken Language Systems. 
\[4\] Coordinate Performance Evaluation Working 
Group activities for DARPA Spoken Language 
Systems and analyze the results of the June 1990 
SLS tests. 
\[5\] Design improved test procedures and administer 
additional Resource Management and ATIS 
domain tests prior to the February 1991 meeting. 
Recent Accomplishments: 
\[1\] Prepared the CD-ROM versions of the Resource 
Management (PSI )  and Extended Resource 
Management (RM2) Corpora (a total of six discs) 
for use within the DARPA speech research com- 
munity and for public distribution through the 
National Technical Information Service (NTIS). 
These discs include the scoring software and sta- 
tistical significance tools for benchmark perfor- 
mance assessment tests. 
\[2\] Developed additional performance analysis tools 
and applied these to all Resource Management 
benchmark test results reported to NIST since 
March 1987. 
\[3\] Coordinated Performance Evaluation Working 
Group activities for the DARPA Air Travel Infor- 
marion System (ATIS) common task, and admin- 
istered the first multi-site performance assessment 
test in this domain. 
Plans: 
\[1\] Prepare the complete TIMIT corpus for release in 
CD-ROM. 
\[2\] Prepare the complete Pilot ATIS Corpus for 
release in CD-ROM. 
\[3\] Collaborate with others (e.g., CMU,  and ((possi- 
bly)) NYNEX and IBM) in preparing other 
speech corpora for release in CD-ROM fonnat.
