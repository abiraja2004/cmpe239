Abstract
Dzongkha,  the  national  language  of 
Bhutan, is continuous in written form 
and it fails to mark the word boundary. 
Dzongkha word segmentation is one of 
the  fundamental  problems  and  a 
prerequisite  that  needs  to  be  solved 
before  more  advanced  Dzongkha  text 
processing and other natural  language 
processing  tools  can  be  developed. 
This paper presents our initial attempt 
at segmenting Dzongkha sentences into 
words.  The  paper  describes  the 
implementation of Maximal  Matching 
(Dictionary based Approach) followed 
by bigram techniques  (Non-dictionary 
based  Approach)  in  segmenting  the 
Dzongkha  scripts.  Although  the  used 
techniques  are  basic  and  naive,  it 
provides  a  baseline  of  the  Dzongkha 
word  segmentation  task.  Preliminary 
experimental  results  show  percentage 
of  segmentation  accuracy.  However, 
the segmentation accuracy is dependent 
on the  type  of  document  domain  and 
size and quality of the lexicon and the 
corpus. Some of the related issues for 
future directions are also discussed.
Keywords:  Dzongkha  script,  word 
segmentation,  maximal  matching,  bigram 
technique, smoothing technique.
1    Introduction
Segmentation of a sentence into word is one of 
the  necessary  preprocessing  tasks  and  is 
essential  in  the  analysis  of  natural  language 
processing.  This  is  because  word  is  both 
syntactically  and  semantically,  the 
fundamental  unit  for  analyzing  language 
structure.  Like  in  any  other  language 
processing task, Dzongkha word segmentation 
is also viewed as one of the fundamental and 
foremost  steps in Dzongkha related language 
processing tasks.
The most challenging features of Dzongkha 
script is the lack of word boundary separation 
between  the  words1.  So,  in  order  to  do  the 
further  linguistic  and  natural  language 
processing  tasks,  the  scripts  should  be 
transformed into a chain of words. Therefore, 
segmenting  a  word  is  an  essential  role  in 
Natural  Language  Processing.  Like  Chinese, 
Japanese  and  Korean  (CJK)  languages, 
Dzongkha  script  being  written  continuously 
without  any  word  delimiter  causes  a  major 
problem in natural language processing tasks. 
But,  in  case  of  CJK,  Thai,  and  Vietnamese 
languages,  many  solutions  have  been 
published  before.  For  Dzongkha,  this  is  the 
first  ever  word  segmentation  solution  to  be 
documented. 
In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  Dzongkha 
word segmentation, which is performed firstly 
using the Dictionary based approach where the 
principle  of  maximal  matching  algorithm  is 
applied  to  the  input  text.  Here,  given  the 
collection  of  lexicon,  the  maximal  matching 
algorithm selects the segmentation that yields 
the minimum number of words token from all 
possible segmentations of  the input  sentence. 
Then,  it  uses  non-dictionary  based  approach 
where  bigram  technique  is  applied.  The 
probabilistic  model  of  a  word  sequence  is

studied  using  the  Maximum  Likelihood 
Estimation  (MLE).  The  approach  using  the 
MLE has an obvious disadvantage because of 
the  unavoidably  limited  size  of  the  training 
corpora (Nuges, 2006). To this problem of data 
sparseness,  the  idea  of  Katz  back-off  model 
with  Good-Turing  smoothing  technique  is 
applied. 
2    Dzongkha Script
Dzongkha language is the official and national 
language of  Bhutan.  It  is  spoken as  the  first 
language  by  approximately  130,000  people 
and as the second language by about 470,000 
people (Van Driem and Tshering, 1998).
Dzongkha  is  very  much  related  to  Sino-
Tibetan  language  which  is  a  member  of 
Tibeto-Burmese  language  family.  It  is  an 
alphabetic  language,  with  phonetic 
characteristics  that  mirror  those  of  Sanskrit. 
Like many of the alphabets of India and South 
East  Asia,  the  Bhutanese  script  called 
Dzongkha script is also a syllabic2. A syllable 
can  contain  as  little  as  one  character  or  as 
many as six characters. And a word can be of 
one syllable, two syllable or multiple syllables. 
In the written form, Dzongkha script contains a 
dot, called Tsheg (  ? ) that serve as syllable and 
phrase delimiter, but words are not separated at 
all. 
For example,
Dzongkha Transliteration English Syllables
????? dmarpo red Single-syllabled
???????? slop-pon Teacher Two-syllabled
?????????? hjam-tog-to easy Three-syllabled
??????????? har-ri-hur-ri crowdedness/confusion Four-syllabled
Table 1: Different syllabled Dzongkha scripts. 
The  sentence  is  terminated  with  a  vertical 
stroke  called Shad (   ? ).  This  Shad acts  as  a 
full_stop.  The  frequent  appearance  of 
2http://omniglot.com/writing/tibetan.htm  
whitespace in the Dzongkha sentence serves as 
a phrase boundary or comma, and is a faithful 
representation  of  speech:  after  all  in  speech, 
we pause not between words, but either after 
certain phrases or at the end of sentence. 
The  sample  dzongkha  sentence  reads  as 
follows:
??????????????????????????? ????????????? ?????????
?????? ?????????????????????? ?????????????????????
??? ????????????????????????????? ?????????????????
????????? ???????????????? ????????????? ???????
??????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????
???????????????????????????????????? ?????? ???? ??
??????????????????????

Bhutan,  His  Majesty the  King  Jigme  Singye 
Wangchuck, in 1986.]
3    Materials and Methods
Since,  our  language  has  no  word  boundary 
delimiter,  the  major  resource  for  Dzongkha 
word segmentation  is  a  collection of  lexicon 
(dictionary).  For  such  languages,  dictionaries 
are  needed  to  segment  the  running  texts. 
Therefore, the coverage of a dictionary plays a 
significant  role  in  the  accuracy  of  word 
segmentation (Pong and Robert, 1994). 
The dictionary that we used contains 23,333 
word  lists/lexicons.  The  lexicons  were 
collected  from  ?Dzongkha  Dictionary?,  2nd 
Edition, Published by Dzongkha Development 
Authority,  Ministry  of  Education,  2005, 
(ddc@druknet.bt).  The  manually  segmented 
text corpus containing 41,739 tokens are also 
used  for  the  method.  The  text  corpora  were 
collected  from  different  sources  like 
newspaper articles, dictionaries, printed books, 
etc.  and  belong  to  domains  such  as  World 
Affairs,  Social  Sciences,  Arts,  Literatures, 
Adventures, Culture and History.  Some texts 
like poetry and songs were added manually. 
96
Table  below  gives  the  glimpse  of  textual 
domains contained in the text corpora used for 
the method (Chungku et al, 2010).

Figure  1  below  shows  the  Dzongkha  Word 
Segmentation Process. 
Figure  1:  Dzongkha  Word  Segmentation 
Process. 
Dzongkha  word  segmentation  implements  a 
principle  of  maximal  matching  algorithm 
followed by statistical (bigram) method. It uses 
a word list/lexicon at first to segment the raw 
input sentences. It then uses MLE principles to 
estimate  the  bigram  probabilities  for  each 
segmented words.  All  possible segmentation 
of an input sentence by Maximal Matching are 
then  re-ranked  and  picked  the  mostly  likely 
segmentation  from  the  set  of  possible 
segmentations  using  a  statistical  approach 
(bigram technique). This is to decide the best 
possible  segmentation  among  all  the  words 
(Huor et al, 2007) generated by the maximal 
matching  algorithm.  These  mechanisms  are 
described in the following
3.1    Maximal Matching Algorithm
The basic idea of Maximal matching algorithm 
is, it first generates all possible segmentations 
for  an  input  sentence  and  then  selects  the 
segmentation  that  contains  the  minimum 
number  of  word  tokens.  It  uses  dictionary 
lookup. 
We used the following steps to segment the 
given input sentence.
1. Read  the  input  of  string  text.  If  an 
input  line  contains  more  than  one 
sentence,  a  sentence  separator  is 
applied  to  break  the  line  into 
individual sentences.
2. Split input string of text by Tsheg(   ? ) 
into syllables.
3. Taking the next syllables, generate all 
possible strings
4. If the number of string is greater than 
n for some value n3
? Look  up  the  series  of  string  in  the 
dictionary to find matches, and assign 
some weight-age4 accordingly.
? Sort the string on the given weight-age
? Delete  (number  of  strings  ?  n)  low 
count strings.
5. Repeat from Step 2 until all syllables 
are processed.
The  above  mentioned  steps  produced  all 
possible segmented words from the given input 
sentence based on the provided lexicon. Thus, 
the overall accuracy and performance depends 
on the coverage of lexicon (Pong and Robert, 
1994).
3The greater the value of n, the better the chances of 
selecting the sentence with the fewest words from 
the possible segmentation. 
4If the possible string is found in the dictionary 
entries, the number of syllable in the string is 
counted. Then, the weight-age for the string is 
calculated as (number of syllable)2 else it carries the 
weight-age 0
97
3.2    Bigram Method
(a)    Maximum Likelihood Estimation5
In the bigram method, we make the 
approximation that the probability of a word 
depends on identifying the immediately 
preceding word. That is, we calculate the 
probability of next word given the previous 
word, as follows:
P ?w1n?=? i=1n P ?wi/w i?1?
where
? P ?wi /wi?1?= count ?wi?1w i ?count ?wi?1 ?
where
? count ?wi?1wi ? is  a  total  occurrence 
of  a  word  sequence  w i?1wi in  the 
corpus, and
? count ?wi?1? is a total occurrence of a 
word w i?1 in the corpus.
To make  P ?wi /wi?1? meaningful  for  i=1 , 
we  use  the  distinguished  token  <s>  at  the 
beginning of the sentence; that is, we pretend 
w0 = <s>. In addition, to make the sum of the 
probabilities  of  all  strings  equal  1,  it  is 
necessary to place a distinguished token </s> 
at the end of the sentence.
One of the key problems with the MLE is 
insufficient  data.  That  is,  because  of  the 
unavoidably limited size of the training corpus, 
vast majority of the word are uncommon and 
some of the bigrams may not occur at all in the 
corpus, leading to zero probabilities. 
Therefore,  following  smoothing  techniques 
were used to count the probabilities of unseen 
bigram.  
(b)    Smoothing Bigram Probabilistic
The  above  problem  of  data  sparseness 
underestimates the probability of some of the 
sentences  that  are  in  the  test  set.  The 
smoothing technique helps to prevent errors by 
making  the  probabilities  more  uniform. 
Smoothing  is  the  process  of  flattening  a

Theories, Implementation, and Application with

German (Cognitive Technologies) (95 ? 104). 
probability distribution implied by a language 
model  so that  all  reasonable  word sequences 
can  occur  with  some  probability.  This  often 
involves  adjusting  zero  probabilities  upward 
and high probabilities  downwards.  This way, 
smoothing  technique  not  only  helps  prevent 
zero probabilities but  the overall  accuracy of 
the  model  are  also  significantly  improved 
(Chen and Goodman, 1998).
In Dzongkha word segmentation, Katz back-
off  model  based  on  Good-Turing  smoothing 
principle is applied to handle the issue of data 
sparseness.  The  basic  idea  of  Katz  back-off 
model is to use the frequency of n-grams and if 
no n-grams are available, to back off to  (n-1) 
grams,  and  then  to  (n-2) grams  and  so  on 
(Chen and Goodman, 1998).
The  summarized  procedure  of  Katz 
smoothing technique is given by the following 
algorithm:6
Pkatz ?wi?wi?1 ?={ C ?wi?1 /wi ? ifr>kdrC ?wi?1 /wi ? ifk?r>0? ?wi?1 ?P ?wi ? ifr=0 }
where
? r is the frequency of bigram counts
? k  is  taken  for  some  value  in  the 
range of  5  to  10,  other  counts  are 
not re-estimated. 
? dr =

?
? ?wi?1? =
1? ?
wi :r>0
PKatz ?wi?w i?1?
1? ?
wi :r>0
PKatz ?w i ?
With the above equations, bigrams with non-
zero count  r  are discounted according to the

r  i.e.,  the  count

4    Evaluations and Results
Subjective evaluation has been performed by 
comparing  the  experimental  results  with  the 
manually segmented tokens. The method was 
evaluated  using  different  sets  of  test 
documents from various domains consisting of 
714  manually  segmented  words.  Table  3 
summarizes the evaluation results.

Table 3: Evaluation Results
Accuracy in %age are measured as:
Accuracy(%) = NT?100
where
? N is  the  number  of  correctly 
segmented tokens
? T is  the  total  number  of  manually 
segmented tokens/ Total number of 
words. 
We have taken the extract of different test data 
hoping it may contain fair amount of general 
terms, technical terms and common nouns. The 
manually segmented corpus containing 41,739 
tokens are used for the method. 
In the sample comparison below, the symbol 
(   ? )  does  not  make  the  segmentation  unit's 
mark,  but  (   ? )  takes  the  segmentation  unit's 
mark,  despite  its  actual  mark  for  comma  or 
full_stop. The  whitespace in the sentence are 
phrase boundary or comma,  and is  a faithful 
representation of speech where we pause not 
between words, but either after certain phrases 
or at the end of sentence. 
Consider the sample input sentence:
?????????????????? ????????????????????????????????? ???
?????????????????????????? ??????????????? ?????????
??????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????
???????? ??????? ??????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????
Manually  segmented  sentence  of  the  sample 
input sentence:
?????????????????? ????????????????????????????????? 
????????????????????????????? ??????????????? ?????
??????????????????? ??????????????????????????????
???????????????? ??????? ???????????????????????????
???????????????????????????????
Using maximal matching algorithm:
??????  ???  ?????  ????  ??????  ????????  ???  ????? 
?????  ????  ??  ???????  ????  ??  ?????  ???  ????? 
???  ???????  ???  ?????  ?????????  ????????  ??????? 
???????  ???  ????????  ????  ????  ????  ????  ???? 
????????  ???  ????  ?????  ???  ???????  ????  ???? 
????  ???????  ????  ????  ???  ??  ??  ?????  ????
System segmented version of the sample input 
sentence: Underlined text shows the incorrect 
segmentation.
?????????????????? ????????????????????????????????? 
?????????????????????????????  ????????????????????
???????????????????  ??????????????????????????????
99
????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????? ????  
5    Discussions
During the process of word segmentation, it is 
understood  that  the  maximal  matching 
algorithm is simply effective and can produce 
accurate segmentation only if all the words are 
present  in  the  lexicon.  But  since  not  all  the 
word entry can be found in lexicon database in 
real  application,  the  performance  of  word 
segmentation  degrades  when  it  encounters 
words that are not in the lexicon (Chiang et al, 
1992).
Following are the significant problems with 
the  dictionary-based  maximal  matching 
method  because  of  the  coverage  of  lexicon 
(Emerson, 2000):
? incomplete and inconsistency of the 
lexicon database
? absence of technical domains in the 
lexicon
? transliterated foreign names
? some  of  the  common  nouns  not 
included in the lexicon
? lexicon/word  lists  do  not  contains 
genitive  endings  ??? (expresses  the 
genitive relationship as a quality or 
characteristic of the second element, 
for  example,  ????????? 'son  of  a 
pauper') and  ?? (first  singular 
possessive,  for  example,  ???????? 
which  actually  is ????????? 'my 
daughter') that  indicates  possession 
or a part-to-whole relationship, like 
English 'of'.  
A Dzongkha sentence like:
????????????? ??????????????? ????
may include the following ambiguous possible 
segmentation based on simple dictionary 
lookup:
1.???????????????????????????????
this | Dzongkha | of | research | written 
document | is
2.???????????????????????????????
this | Dzongkha | of | arrange together | search/
expose | written document | is
3.???????????????????????????????
this | fortress | mouth/surface | of | research | 
written document | is
These  problems  of  ambiguous  word 
divisions, unknown proper names, are lessened 
and solved partially when it is re-ranked using 
the bigram techniques. Still the solution to the 
following issues needs to be discussed in the 
future. Although the texts were collected from 
widest range of domains possible, the lack of 
available  electronic  resources  of  informative 
text adds to the following issues:
? small  number  of  corpus  were  not 
very impressive for the method
? ambiguity  and  inconsistent  of 
manual  segmentation of a token in 
the  corpus  resulting  in 
incompatibility  and  sometimes  in 
conflict.
Ambiguity  and  inconsistency  occurs 
because of  difficulties  in  identifying  a  word. 
Since the manual segmentation of corpus entry 
was  carried  out  by  humans  rather  than 
computer, such humans have to be well skilled 
in identifying or understanding what a word is. 
The problem with the Dzongkha scripts that 
also hampers the accuracy of dzongkha word 
segmentation  includes  the  issues  such  as 
ambiguous  use  of  Tsheg  (   ? ) in  different 
documents.  There  are  two  different  types  of 
Tsheg: Unicode 0F0B (  ? ) called Tibetan mark 
inter  syllabic  tsheg is  a  normal  tsheg that 
provides  a  break  opportunity.  Unicode  0F0C 
(  ? ) called Tibetan Mark Delimiter Tsheg Bstar 
is  a  non-breaking  tsheg and  it  inhibits  line 
breaking.
For example,
input sentence with Tsheg 0F0B: 
?????????????????????? ????????????????????? ??????
???????????????
achieves 100% segmentation as follow:
100
??????? ??? ??????? ????? ??????? ??? ???? ???? ??? 
?? ???? ??? ????? ???? ??? 
whereas  the  same input  sentence with Tsheg 
0F0C is incorrectly segmented as follows:
??????????????????????? ?????????????????????? 
?????????????????????
There are also cases like shortening of words, 
removing  of  inflectional  words  and 
abbreviating of words for the convenience of 
the writer.  But  this  is  not  so reflected in the 
dictionaries, thus affecting the accuracy of the 
segmentation. 
Following words has a special abbreviated way 
of writing a letter or sequence of letters at the 
end of a syllable as
?????    as ???
??????  as ??? 
etc..  
6    Conclusion and Future works
This  paper  describes  the  initial  effort  in 
segmenting  the  Dzongkha  scripts.  In  this 
preliminary  analysis  of  Dzongkha  word 
segmentation,  the  preprocessing  and 
normalizations are not dealt with. Numberings, 
special  symbols  and  characters  are  also  not 
included. These issues will have to be studied 
in the future.  A lot of discussions and works 
also  have  to  be  done  to  improve  the 
performance of word segmentation. Although 
the study was a success,  there are still  some 
obvious limitations, such as its dependency on 
dictionaries/lexicon, and the current Dzongkha 
lexicon  is  not  comprehensive.  Also,  there  is 
absence  of  large  corpus  collection  from 
various  domains.  Future  work  may  include 
overall improvement of the method for better 
efficiency,  effectiveness and functionality,  by 
exploring  different  algorithms.  Furthermore, 
the inclusion of POS Tag sets  applied on n-
gram techniques which is proven to be helpful 
in handling the unknown word problems might 
enhance  the  performance  and  accuracy. 
Increasing  corpus  size  might  also  help  to 
improve the results.
