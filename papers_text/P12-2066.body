Abstract
Convolution kernels support the modeling of
complex syntactic information in machine-
learning tasks. However, such models are
highly sensitive to the type and size of syntac-
tic structure used. It is therefore an importan-
t challenge to automatically identify high im-
pact sub-structures relevant to a given task. In
this paper we present a systematic study inves-
tigating (combinations of) sequence and con-
volution kernels using different types of sub-
structures in document-level sentiment classi-
fication. We show that minimal sub-structures
extracted from constituency and dependency
trees guided by a polarity lexicon show 1.45
point absolute improvement in accuracy over a
bag-of-words classifier on a widely used sen-
timent corpus.
1 Introduction
An important subtask in sentiment analysis is sen-
timent classification. Sentiment classification in-
volves the identification of positive and negative
opinions from a text segment at various levels of
granularity including document-level, paragraph-
level, sentence-level and phrase-level. This paper
focuses on document-level sentiment classification.
There has been a substantial amount of work
on document-level sentiment classification. In ear-
ly pioneering work, Pang and Lee (2004) use a
flat feature vector (e.g., a bag-of-words) to rep-
resent the documents. A bag-of-words approach,
however, cannot capture important information ob-
tained from structural linguistic analysis of the doc-
uments. More recently, there have been several ap-
proaches which employ features based on deep lin-
guistic analysis with encouraging results including
Joshi and Penstein-Rose (2009) and Liu and Senef-
f (2009). However, as they select features manually,
these methods would require additional labor when
ported to other languages and domains.
In this paper, we study and evaluate diverse lin-
guistic structures encoded as convolution kernels for
the document-level sentiment classification prob-
lem, in order to utilize syntactic structures without
defining explicit linguistic rules. While the applica-
tion of kernel methods could seem intuitive for many
tasks, it is non-trivial to apply convolution kernels
to document-level sentiment classification: previous
work has already shown that categorically using the
entire syntactic structure of a single sentence would
produce too many features for a convolution ker-
nel (Zhang et al., 2006; Moschitti et al., 2008). We
expect the situation to be worse for our task as we
work with documents that tend to comprise dozens
of sentences.
It is therefore necessary to choose appropriate
substructures of a sentence as opposed to using the
whole structure in order to effectively use convolu-
tion kernels in our task. It has been observed that
not every part of a document is equally informa-
tive for identifying the polarity of the whole doc-
ument (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang and
Lee, 2004; Koppel and Schler, 2005; Ferguson et
al., 2009): a film review often uses lengthy objective
paragraphs to simply describe the plot. Such objec-
tive portions do not contain the author?s opinion and
are irrelevant with respect to the sentiment classifi-
338
cation task. Indeed, separating objective sentences
from subjective sentences in a document produces
encouraging results (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003;
Pang and Lee, 2004; Koppel and Schler, 2005; Fer-
guson et al., 2009). Our research is inspired by these
observations. Unlike in the previous work, however,
we focus on syntactic substructures (rather than en-
tire paragraphs or sentences) that contain subjective
words.
More specifically, we use the terms in the lexi-
con constructed from (Wilson et al., 2005) as the
indicators to identify the substructures for the con-
volution kernels, and extract different sub-structures
according to these indicators for various types of
parse trees (Section 3). An empirical evaluation on
a widely used sentiment corpus shows an improve-
ment of 1.45 point in accuracy over the baseline
resulting from a combination of bag-of-words and
high-impact parse features (Section 4).
2 Related Work
Our research builds on previous work in the field
of sentiment classification and convolution kernel-
s. For sentiment classification, the design of lexi-
cal and syntactic features is an important first step.
Several approaches propose feature-based learning
algorithms for this problem. Pang and Lee (2004)
and Dave et al. (2003) represent a document as a
bag-of-words; Matsumoto et al., (2005) extract fre-
quently occurring connected subtrees from depen-
dency parsing; Joshi and Penstein-Rose (2009) use
a transformation of dependency relation triples; Liu
and Seneff (2009) extract adverb-adjective-noun re-
lations from dependency parser output.
Previous research has convincingly demonstrat-
ed a kernel?s ability to generate large feature set-
s, which is useful to quickly model new and not
well understood linguistic phenomena in machine
learning, and has led to improvements in various
NLP tasks, including relation extraction (Bunescu
and Mooney, 2005a; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b;
Zhang et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009), question
answering (Moschitti and Quarteroni, 2008), seman-
tic role labeling (Moschitti et al., 2008).
Convolution kernels have been used before in sen-
timent analysis: Wiegand and Klakow (2010) use
convolution kernels for opinion holder extraction,
Johansson and Moschitti (2010) for opinion expres-
sion detection and Agarwal et al. (2011) for sen-
timent analysis of Twitter data. Wiegand and K-
lakow (2010) use e.g. noun phrases as possible can-
didate opinion holders, in our work we extract any
minimal syntactic context containing a subjective
word. Johansson and Moschitti (2010) and Agarwal
et al. (2011) process sentences and tweets respec-
tively. However, as these are considerably shorter
than documents, their feature space is less complex,
and pruning is not as pertinent.
3 Kernels for Sentiment Classification
3.1 Linguistic Representations
We explore both sequence and convolution kernels
to exploit information on surface and syntactic lev-
els. For sequence kernels, we make use of lexical
words with some syntactic information in the form
of part-of-speech (POS) tags. More specifically, we
define three types of sequences:
? SW, a sequence of lexical words, e.g.: A tragic
waste of talent and incredible visual effects.
? SP, a sequence of POS tags, e.g.: DT JJ NN IN
NN CC JJ JJ NNS.
? SWP, a sequence of words and POS tags,
e.g.: A/DT tragic/JJ waste/NN of/IN talent/NN
and/CC incredible/JJ visual/JJ effects/NNS.
In addition, we experiment with constituency tree
kernels (CON), and dependency tree kernels (D),
which capture hierarchical constituency structure
and labeled dependency relations between words,
respectively. For dependency kernels, we test with
word (DW), POS (DP), and combined word-and-
POS settings (DWP), and similarly for simple se-
quence kernels (SW, SP and SWP). We also use a
vector kernel (VK) in a bag-of-words baseline. Fig-
ure 1 shows the constituent and dependency struc-
ture for the above sentence.
3.2 Settings
As kernel-based algorithms inherently explore the
whole feature space to weight the features, it is im-
portant to choose appropriate substructures to re-
move unnecessary features as much as possible.

Unfortunately, in our task there exist several cues
indicating the polarity of the document, which are
distributed in different sentences. To solve this prob-
lem, we define the indicators in this task as subjec-
tive words in a polarity lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005).
For each polarity indicator, we define the ?scope?
(the minimal syntactic structure containing at least
one subjective word) of each indicator for different
representations as follows:
For a constituent tree, a node and its children
correspond to a grammatical production. There-
fore, considering the terminal node tragic in the con-
stituent structure tree in Figure 1(a), we extract the
subtree rooted at the grandparent of the terminal, see
Figure 2(a). We also use the corresponding sequence

of words in the subtree for the sequential kernel.
For a dependency tree, we only consider the sub-
tree containing the lexical items that are directly
connected to the subjective word. For instance, giv-
en the node tragic in Figure 1(d), we will extract its
direct parent waste integrated with dependency rela-
tions and (possibly) POS, as in Figure 2(b).
We further add two background scopes, one be-
ing subjective sentences (the sentences that contain
subjective words), and the entire document.
4 Experiments
4.1 Setup
We carried out experiments on the movie review
dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004), which consists of
340
1000 positive reviews and 1000 negative reviews.
To obtain constituency trees, we parsed the docu-
ment using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003). To obtain dependency trees, we passed
the Stanford constituency trees through the Stanford
constituency-to-dependency converter (de Marneffe
and Manning, 2008).
We exploited Subset Tree (SST) (Collins and
Duffy, 2001) and Partial Tree (PT) kernels (Mos-
chitti, 2006) for constituent and dependency parse
trees1, respectively. A sequential kernel is applied
for lexical sequences. Kernels were combined using
plain (unweighted) summation. Corpus statistics are
provided in Table 1.
We use a manually constructed polarity lexicon
(Wilson et al., 2005), in which each entry is annotat-
ed with its degree of subjectivity (strong, weak), as
well as its sentiment polarity (positive, negative and
neutral). We only take into account the subjective
terms with the degree of strong subjectivity.
We consider two baselines:
? VK: bag-of-words features using a vector ker-
nel (Pang and Lee, 2004; Ng et al., 2006)
? Rand: a number of randomly selected sub-
structures similar to the number of extracted
substructures defined in Section 3.2
All experiments were carried out using the SVM-
Light-TK toolkit2 with default parameter settings.
All results reported are based on 10-fold cross vali-
dation.
4.2 Results and Discussions
Table 2 lists the results of the different kernel type
combinations. The best performance is obtained by
combining VK and DW kernels, gaining a signifi-
cant improvement of 1.45 point in accuracy. As far
as PT kernels are concerned, we find dependency
trees with simple words (DW) outperform both de-
pendency trees with POS (DP) and those with both
words and POS (DWP). We conjecture that in this
case, as syntactic information is already captured by
1A SubSet Tree is a structure that satisfies the constraint that
grammatical rules cannot be broken, while a Partial Tree is a
more general form of substructures obtained by the application
of partial production rules of the grammar.

the dependency representation, POS tags can intro-
duce little new information, and will add unneces-
sary complexity. For example, given the substruc-
ture (waste (amod (JJ (tragic)))), the PT kernel will
use both (waste (amod (JJ))) and (waste (amod (JJ
(tragic)))). We can see that the former is adding no
value to the model, as the JJ tag could indicate ei-
ther positive words (e.g. good) or negative words
(e.g. tragic). In contrast, words are good indicators
for sentiment polarity.
The results in Table 2 confirm two of our hy-
potheses. Firstly, it clearly demonstrates the val-
ue of incorporating syntactic information into the
document-level sentiment classifier, as the tree k-
ernels (CON and D*) generally outperforms vector
and sequence kernels (VK and S*). More impor-
tantly, it also shows the necessity of extracting ap-
propriate substructures when using convolution ker-
nels in our task: when using the dependency kernel
(VK+DW), the result on lexicon guided substruc-
tures (Sub) outperforms the results on document,
sentence, or randomly selected substructures, with
statistical significance (p<0.05).
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We studied the impact of syntactic information on
document-level sentiment classification using con-
volution kernels, and reduced the complexity of the
kernels by extracting minimal high-impact substruc-
tures, guided by a polarity lexicon. Experiments
341
show that our method outperformed a bag-of-words
baseline with a statistically significant gain of 1.45
absolute point in accuracy.
Our research focuses on identifying and using
high-impact substructures for convolution kernels in
document-level sentiment classification. We expect
our method to be complementary with sophisticated
methods used in state-of-the-art sentiment classifica-
tion systems, which is to be explored in future work.
