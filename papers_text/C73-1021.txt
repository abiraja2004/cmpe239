RECONSTRUCTING PREHISTORIC LANGUAGES ON THE 
COMPUTER: THE TRIUMPH OF THE ELECTRONIC 
NEOGKAMMARIAN 
1. THE PROJECT 
The prime principle lying behind all comparative linguistics is the 
regularity of sound change. Without this principle, comparative lin- 
guistics would be mere empty speculation: any ad hoc rule could be 
created on the spur of the moment o justify the most fanciful ety- 
mology. But with the principle of the regularity of sound change com- 
parative linguistics becomes a rigorous science: 1 it is possible to pro- 
pose a hypothesis, and then demonstrate clearly from the data whether 
the hypothesis works or not. In classic scientific method if the hypothesis 
does not work, it is to be abandoned; if it does work it must be shown 
to apply to all of the data in a completely coherent fashion. All appar- 
ent anomalies must therefore be either explained as the effects of some 
other cause: as a result of analogy, or borrowing or dialectal interfer- 
ence. 
The so-called neogrammarians who developed and elaborated this 
principle of the regularity of sound change a hundred years ago were 
guilty, like most revolutionaries, of pushing their doctrine to an extreme 
position. Today we are aware that sound change is a very complex 
phenomenon and not at all the somewhat simplistic regular shifting 
from proto language to daughter language that they imagined. Every 
language is, for a start, a collection of different dialects, and the same 
must be considered true of those proto languages we try to describe 
in our reconstructions. We must, as well, rid ourselves of the sim- 
plistic notion of a proto language being a centre from which, at some 
select and special .moment of history, all the daughter languages began 
1 It is possible for a science to be rigorous without being exact; comparative lin- 
guistics is not an exact science. An exact science deals with mechanical laws, a rigorous 
science deals with observed regularities.

to diverge like the spokes of a wheel. Our knowledge of phyla and 
families shows us that the splitting off is much more haphazard, and 
that there can be contact and interference long after the original dia- 
lectal split. 
Nevertheless, the principle of the regularity of sound change re- 
mains of fundamental importance, and will remain of fundamental 
importance in the discipline of comparative linguistics. And it follows 
that if sound change is regular then it should be possible to make use 
of machine methods in the reconstruction of proto languages. It was 
with such a plan in view that we set to work in the summer of 1971 
to devise computer strategies that would enable us, from an input 
of four daughter languages, to reconstruct the lexicon of a proto lan- 
guage and produce a proto language dictionary on the computer from 
the raw input of the daughter languages. 
We chose four fairly closely related Amerindian languages to work 
with: Fox, Cree, Menomini and Ojibwa, from which we hoped to 
reconstruct a lexicon of Proto Algonkian. The correspondences of these 
four languages had been originally worked out some fifty years ago 
by LEONARD BLOOMFIELD in an article in the first volume of Language, 
now famous for its solitary footnote on the universality of the princi- 
ple of sound change. Bloomfield later refined this work in his masterly 
sketch entitled Algonquian in the volume Linguistic Structures of Native 
America edited by HOIJER. In short, the sound system of Proto Algon- 
kian had been long before thoroughly worked out, so that we were 
in a position to enter all the reflexes and correspondences into the com- 
puter programming as necessity might arise. But, and this was the fac- 
tor of interest, although the sound system had been worked out for 
the proto language, no one had ever applied Bloomfield's correspon- 
dences and reflexes to the totality of the data of the four daughter 
languages from which he worked, so that only a few hundred words 
of Proto Algonkian had ever been reconstructed, in spite of the lapse 
of over half a century. Reconstruction is, of course, enormously time 
consuming, and a dictionary of a proto language normally takes many 
years to produce. 
Our aim, therefore, was: to devise a ~programme that would use 
the correspondences and reflexes of the daughter languages to find 
cognates in an input of raw data in these languages and to reconstruct 
proto forms for these cognates. The proto forms and the cognates from 
which they had been generated would then be assembled on the com- 
puter in the form of a proto language lexicon or dictionary.

2. THE APPROACH 
The phonology of reconstructed Proto Algonkian has three main 
aspects: the consonants of which there are 12, the consonant clusters 
of which there are 32, and the vowels of which there are 8. Since the 
correspondences of the consonants and the consonant clusters in AI- 
gonkian (as in other language families) show greater egularity and 
simplicity than the vowel correspondences, the decision was made 
from the beginning to concentrate he search for cognates on the cor- 
respondences of consonants and consonant clusters alone, and to ignore 
the vowels. This is necessary for two reasons: a) to spread the net wider, 
and b) to simplify programming and reduce machine time. 
The team that embarked upon this project was composed of lin- 
guists and computer personnel. The linguists envisaged a programme 
that would start with a word in one language and by generating the 
possibilities inherent in the correspondences s arch for a cognate in the 
same grammatical nd semantic area in a second language. It is quite 
easy for such generated possibilities to run to computations of 30 or 
40 forms, so that one word in Fox, for example, could generate a
search for 30 or more possibilities in Cree, perhaps find one, perhaps 
find more than one, or perhaps draw a blank. The search would then 
continue o11 to Menomini, taking into account he possibly considera- 
ble information already accumulated from Cree in order to compute 
the possibilities to be sought for in Menomini, where again one might 
find a possible cognate, more than one, or zero. To proceed on to 
Ojibwa would then require all the previous information to be digested 
before predicting and searching for the possibilities in Ojibwa. 
One of the worst aspects of this strategy (apart from its complexity) 
is the impossibility of preventing the machine from deciding (on the 
consonant correspondences, semantic and grammatical categories alone) 
that a word is cognate, when the linguist can tell at a glance (from the 
English gloss, or from the vowel correspondences) that it is not. The 
machine then proceeds to assimilate this false information and compounds 
the error by using it in its further predictions. 
For example, for Fox poohkdamwa " he cuts it open ", the Cree 
consonant possibilities are only 
phksm 
p sksm 
266 JOHN m~WSON 
but such a programme would find both Cree paaskisam "he shoots 
it" and pooskosam " he cuts it open ". On the basis of this data the 
programme would then generate the following possibilities for Meno- 
mini: 
phk  sm 
p hk hs m 
p hk 2s m 
p ~k s m 
p ~k hs m 
p ~k 2s m 
No cognates would be found in Menomini, however, and the 
programme would proceed to generate the following set of possibil- 
ities for Ojibwa: 
p kk In  
p kk ssVV n 
p kk n~ n 
p ~k ~ n 
p~k~n 
p ~k n~e n 
For this set the following would be declared cognate: Ojibwa 
pa~ko~aan " he cuts it down ", pakkwedaan "he slices off a part ", 
neither of which is truly cognate with either the Fox or Cree items. 
The end result of such a programme, therefore, would be almost nil. 
When the problems with this approach became obvious, a totally 
different strategy was proposed by the computer personnel. In this 
strategy the first procedure is to extract he consonant framework of 
every input word in the raw data file (R/F) and to create a new file 
(N/F) listing these consonant frameworks. A sample of R/F is given 
in APPENDIX A, and a sample of N/F is given in APPENDIX B. 
Secondly every possible proto form is generated from the known 
reflexes for the consonant framework of each word. This is done very 
simply, in a single pass, and the results tored in file W/F. On our first 
run, with 3,403 items in R/F and N/F, we generated 74,049 proto 
form potentialities (proto-projections) showing an average of over 21 
possible proto-projections for every item of raw input. 
Thirdly a massive alphabetical sort is carried out to collate all the 
proto-projections in file W/F in alphabetical order within identical 
RECONSTRUCTING PREHISTORIC LANGUAGES ON THE COMPUTER 267 
grammatical nd semantic sets. The result of this sort is that all identi- 
cal proto-projections in the same semantic and grammatical categories 
are collated together: in this way they may be distinguished from those 
proto-projections that occur only once. 
Fourthly, all sets of identical proto-projections are sorted into a 
new file Cx/F, and the results of this file are printed out. A sample 
of this printout is given in AVVENDIX C. It is remarkable that out of 
a total of 74,049 proto-projections only 1,305 items were transferred 
to Cx/F, these being the only items that showed identical proto-projec- 
tions in another language. 
A major edit is made at this point in the system by the linguist, 
who surveys the sets of proto-projections, and, from his background 
knowledge decides on the correct reconstruction and adds the vowels. 
This amended reconstruction is then keypunched, along with the code 
numbers which give access to the cognates from which it is generated. 
The final dictionary file (D/F) is then established by a programme which 
first enters the reconstruction, then enters the cognates by identifying 
them, removing them to the dictionary file and deleting them from 
the raw data file. A sample of the final dictionary file, which may 
be used as input to an automated typesetting machine, is given in AP- 
PENDIX D. 
The machine used was an I~M 370/155 and the following were the 
statistics of the first run of data with general programming in FORTRAN 
but using COBOL for the sorts: 
File Size CPU 
(1) R/F N/F 3403 0. 5.52 
(2) N/F W/F 74049 8.23.81 
(3) W/F P/F 74049 1.51.44 
(4) P/F Cx/F 1305 1.01.14 
Total 11.21.92 
3. CONCLUSIONS 
It should be emphasized that this method does not use the cor- 
respondences (or sound relationships between daughter languages) in 
order to predict possible cognates, but the reflexes (or sound relationships 
between each daughter language and the proto language). All the 
268 JOHN HEWSON 
possible proto forms (consonants and consonant clusters only) are gen- 
erated rather than all the potential cognates. What is important is 
that the machine does not gather and sort information and make de- 
cisions in order to proceed to the next step: it simply generates all 
the possibilities in one fell swoop, and then collates identical possi- 
bilities together. This technique streamlines the whole process and, 
ultimately, leaves to the linguist the decision as to whether a word 
is cognate or not. 
It is also of importance that the major edit in this system comes at 
a strategically important moment: after possible cognates have been 
collated, and all possible proto-projections listed, but before any de- 
cisions have been taken as to what is actually cognate. The machine, 
in short, carries out the time consuming task of seeking out the possi- 
bilities hidden in the masses of data and presenting them to the linguist. 
All that the linguist then has to do is to decide on the items that are 
genuinely cognate. 
The same basic strategy may be applied to any closely related fam- 
ily of languages, although the programming must be closely tailored 
to the details of the languages themselves. The languages used should 
be conservative enough to retain sufficient discriminatory features and 
should also generally correlate with each other in syllable structure if 
the programming and machine time are to be kept within reasonable 
bounds. If one were to attempt he reconstruction of Proto-R.omance, 
for example, it would be advisable to use Sardinian, Spanish, Italian 
and l~umanian, and leave the French evidence out. The loss of inter- 
vocalic consonants, of final vowels and final consonants has much 
reduced the materiality of cognates in French, and thereby reduced their 
discriminatory power. A comparison of Italian agosto (with its 6 pho- 
nemes) and French ao~t (with its one phoneme) immediately demonstra- 
tes how much historical information is conveyed by the Italian word 
and how little the French word tells us. 
The French data, and that of other divergent languages can be ad- 
ded later, in fact, in much simpler fashion once the basic proto diction- 
ary has been established. From a given Proto-Romance form it 
should be possible to predict reasonably accurately what the French 
word (if it exists) is likely to be. If one can define an item in such a 
way it would be a simple matter to initiate a search for it. 
The proto forms must be found, in short, by working back upstream 
in time. This is the difficult part of the task and is best done from the 
evidence of conservative languages. Once this difficult upstream work 
RECONSTRUCTING PREHISTORIC LANGUAGES ON THE COMPUTER 269 
has been done, it is possible by much easier downstream ethods to 
correlate the evidence from the divergent languages. 
In both cases there will be a residue once the obvious cases have 
been dealt with by machine methods. This residue can then be printed 
out so that the linguist can direct his efforts to the challenging problems 
that remain when the purely mechanical and regular items have been 
cleared from the data. 
Such a strategy utilizes the best possible interaction and integration 
of man and machine. Man is poorly designed for collating masses of 
data, but is able to bring a wide range of knowledge and interpretation 
to a single item of data at any one time. The machine, on the other 
hand, betrays a certain inanity when it comes to matters of interpreta- 
tion, since it has no knowledge of the world, and is thereby obliged 
to form its interpretations on mere surface appearances. The capacity 
of the machine to collate and search, on the other hand, may well 
arouse our admiration. As for the combination of man and machine, 
we are only just beginning to realize the potentialities that this combi- 
nation has for the world of scholarship, and especially for the disci- 
pline of Linguistics.
