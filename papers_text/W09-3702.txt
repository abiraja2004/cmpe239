Abstract
Supervised word sense disambiguation requires training corpora that
have been tagged with word senses, and these word senses typically come
from a pre-existing sense inventory. Space limitations imposed by dictio-
nary publishers have biased the field towards lists of discrete senses for an
individual lexeme. This approach does not capture information about relat-
edness of individual senses. How important is this information to knowing
which sense distinctions are critical for particular types of NLP applications?
How much does sense relatedness affect automatic word sense disambigua-
tion performance? Recent psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate that
closely related word senses may be represented in the mental lexicon much
like a single sense, whereas distantly related senses may be represented more
like discrete entities. These results suggest that, for the purposes of WSD,
closely related word senses can be clustered together into a more general
sense with little meaning loss. This talk will describe the relatedness of verb
senses and its impact on NLP applications and WSD components as well as
recent psycholinguistic research results.
