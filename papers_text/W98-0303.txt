? Abstract 
Electronic Essay Rater (e-rater) is a prototype automated essay scoring system built at Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) that uses discourse marking, in addition to syntactic information and topical content vector analyses to 
automatically assign essay scores. This paper gives a general description ore-rater as a whole, but its emphasis is on 
the importance of discourse marking and argument partitioning for annotating the argument structure of an essay. 
We show comparisons between two content vector analysis programs used to predict scores .  EsscQ/'Content and 
ArgContent. EsscnContent assigns cores to essays by using a standard cosine correlation that treats the essay like a 
"'bag of words." in that it does not consider word order. Ark, Content employs a novel content vector analysis 
approach for score assignment based on the individual arguments in an essay. The average agreement between 
ArgContent scores and human rater scores is 82%. as compared to 69% agreement between EssavContent and the 
human raters. These results suggest hat discourse marking enriches e-rater's coring capability. When e-rater uses 
its whole set of predictive features, agreement with human rater scores ranges from 87?,/o - 94% across the 15 sets of 
essa5 responses used in this study 
1. Introduction 
The development of Electronic Essay Rater (e-rater). 
an automated prototype essay scoring system, was 
motivated by practical concerns of time and costs that 
limit the number of essay questions on current 
standardized tests. Literature on automated essay 
scoring shows that reasonably high agreement can be 
achieved between a machine score and a human rater 
score simply by doing analyses based on the number 
o f  words in an essay (Page and Peterson (1995)). 
Scoring an essay based on the essay length is not a 
criterion that can be used to define competent 
writing. In addition, from a practical standpoint. 
essay length is a highly coachable feature. It doesn't 
take examinees long to figure out that a computer 
will assign a high score on an essay based on a pre- 
specified number of words. 
E-rater's modules extract syntactic and discourse 
structure information from essays, as well as 
information about vocabulary content in order to 
predict the score. The 57 features included in e-rater 
15 
are based on writing characteristics specified at each 
of the six score points in the scoring guide used by 
human raters for manual scoring (also available at 
http://www.gmat.org;). For example, the scoring 
guide indicates that an essay that stays on the topic 
of the test question, has a strong, coherent and well- 
organized argument structure, and displays a variety 
of word use and syntactic structure will receive a 
score at the higher end of the six-point scale (5 or 6}. 
Lower scores are assigned to essays as these 
characteristics diminish. 
Included in e-rater's feature set are features derived 
from discourse structure, syntactic structure, and 
topical analysis as they relate to the human scoring 
guide. For each essay question, e-rater is run on a 
set of training data (human-scored essay responses) 
to extract t~.atures. A stepwise linear regression 
analysis is performed on the features extracted from 
the training set to determine which ones have 
significant weights (the predictive features). Final 
score prediction for cross-validation sets is performed 
using these predictive features identified in the 
training sets. Accuracy is determined by measuring 
agreement between human rater assigned scores and 
machine predicted scores, which are considered to 
"agree" if there is no greater than a single point 
difference on the six-point scale. This is the same 
criterion used to measure agreement between two 
human raters. 
Among the strongest predictive features across the 
essay questions used in this study are the scores 
generated from ArgContent (a content vector analysis 
applied to discourse chunked text), and discourse- 
related surface cue word and non-lexical features. On 
average, ArgContent alone has 82% agreement with 
the human rater score as compared to EssavContent's 
69%. EssayContent is a content vector analysis 
program that treats an essay like a "'bag of words." 
This suggests two things. First, the discourse 
markers detected by the argument annotation and 
partitioning program. APA. are helpful for 
identification of relevant units of discourse in essay 
responses. Second. the application of content vector 
analysis to those text units appears to increase 
scoring performance. Overall, it appears that 
discourse marking provides feature information that 
is useful in e-rater's essay score predictions. 
A long-term goal of automated essay scoring is to be 
able to generate diagnostic or instructional 
information, along with a numeric score to a test- 
taker or instructor. Information about the discourse 
structure of essays brings us closer to being able to 
generate informative feedback to test-takers about the 
essay's cohesion. 
We report on the overall evaluation results from c- 
rater's scoring performance on 13 sets of essay data 
from the Analytical Writing Assessments of the 
Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) 
(see http://www.gmat.org/) and 2 sets of essay data 
from the Test of Written English (TWE) (see 
http://w.w.w.toefl.or~tstprpmt.html for sample TWE 
questions). The paper devotes pecial attention to e- 
rater's discourse marking and analysis components. 
2. Hybrid Feature Methodology 
E-rater uses a hybrid feature approach in that it 
incorporates several variables that are derived 
statistically, or extracted through NLP techniques. 
The following sections describe the features used in 
this study. 
2.1 Syntactic Features 
The scoring guides indicate that one feature used to 
evaluate an essay is syntactic variety. Syntactic 
structures in essays are identified using NLP 
techniques. All sentences are parsed with the 
Microsoft Natural Language Processing tool 
(MSNLP) (see MSNLP(1997)). Examination of  the 
parse trees yields information about syntactic variety 
with regard to what kinds of clauses or verb types 
were used by a test-taker. 
A program was implemented to identify the number 
of complement clauses, subordinate clauses, 
infinitive clauses, relative clauses and occurrences of  
tile subjunctive modal auxiliary, verbs, would, could, 
.~'hould. might and may, tbr each sentence in an essay. 
Ratios of syntactic structure types per essay and per 
sentence were calculated as possible measures of  
syntactic variety. 
2.2 Discourse Structure Analysis 
GMAT essay questions are of two types: Analysis of  
an Issue (issue) and Analysis of  an Argument 
(argument). The issue essay asks the writer to 
respond to a general question and to provide "reasons 
and'or examples" to support his or her position on an 
issue introduced by the test question. The argument 
essay tbcuses the writer on the argument in a given 
piece of text. using the term argument in tile sense of  
a rational presentation of points with the purpose of  
persuading the reader. The scoring guides used for 
manual scoring indicate that an essay will receive a 
score based on the examinee's demonstration of  a 
well-developed essay. For the argument essay', for 
instance, tile scoring guide states that a "'6"" essay 
"'develops ideas cogently, organizes them logically, 
and connects them with clear transitions." The 
correlate to this for the issue essay would appear to 
be that a "'6"" essay "'...develops a position on the 
issue with insightful reasons..." and that the essay "'is 
clearly well-organized.'" Nolan (I 997) points out that 
terms in holistic scoring guides, such as "'cogent." 
"'logical." "'insightful." and "'well-organized" have 
"'fuzzy" meaning, since they are based on imprecise 
observation. Nolan uses methods of"fuzzy, logic" 
to automatically assign these kinds of "fuzzy" 
classifications to essays. In this study, we try, to 
identify organization of  an essay through automated 
analysis and identification of the essay's argument 
structure through discourse marking. 
16 
Since there is no particular text unit that reliably 
Corresponds to the stages, steps, or passages of an 
argument, readers of an essay must rely on other 
things such as surface cue words to identify 
individual arguments. We found that it was useful to 
identify rhetorical relations such as Parallelism and 
Contrast. and content or coherence relations that 
have more to do with the discourse involved. These 
relations can appear at almost any level -- phrase, 
sentence, a chunk consisting of several sentences, or 
paragraph. Therefore, we developed a program to 
automatically identify the discourse unit of text using 
surface cue words and non-lexical cues. 
arg_init#PARALLEL = also 
arg_init#CLAIM_THAT = that 
arg_aux#SPECULATE =mav

Figure I: APA Output for 2 Essay Sentences 
As literature in the field of  discourse analysis points 
out. surface cue words and structures can be 
identified and used for computer-based discourse 
analysis (Cohen (1984), (Mann and Thompson 
(1988), Hovy. et al(1992) Hirschberg and Litman 
(1993), Vander Linden and Martin (1995), Knott 
(1996) and Litman (1996)). E-rater's AP.4 module 
uses surface cue words and non-lexical cues (i.e., 
syntactic structures) to denote discourse structure in 
essays. We adapted the conceptual framework of 
conjunctive relations from Quirk. et al(1985) in 
~hich terms, such as "'In summary" and "'In 
conclusion," which we consider to be surface cue 
terms, are classified as conjuncts used tot 
summarizing. Cue words such as "'perhaps" and 
"'possibly" are considered to be Belief words used by 
the writer to express a belief with regard to argument 
development in essays. Words like "'this" and 
"'these" may often be used to flag that the writer is 
developing on the same topic (Sidner (1986)). We 
also observed that. in certain discourse contexts, non- 
lexicat, syntactic structure cues, such as infinitive or 
complement clauses, may characterize the beginning 
of  a new argument. 
The automated argument partitioning and annotation 
program (APA) was implemented to output a 
discourse-marked annotated version of each essay in 
which the discourse marking is used to indicate new 
arguments (arg_init), or development of an argument 
(arg_dev). An example of APA annotations i shown 
in Figure I.

Sentence I: fl is also assumed that shrinking high 
school enrollment ram, lead to a shortage of qual(fied

AP.4"s heuristic rules for discourse marker annotation 
and argument partitioning are based on syntactic and 
paragraph-based distribution of surface cue words. 
phrases and non-lexical cues corresponding to 
discourse structure. Relevant cue words and terms are 
contained in a specialized surface cue word and phrase 
lexicon. In Figure 1, the annotations. 
arg_init#PARALLEL, and arg_dev#DETAIL indicate 
the rhetorical relations of Parallel structure and Detail 
intbrmation, respectively, in arguments. The 
arg_dev~-SAME_TOPIC label denotes the pronoun "'it" 
as indicating the writer has not changed topics. Tile 
labels arg_in it-C LA I M_THAT and 
arg_dev=CLAIM_THAT indicate that a complement 
clause was used to flag a new argument, or argument 
development. Arg_aux=SPECULATE flags subjunctive 
modals that are believed to indicate a writer's 
speculation. Preliminary analysis of these rules 
indicates that some rule refinements might be useful; 
however, more research needs to be done on this. ~ 
Based on the arg_init flags in the annotated essays, 
.4P.q outputs a version of the essay partitioned "by 
argument". The argument-partitioned versions of  
essays are input to .4rgContent. tile discourse-driven, 
topical analysis program described below. 
2.3 Topical Analysis 
Good essays are relevant o the assigned topic. The}' 
also tend to use a more specialized and precise 
vocabulary in discussing the topic than poorer essays 
do. We should therefore expect a good essay to 
resemble other good essays in its choice of words 
and. conversely, a poor essay to resemble other poor 
ones. E-rater evaluates tile topical content of  an

essay bx comparing the words it contains to the 
words tbund in manually, graded training examples 
tbr each of the six score categories. Two measures of 
content similarity are computed, one based on word 
frequency and the other on word weight, as in 
information retrieval applications (Salton. 1988). For 
the former application (EssayContent). content 
similarit2, is computed over the essay as a ~hole. 
while in the latter application (ArgComem) content 
similarities are computed for each argument in an 
essay. 
For the frequency based measure (the EssavComent 
program), the content of each score category is 
converted to a single vector whose elements 
represent he total frequency of each word in the 
training essays for that category. In effect, this 
merges the essays for each score. (A stop list of some 
function words is removed prior to vector 
construction.) The system computes cosine 
correlations between the vector for a given test essay 
and the six vectors representing the trained 
categories: the category that is most similar to the test 
essay is assigned as the evaluation of its content. An 
advantage of using the cosine correlation is that it is 
not sensitive to essay length, which ma3 vary' 
considerably. 
The other content similarity measure..4rgContem, is 
computed separatel3, for each argument in the test 
essay and is based on the kind of term weighting 
used in information retrieval. For this purpose, the 
word frequency vectors for the six score categories. 
described above, are converted to vectors of word 
weights. The ~eight for word i in score category s is: 
W,,  = 
(freq,. '  max freq,) * Iog(n essays:,~,,,,'nessays, l 
where freq,~ is the frequency of word i in category s. 
max_freq~ is the frequency of the most frequent word 
in x (after a stop list of  words has been removed). 
n_essays,o,., is the total number of training essays 
across all six categories, and n_essays, is the number 
of  training essays containing word i. 
The first part of the weight formula represents the 
prominence of word i in the score category, and the 
second part is the log of the word's inverse document 
frequency (IDF). For each argument a in the test 
essay, a vector of  word weights is also constructed. 
The weight for ~ord i in argument a is 
(freq,,;max_freq,0 * Iog(n_essays,o,,,/n_essays,) 
where freq, ~ is the frequency of  word i in argument a. 
and max_freq, is the frequency of  the most frequent 
word in a (once again, after a stop list of  words has 
been removed). Each argument (as it has been 
partitioned by APA) is evaluated by computing 
cosine correlations between its weighted vector and 
those of the six score categories, and the most similar 
category is assigned to the argument. As a result of  
this analysis, e-rater has a set of scores (one per 
argument) for each test essay. 
We were curious to find out if an essay containing 
several good arguments (each with scores of  5 or 6) 
and several poor arguments (each with scores o f  1 or 
2) produced a different overall judgment by the 
human raters than an essay consisting of  uniformly 
mediocre arguments (3"s or 4"s). or if perhaps 
humans were most influenced by the best or poorest 
argument in the essay. In a preliminary study, we 
looked at how well the minimum, maximum, mode. 
median, and mean of the set of  argument scores 
agreed with the judgments of  human raters for the 
essay as a whole. The mode and the mean showed 
good agreement with human raters, but the greatest 
agreernent was obtained from an adjusted mean of 
the argument scores which compensated for an effect 
of the number of arguments in the essay. For 
example, essays which contained only one or two 
arguments tended to receive slightly lower scores 
from the human raters than the mean of the argument 
scores, and essays which contained many arguments 
tended to receive slightly higher scores than the mean 
of tile argument scores. To compensate for this, an 
adjusted mean is used as e-rater's ArgContent.

3. Training and Testing 
In all. e-rater's syntactic, discourse, and topical 
analyses yielded a total of 57 features for each essay. 
The majority of the features in the overall feature set 
are discourse-related (see Table 3 for some 
examples). To predict the score assigned by human 
raters, a stepwise linear regression analysis was used 
to compute the optimal weights for these predictors 
based on manually scored training essays. The 
training sets for each test question consisted of  a total 
18 
of 270 essays. 5 essays for score 0:, 15 essays for 
score I (a rating infrequently used by the human 
raters) and 50 essays each for scores 2 through 6. 
After training, e-rater analyzed new test essays, and 
the regression weights were used to combine the 
measures into a predicted score for each one. E-toter 
predictions were compared to the two human rater 
scores to measure xact and adjacent agreement (see 
Table 1). Figure 2 shows the predictive feature set

Table 2 shows that scores generated by ArgContent 
have higher agreement with human raters than do 
scores generated by Essaa'Content. This suggests that 
the discourse structures generated by APA are useful 
for score prediction, and that the application of 
content vector analysis to text partitioned into smaller 
units of discourse might improxe e-rater's overall 
storing accuracy.

Results tbr the essay questions in Tables I and 2 
represent a wide variety of topics. (Sample questions 
that show topical variety in GMAT essays can be 
viewed at http://www.gmat.org/. Topical variety in 
TWE questions can be reviewed at 
http://www.toefl.org/tstprpmt.html.) The data also 
represented a wide range of English writing 
competency. The majority of test-takers from the 
two TWE data sets were nonnative English speakers. 
Despite these differences in topic and writing skill, e- 
rater, as well as EssayContenr and ArgContent 
performed consistently across items. In fact. over the 
15 essay questions, the discourse t~atures output by 
APA and scores output by ArgContent (based on 
discourse-chunked text) account for the majority of 
the most frequently occurring predictive features. 
These are shown in Table 3. 
We believe that the discourse related features used by 
e-rater might be the most useful building blocks for 
automated generation of diagnostic and instructional 
sumnaaries about essays. For example, sentences 
indicated as "'the beginning of an argument" could be 
used to flag main points of an essay (Marcu (1997)). 
ArgContent's ability to generate "'scores" for each 
argument could provide information about the 
relevance of individual arguments in an essay, which 
in turn could be used to generate helpful diagnostic 
or instructional information.

4. Discussion and Conclusions 
The study indicates that discourse, syntactic, and 
topical information can be reliably used for machine 
prediction of essay scores. The results uggest that e- 
ruter's discourse marking is informative to the 
scoring process. ArgContenr the statistical, topical 
discourse analyzer, appears to be the most predictive 
feature. Other highly ranked features include surface 
cue words and non-lexical discourse cues.
