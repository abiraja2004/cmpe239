Abstract
A number of approaches have been taken
to improve lexical consistency in Statis-
tical Machine Translation. However, lit-
tle has been written on the subject of
where and when to encourage consistency.
I present an analysis of human authored
translations, focussing on words belong-
ing to different parts-of-speech across a
number of different genres.
1 Introduction
Writers are often given mixed messages with re-
spect to word choice. On one hand they are en-
couraged to vary their use of words (in essay writ-
ing): ?It is also important that the words you use
are varied, so that you aren?t using the same words
again and again.?1. On the other hand they are
encouraged to use the same words (only chang-
ing the determiner) when referring to the same en-
tity a second time (in technical writing): ?The first
time a single countable noun is introduced, use a.
Thereafter, when referring to that same item, use
the.? 2.
Halliday and Hassan (1976) showed that well-
written documents exhibit lexical cohesion in
terms of what they call reiteration and colloca-
tion. Reiteration is achieved via repetition as well
as the use of synonyms and hypernyms. A collo-
cation is a sequence of words / terms that co-occur
regularly in text. Examples of collocated pairs of
words include ?fast food?, ?bright idea? and ?nu-
clear family?. Any source language document will

therefore contain repeated instances of the same
words or lemmas (morphological variants of the
same words). This repeated use of words and lem-
mas is known as lexical consistency and the in-
stances can be grouped together to form lexical
chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991). Lexical chains
were proposed by Lotfipour-Saedi (1997) as one
feature of a text via which translational equiva-
lence between source and target could be mea-
sured.
While Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
has gone from ignoring these properties of dis-
course by translating sentences independently, to
trying to impose lexical consistency at a universal
level, both approaches have given little consider-
ation to what might be standard practice among
human translators.
In order to discover what the standard practice
might be, and thus what an SMT system might bet-
ter aim to achieve, I have carried out a detailed
analysis of lexical consistency in human transla-
tion. For comparison, I also present an analysis of
translations produced by an SMT system. I have
considered a variety of genres, as genre correlates
with the function of a text, which in turn predicts
its important elements. A preliminary conclusion
of this analysis is that human translators use lex-
ical consistency to support what is important in a
text.

2.1 Unique Terms and Lexical Consistency
Intuitively, it seems obvious that specialised,
?semantically heavy? words like ?genome? and
?hypochondria? will only have a single exact
translation into any given target language, and as
such will tend to be translated with greater consis-
tency than semantically ?light? words. Melamed
(1997) showed that this intuition could be quan-
tified using the concept of entropy, which the
10
author uses over a large corpus to show what
words and what parts-of-speech are more likely to
be translated consistently than others. However,
Melamed?s analysis ignores any segmentation of
the corpus by document, topic, speaker/writer or
translator, considering only overall translational
distributions. It is therefore similar to that which
can be gleaned from the phrase table in a modern
SMT system.
2.2 Enforcing and Encouraging Consistency
A number of approaches have been taken to both
encourage and enforce lexical consistency in SMT.
These range from the cache-based model ap-
proaches of Tiedemann (2010a; 2010b) and Gong
et al (2011), to the post-editing approach of Xiao
et al (2011) and discriminative learning approach
of Ma et al (2011) and He et al (2011).
Carpuat (2009) and Ture et al (2012) suggested
that the one sense per discourse constraint (Gale
et al, 1992) might apply as well to one sense per
translation. Both demonstrated that exploiting this
constraint in SMT led to better quality transla-
tions. Ture et al (2012) encourage consistency
themselves using soft constraints implemented as
additional features in a hierarchical phrase-based
translation model.
What has not been adequately addressed in the
available MT literature is where and when lexical
consistency is desirable in translation.
2.3 Measuring Consistency
In contrast with entropy following from lexical
properties of words (i.e. how many senses a word
has, and how many different possible ways there
are of translating each sense in a given target lan-
guage), as explored in (Melamed, 1997), Itagaki et
al (2007) developed a way to measure the termi-
nological consistency of a single document. They
define consistency as a measure of the number of
translation variations for a term and the frequency
for each variation. They adapted the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) measure, typically used
to measure market concentration, to measure the
consistency of a single term in a single document.
HHI is defined as:
HHI =
n?
i=1
s2i
Where i ranges over the n different ways that the
given term has been translated in the document,
and si is the ratio of the number of times the term
has been translated as i to the number of times it
has been translated. The lower the index, the more
variation there is in translation of the term, i.e. the
less consistent the translation. The maximum in-
dex is 10,000 (or 1 using the normalised scale) for
a completely consistent translation.
HHI is best illustrated with examples of dis-
tributions over a single document. An English
word with two French translations that are ob-
served with equal frequency will receive a score
of: 0.502 +0.502 = 0.5. A different English word
with two French translations observed 80% and
20% of the time will receive a score of: 0.902 +
0.102 = 0.82 representing a more consistent trans-
lation of the English word. When the number
of possible French translations increases, the HHI
score will likely decrease unless one translation is
much more frequent - see previous example. An
English word with three translations observed with
equal frequency (33.3% each) will have a score of:
0.332 +0.332 +0.332 = 0.33 representing a word
that is translated with lower consistency.
Itagaki et al incorporate these HHI scores (one
score per term, per document) in a wider calcula-
tion that measures inter-document consistency of
a set of documents that all use the same term. As
the analyses presented in this paper are concerned
with single documents and their translations, the
per term, per document HHI scores are sufficient.
3 Methodology
This section describes analyses of manual (hu-
man) translation and automated translation (by
a phrase-based SMT system). The data used
is described in Section 3.1 and the methods for
analysing consistency in human and automated
translation are described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
3.1 Data
As the focus of the analysis is lexical consistency,
it was important to select texts that were writ-
ten/translated by the same author. The typical
corpora used in training SMT systems were dis-
missed; Europarl as speakers change frequently
and news-crawl as the articles are typically too
short to exhibit much lexical repetition. Instead
I selected the INTERSECT corpus (Salkie, 2010)
which contains a collection of sentence-aligned
parallel texts from different genres. From this cor-
pus I extracted a number of texts from the English-

French collection (Table 1). The frequencies for
nouns (N), adjectives (A) and verbs (V) in this ta-
ble were extracted automatically using the Tree-
Tagger tool (Schmid, 1994).
Word alignments for the parallel documents
were computed using Giza++ (Och and Ney,
2003) run in both directions. In order to improve
the robustness of the word alignments the doc-
uments were concatenated into a single file, to-
gether with English-French parallel data from the
Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). The word align-
ments for the relevant documents were then ex-
tracted from the symmetrised alignment file.
3.2 Consistency in Human Translation
The motivation for this analysis was to assess the
extent to which a human translator maintained lex-
ical consistency when translating a document. In
other words, in those places where the author of a
source document makes consistent lexical choices,
do human translators do so as well? And if they
do, should we aim for the same in SMT?
For each document, the English and French
parallel texts were processed using TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1994). Using the language in which
the document was originally written (its born lan-
guage) as the source language, word alignments
were used to identify what each source word
aligned to in the (human) translation.
Since I wanted to establish not just the degree
of consistency, but where consistency was being
maintained, and because I felt that the Part-of-
Speech (POS) tags output by TreeTagger were
too fine-grained for this purpose, these tags were
mapped to a set of coarse-grained tags. The
Universal POS tagset mapping file (Petrov et al,
2011) was used for English and a comparable file
was constructed for French. In addition to this, I
also sub-divided the coarse-grained verb class into
three classes: light verbs (e.g. do, have, make),
mid-range verbs (e.g. build, read, speak) and rare-
verbs (e.g. revolutionise, obfuscate, perambulate).
This was to test the hypothesis that light verbs
will exhibit lower levels of consistency than other
verbs. A light verb is defined a verb with little se-
mantic content of its own that forms a predicate
with its argument (usually a noun). For example
the verb ?do? in ?do lunch? or ?make? in ?make
a request?. As no predefined lists of light, mid-
range and rare verbs are available, these groups
were approximated. An English verb?s category
is determined by its frequency in the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (Clear, 1993). A verb with
a frequency count in the bottom 5% is deemed a
rare verb, in the top 5% is deemed a light verb
and anything in between, is deemed a mid-range
verb. A manual inspection of the resulting cat-
egory boundaries shows that these thresholds are
reasonable. For French, verb frequencies were ex-
tracted from the French Treebank (Abeille? et al,
2000).
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) (Itagaki et
al., 2007) scores were calculated for each surface
word (one score per surface word) in the born
language document. The documents were treated
separately, and no inter-document scores are cal-
culated. These scores tell us how consistent the
translation is into the target language. For words
in the English documents I considered what words
and lemmas were present in the French transla-
tion. Lemmas are included as French verb inflec-
tions may otherwise skew the results. For com-
12
pleteness, lemmas in the English translation of the
French documents are also considered.
For each POS category, an average HHI score
is calculated by taking the sum of the HHI scores
per word and dividing it by the number of words
(for that POS category). Only those words that are
repeated (i.e. appear more than once in the source
document with the same coarse POS category) are
considered. (That is, a word that appeared once
as a mid-range verb, once as a noun and once as
something else, would not be included). A similar
average is calculated for lemmas.
HHI scores are normally presented in the range
of 0 to 10,000. However, for simplicity, the scores
presented in this paper are normalised to between
0 to 1.
3.3 Consistency in Automated Translation
The aim of this analysis was to assess how the con-
sistency in translations produced by an SMT sys-
tem would compare to those by a human translator.
The SMT system was an English-French phrase-
based system trained and tuned using (Moses and)
Europarl data. Its language model was constructed
from the French side of the parallel training cor-
pus. The system was used to translate the born
English source documents (Xerox Manual, On
the Origin of Species, Dracula and The Invisible
Man). Word alignments and a file containing a list
of Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words were also re-
quested from the decoder. Note that all of the doc-
uments are considered to be ?out of domain? with
respect to the training data used to build the SMT
system.
Using a similar process as described in Section
3.2, but omitting those words that are reported by
the decoder as OOV, average HHI scores are cal-
culated for each POS category. OOV words are
omitted as these will be ?carried through? by the
decoder, appearing untranslated in the translation
output. They therefore do not say anything about
the consistency of the translation.
The other major difference is that HHI scores
are calculated only at the word level, not at the
lemma level as it is expected that the TreeTagger
would perform poorly on SMT output and these
errors could lead to misleading results. In all other
respects, the process for analysing text is the same
as described in Section 3.2.
4 Results
4.1 Consistency in Human Translation
The results are presented in Table 2. Higher (aver-
age) HHI scores represent greater consistency.
For both English and French source documents,
nouns score highly, suggesting that in general hu-
man translators translate nouns rather consistently.
However, nouns don?t always receive the highest
average score. For verbs, the trend is that consis-
tency is irrelevant in translating light verbs, rare
verbs tend to be translated with the highest consis-
tency, and mid-range verbs are somewhere in be-
tween. This suggests that consistency in the trans-
lation of light verbs would be undesirable.
Looking at some of the texts in more detail it
may be possible to infer certain qualities of text
across different genres.
Novels: In all three texts, (Dracula, The
Invisible Man and The Immoralist), nouns receive
the highest average HHI score of all the POS
categories. An analysis of some of the most
frequent (and aligned) nouns in Dracula (Table
3) suggests that it is desirable to keep important
nouns constant - those that identify characters and
other entities central to the story. For example,
the Count is an important character and is never
referred to by any other name/title in the original
text. (N.B. ?count? is also a mid-range verb, but it
is used only as a noun in Dracula). The translation
to (le) comte in French is highly consistent. A
similar observation is made for horses which are
important in the story. Interestingly, the (same)
coach driver is referred to as (le) chauffer, (le)
conducteur and (le) cocher in French:
English: ...and the driver said in excellent German
French: Le conducteur me dit alors, en excellent allemand
English: Then the driver cracked his whip
French: Puis le chauffeur fit claquer son fouet
English: When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down
French: La cale`che arre?te?e, le cocher sauta de son sie`ge
This perhaps reflects a stylistic choice made by the
translator to vary the terms used to refer to a char-
acter of lesser importance. It is worth noting that
the English text also contains several instances of
?coachman? to refer to the ?driver? but the varia-
tion is much less compared with the French trans-
lation.
Verbs, on the other hand, receive lower (aver-
age) HHI scores indicating that this may be an area

Table 3: Dracula - most frequent noun words
in which some artistic license may be used.
These findings suggest that when aiming to en-
courage consistency in the translation of novels,
the focus should be on nouns. As for adjectives,
less frequent in novels than verbs and nouns (Table
1), further analysis may show whether consistency
varies depending on function (e.g. modifier, pred-
icate adjective) or frequency as well. The transla-
tion of pronouns also requires investigation.
Natural Science: The natural science text On
the Origin of Species exhibits a similar pattern of
translational consistency to novels. This is perhaps
not surprising as 19th century British natural sci-
ence texts would have had the same middle-class
audience as the novels of the same era. The trans-
lation of modern scientific texts may or may not
follow this pattern.
Instruction Manuals: In the Xerox Manual
nouns receive the highest average HHI score at
the word level. When considering what lemmas
the source words align to in the translation, nouns
again score the highest, closely followed by adjec-
tives and rare verbs. This overall pattern makes
sense as in an instruction manual it is important to
identify both the actions and entities involved at
each step. Adjectives will help the user correctly
identify the intended entities. The word-level HHI
scores for the most frequently used (and aligned)
rare verbs are given in Table 4.
The verb process has several translations in
French: traitement (?treatment?/?processing?),
traiter (?process?) and exe?cuter (?execute?).
(Note that traitement is in fact a noun, reflecting
a change in the structure of the sentence.) The

Table 4: Xerox Manual - most frequent rare verb

resulting translations into French are all clear, so
this may simply be a reflection of a difference in
terminology between English and French, at least
as used by Xerox. For example:
English: Process the page and save the output as an image.
French: Traitement de la page et sauvegarde de la sortie
comme image.
English: Page Settings enable you to describe the pages that
the system is about to process.
French: Les Instructions de page vous permettent de de?crire
les pages que le syste`me va traiter.
English: Load Verification Data, Loads a named verification
data file to process a job.
French: Charger donne?es de ve?rification, Charge un fichier
nomme? de donne?es de ve?rification pour exe?cuter une ta?che.
What is also interesting is that in the English text,
the word process is used as both a noun and a rare
verb. However, it is translated more consistently
when used as a verb (HHI: 0.5729) compared with
its use as a noun (HHI: 0.2576).
In this genre, accuracy and readability are im-
portant and it is acceptable to produce a ?repeti-
tive? or ?boring? text. It may, therefore, be ap-
propriate to encourage translational consistency of
nouns, rare verbs and adjectives in instructions.
Unlike with novels, it would make sense that all
entities in an instruction manual are of importance.
Public Information: In the French Revolution
to 1945 and Nuclear Testing documents, adjectives
score highest, followed by nouns. Word-level HHI
scores for the most frequent (and aligned) adjec-
tives in the French Revolution to 1945 document
are presented in Table 5.
Using a manual inspection of those nouns that
appear next to (i.e. directly after) the adjective in
French, the possibility that these nouns were se-
mantically light was explored. Focussing on the
English translation, WordNet (Miller, 1995) was
used to ascertain the distance of the noun from the
root of the relevant hierarchy. The assumption is
Adjective (word) HHI score Count
nationale (national) 0.8233 75
europe?enne (European) 0.8232 64
e?conomique (economic) 0.8575 40
constitutionnel (constitutional) 0.9474 37
franc?aise (French) 0.4288 37
constitutionnelle (constitutional) 1.0000 31
franc?ais (French) 0.7899 26
autres (other) 0.8496 25
Table 5: French Revolution to 1945 - most fre-
quent adjective words
the semantically light nouns appear closer to the
root than other nouns. For all 82,115 noun synsets
in WordNet, the average minimum and maximum
depths to the root are 7.25 and 7.70 respectively.
Taking the adjective economic (e?conomique in
French) in the French Revolution to 1945 docu-
ment as an example, the nouns it is paired with
(e.g. expansion, cooperation, development, ac-
tion, council, etc.) typically have depths below
the average and therefore could be considered se-
mantically light. The adjectives used in the text
include constitutionnel / constitutionnelle (?con-
stitutional?), e?conomique (?economic?) and na-
tionale (?national?). These words are rather spe-
cific (or ?semantically heavy?), so there may be
few alternative valid translations to choose from.
This is supported by Melamed?s (1997) notion of
semantic entropy, in which more specific words re-
ceive lower entropy scores, reflecting greater con-
sistency in translation. For texts of this genre, it
may be appropriate to encourage the consistent
translation of adjectives and nouns, allowing for
more freedom in the translation of verbs.
News Articles: The pattern for news articles is
a little less predictable, although a similar pattern
(to other document types) can be seen for light,
mid-range and rare verbs. This may be due to the
short length of the texts (circa 2,000 words) which
may not be sufficient to establish a stable pattern.
Or it may be that there are different writing styles
within the news genre dependent on the type or
subject of the ?story?.
4.2 Consistency in Automated Translation
The results of a similar analysis of translational
consistency in phrase-based SMT are presented in
Table 6. Overall, consistency is much higher than
in translations produced by human translators. But
what does this mean? Is the problem of consis-
tency in SMT non-existent? In short, no; there are

Table 6: Automated Translation: Average HHI scores taken for words in automated translations as com-
pared with the scores from human translations. Scores are provided in the range of 0 to 1
still areas in which consistency is a real problem,
but one needs to look more closely at the data to
find the problems.
Any consistency in the output of an SMT sys-
tem will be accidental, and not by design. It is a
reflection of the data that the system was trained
with and represents the ?best? choice for translat-
ing a word or phrase, as determined by scores from
the phrase table and language model. Carpuat
and Simard (2012) suggest that consistency in the
source side local context may be sufficient to con-
strain the phrase table and language model to pro-
duce consist translations. It is also important to
note that the outcome is very much dependent
on the system used to perform the translation.
Carpuat and Simard (2012) suggest that weaker
SMT systems (i.e. those that report lower BLEU
scores) may be more consistent than their stronger
counterparts due to fewer translation options.
There are several possibilities. A word in the
source language may be translated:
? Completely consistently (HHI = 1);
? Very inconsistently (HHI ? 0);
? or anywhere in between
Additionally, a translation that is deemed to be
completely consistent may be either correct or in-
correct. With humans, we assume the translation
output to be of a high standard but we cannot as-
sume the same of an SMT system.
Examples of completely consistent translations
are horses as ?chevaux?, man as ?homme? and
nails as ?clous?. All are taken from Dracula.
While horses and man are translated correctly,
?clous? is an incorrect translation of nails which
the context of the novel refer to Dracula?s finger-
nails. ?ongles? would have been the correct trans-
lation. The word ?clous? is typically used in the
sense of nails used in construction. This is an ex-
ample of a translation that could result either from
lack of sufficient local context (for disambigua-
tion) or because ?ongles? is not present in the data
the SMT system was trained on.
Examples of inconsistent translations are for the
body parts arm and hand in the text of Drac-
ula. arm is translated either correctly as ?bras?
(arm, body part) or incorrectly as ?armer? (the
verb ?to arm?). hand is translated correctly as
?main? (?hand?) and incorrectly as co?te? (?side?)
and ?part? (?portion?). In both cases, the correct
translation was available to the system and a more
accurate translation could have been obtained had
the correct translation been identified and its con-
sistency encouraged.
Ambiguous words in particular can cause trou-
ble for SMT systems. There are many words that
can function as both a verb and a noun, e.g. pro-
cess and count. Local context might not always
be sufficient to provide the correct disambigua-
tion, resulting in opportunities for incorrect trans-
lations.
An example of where an ambiguous word
results in problems is in the translation of
count (i.e. Count Dracula) as: omitted (4),
?compter? (21), ?compatage? (2), ?comte? (1) and
?de?pouillement? (5). The only acceptable transla-
tion from this set is ?comte?. As for the reaming
options: ?compte? and ?comptage? are both verbs
meaning ?to count? and ?de?pouillement? is a noun
meaning ?starkness?, ?austerity? or ?analysis? (of
data).
5 Conclusion
The analysis of human translation presented in this
paper is a first attempt to understand where and
when it might be appropriate to encourage con-
sistency in an SMT system. I consider genre as
the where and parts-of-speech as the when, but
other interpretations are also possible. On the
whole, it seems reasonable to encourage the con-
16
sistent translation of nouns, across all genres. In
addition, encouraging consistency in the transla-
tion of rare verbs and adjectives for technical doc-
uments and of adjectives for public information
documents may also prove beneficial.
With respect to verbs, variation in verb consis-
tency has been shown to correlate with frequency
(as a proxy to identify light and rare verbs). Given
the low consistency with which humans translate
light verbs, encouraging their consistency in auto-
mated translation would be undesirable.
Automated translation may look very consis-
tent on the surface, but it is necessary to look be-
yond this to see the errors. While humans may
make inconsistent translations, we trust that these
inconsistencies will not confuse or mislead the
reader. SMT systems on the other hand gener-
ate their translations based on statistics that say
what the ?best choice? might be, both at the
word/phrase level (through the phrase table) and
overall (through the language model). Further-
more, they do nothing to guarantee consistency -
this occurs by chance, whether desirable or not.
As a result, inconsistencies may arise that make
the translations difficult to read. These inconsis-
tencies are not predictable and could occur in any
SMT system.
6 Future Work
The findings presented in this paper are sugges-
tive but only a small number of texts have been
included for each genre. The analysis could be
extended to include a larger set of documents and
different language pairs (the only requirement is
for a POS tagger for the source language). Multi-
ple translations of the same document could also
be considered to identify whether similar patterns
can be observed for different translators.
There are a number of possible ways in which
to use this information to inform the design of a
SMT system. I have shown that SMT systems
are capable of highly consistent translations but
this consistency cannot be guaranteed and there
is the possibility that the translations will be con-
sistent and incorrect. Also, Carpuat and Simard
(2012) have shown that inconsistent translations
in SMT often indicate translation errors. A sys-
tem which encourages translations which are both
consistent and correct (or at least acceptable) for
words that belong to a predefined set (e.g. by POS
tag) is desirable. This ?encouragement? could be
achieved using rewards delivered via feature func-
tions or within n-best list re-ranking ? hypothe-
ses which make re-use of the same translation(s)
for repetitions of the same source word would be
ranked higher than those that introduced incon-
sistencies. Revisiting the cache-based models of
(2010a; 2010b) and Gong et al (2011) could pro-
vide a possible starting point.
The initial focus could be on nouns, which are
translated by human translators with high consis-
tency for all genres. Many nouns are used either to
specify entities that are only mentioned once in a
text (essentially setting the scene for more promi-
nent entities), or as ?predicate nominals? on those
more prominent entities (e.g. in ?...is a horrific
story?). However, other nouns occur within the
Noun Phrases (NPs) that make up part of a corefer-
ence chain, of subsequent reference to prominent
entities.
As an extension to this work I will aim to inves-
tigate the consistency of translation of those nouns
that belong to coreference chains and ultimately,
to build a system that makes use of the resulting in-
formation. Work has already started to construct a
parallel corpus in which coreference chains are an-
notated so that the translation of coreference (both
NPs and pronouns) may be studied in more depth.
Another question worth considering is whether
it would be desirable to replicate aspects of low
consistency in human translation by encouraging
inconsistent (but still acceptable) translations of
certain words or word categories. My instinct is
that this could lead to translations that better ap-
proximate those produced by humans.
