ABSTRACT 
The algorithm takes as only input a llst of 
words, preferably but not necessarily in phonemic 
transcription, in any two putatively related 
languages, and sorts it into decreasing order of 
probable cognatlon. The processing of a 250-1tem 
bilingual list takes about five seconds of CPU time 
on a DEC KLI091, and requires 56 pages of core 
memory. The algorithm is given no information 
whatsoever about the phonemic transcription .used, 
and even though cognate identi f icat ion is carried 
out on the basis of a context-free one-for-one 
matching of indivldual characters, its cognation 
decisions are bettered by a trained linguist using 
more information only in cases of wordllsts sharing 
less than 40% cognates and involving complex, 
mu\]tlple sound correspondences. 
I FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURES 
A. Identifying Sound Correspondences 
Consider the following wordllst from two 
hypothetical Austronesian-llke ivnguages: 
Titla Sese 
"eye" mats nas 
"sea" tasi sah 
"father" tams san 
"mother" mama nan 
"tongue" miml nen 
"shellfish" slsl hehe 
"bad" satl has 
"to stand" tl se 
"to come" me na 
"with" ml ne 
"not" sa ha 
Take the first word pair, mata/nas.  We base 
no information about the phonetic values of their 
constituent characters, we do not know whether the 
same system of transcription was used in both 
wordllsts: for all we know "a" might denotes a high 
back rounded vowel in Tit~a and a uvular trill in 
Sese. The only assumption allowed is that in each 
word llst the same characters represent, more or 
less, the same sounds. Under this assumption, the 
possibility that any one character of a member of a 
word pair may correspond to any character of the 
other member cannot be discarded. Thus in the pair 
mata/nas Titia "m" may correspond to Sese "n", "a", 
or "s", and so may Titia "a", "t", "s", and "s". 
We summarize the evidence for these 
possible correspondences in an TxS matrix, where 
T is the number of different characters found in 
the Titla wordllst, S that in the Sese wordllst. 
Thus the evidence afforded by the first pair, 
mats/has:

Matrix A (observed frequencies) 
If character correspondences between tbe 
Titla and Sese word pairs were random the expected 
frequency e\[i,J\] of recorded possible correspon- 
448 
dences between the ith character of the Tltla 
alphabet and the jth of the Sese alphabet would be:  
e\[i ,J\] - 
sum of ith row x sum of Jth column 
sum of cells 
giving a matrix of expected frequencies of possible 
sound correspondences:

Matr ix  B (expected frequencies) 
Note how the six character correspondences 
wlth the greatest d i f fe rences  between observed and 
expected frequencies give the simple substitution 
code used for generating Seat words from pseudo- 
Austroneslan Titla: 
T i t ta  Sese Observed - Expected 
m n 5.84 
s h 4.48 
i e 3.36 
a a 3.28 
t s 2.48 
B. Identifying Null Correspondences 
Call the difference between the observed 
and the expected frequency of a character corres- 
pondence i t s  weight (s much l ess  primitive 
definition of weight is used In the actual 
implementation). 
Take the first word palr (mats/has) and 
enter into a 4x3 matrix W the wel~hts of its 12 
poss ib le  character  cor respondences :  
n a s 
m 5.84 -0.28 -1.96 
a 1.16 3.28 0.96 
t -1.92 0.64 2.48 
a 1.16 3.28 0.96 
Matr ix  W (weights) 
Call potential of a character correspon- 
dence the sum of its weight and of the highest 
potential of all possible character correspondences 
to its right, i.e. 
Pot(i,J) = W\[I,J\] + max(Pot(i+l..m,J+l..n)) 
giving the matrix of potentials P for word pair 
mata/nafl : 
n a a 
m 11.60 2.28 -1.96 
a 4.44 5.76 0.96 
t 1.36 1.60 2.48 
a 1.16 3.28 0.96 
Matrix P (petentlals) 
The character correspondence with  the 
blghest potential is here m/n (P\[I,I\]-II.6). Of its 
poss ib le  successors, that with the  highest 
potentlal is a/a (P\[2,2\]ffiS.76), itself followed by 
t / s  (P \ [3 ,3 \ ] -2 .48) ,  which has no pass ib le  successor .  
Thus we have:  
T i t ia  Sese Potent ia l  
m n 11.60 
a a 5.76 
t s 2.48 
a zero 
The same procedure applied to the rest of 
the wordllst gives the proper matches, Tltla flnals 
in polysyllabic words having been deleted when 
deriving the corresponding Sese words. 
C. A Relative Measure of Cognatlon 
Call index of cognatlon the maximum 
potentlal of a word palr divided by its number of 
cor respondences ,  including null cor respondences .  
Thus in  the f i c t i t ious  case o f  T t t ia  and Sese tbe 
index  o f  cognat ton  o f  the pa i r  mats/has i s  2 .9  ( i t s  
maximum potent ia l ,  11.60,  d iv ided  by the number o f  
cor respondences ,  4 ) .  Word pa i rs  w i th  h igh  cognat ion  
indices are foun~ to  be more often genetically 
related than pairs with  low cognatlon indices.

A. Weights. 
The difference between observed and 
expected frequencies does not provide a 
satisfactory measurement of the weight of a 
posslble character correspondence. Several 
alternative measurements were tested, out of whlcb 
standardized scores were retained: the weight of a 
character correspondence was redefined as the 
449 
probabillty of the discrepancy between its observed 
and expected frequencies of occurrence not beJng 
due to chance, expressed as a z score. Where 
absolute frequencies of 20 and less are involved 
the exact probabillty is calculated and translated 
into a z score using a polynomial approximation 
(Abramowitz and Stegun 1970). 
B. Vowel/Consonant Correspondences 
Disallowing correspondences between vowels 
and consonants vastly improved the performance of 
the algorltbm. No human intervention is needed to 
identify vowels from consonants, an improved 
version of an algorithm described in Suhotln 1962 
being used to identify characters which represent 
vowel sounds. Whether consonants should be allowed 
to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the 
current implementation. 
C. Iterations 
Performance is again improved when word 
pairs showing individual character matches as 
computed from matrices of potentlals (section IB 
above) are reprocessed. The weights of possible 
character correspondences are recomputed. This 
time, however, only characters in the same 
positions in the two words are scored as possible 
correspondences. Thus for instance, the first pass 
of the algorithm having matched the "m" of "mata" 
to the "n" of "nas", Titla "m" is scored in the 
second pass as corresponding possibly only to Sese 
"n". Sequences of alternate null correspondences 
are collapsed so as not to preclude the 
identification of correspondences which might have 
been missed in the first pass, e.g. a pair mat/mot 
matched in the first pass as 
m m 
zero o 
a zero 
t t 
is relnput in the second pass as 
m m 
a o 
t t 
Weights of possible character correspon- 
dences having thus been recomputed, a new matrix of 
potentials and a new cognatlon index is computed 
for each word pair. Further iterations were found 
to yield negligible improvements to the results 
obtained. 
D. Improved Weights and Cognation Indices 
Frequent character correspondences often 
yield very high z scores (up to 1@.2). The presence 
of even one such hl~h score in a word pair often 
invalidates the character-matchlng procedure. A 
number of alternative alterations to the definition 
of weight were tried, out of which the simplest 
proved best: weights beyond an arbitrary value are 
set to that value. Practice showed a maximum value 
of 3.0 to 4.0 to give the best results. This is not 
surprlsing, since there is Do significant 
difference in the degrees of certainty 
corresponding to z scores of 4 and beyond. 
The last improvement in the performance of 
the algorithm to date was brought by a redefinition 
of the cognatlon index. Once the individual 
character  matches of  a word pa i r  have been 
identified from its matrix of potentials their 
weights are adjusted as follows: 
I) Positive weights less tban 1.28 (corresponding 
to a 90% significance level) are set to zero; 
negative weights and weights greater than 1.28 are 
left unchanged. 
2) Positive weights of character-to-zero matches 
are set to zero; negative weights are left 
unchanged. 
The cognatlon index is then defined as the 
sum of the adjusted weights divided by the number 
of matches, e.g. (an actual example from two 
languages of Vanuatu): 
Weight 
Origlnal Adjusted 
x zero -0.64 
a a 3.98 
h D 1.06 
a zero 2.12 
t D 3.12 
i I 2.86 
a zero 2.12 
Cognatlon index: 9.32/8

0.00 
3.12

9.32 
= 1.165 
III PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM 
The algorithm as described has been 
implemented in Simula 67 on a DEC ELI091 and 
applied to a corpus of some 300 words in 75 
languages and dialects of Vanuatu. Results are 
excellent for languages sharing 40% or more 
cognates, even when sound correspondences are 
complex. They deteriorate rapldly when lesser 
proportions of cognates and complex sound 
correspondences are involved, but remain excellent 
when mainly one-to-one correspondences are present. 
Thus for instance Sakao and Tolomako (Espirltu 
Santo, Vanuatu) were given as sharing 38.91~ 
cognates (cut-off cognation index: 1.28), as 
against a human estimate of 41% backed by a full 
knowledge of their dlachronlc phonologles and 
comparisons with other related languages. Out of 
the 50 word pairs with the highest cognation 
indices only two (the 38th and the 45th) were 
deflnltely not cognate and one (the 36th) doubtful. 
Yet, Sakao has undergone extremely complex 
phonological changes, viz.: 
Tolomako Sakao 
"eye" nata m6a 
"throat" tsalo rlo 
"banana" ~eta l i  i~ l  
"to blow" su~i hy 
"nine" I inaratati l~ner~p?~

IV FDRTHER IMPROVEMENTS 
The identification of environment- 
conditioned phonologlcal correspondences is the 
next, most obvious stage in further improving the 
algorithm. This problem has of course been, and is 
being, investigated. Difficulties arise from the 
fact that frequencies of possible correspondences 
in any given environment become too low to be 
handled by statlstlcal tests. Other approaches -- 
inspired from chess-playlng programs -- have been 
tried, but have proved too expensive in computer 
tlme so far. A further, much desirable, improvement 
is the ~dentlfication of rules of metatbesis. The 
solution to this problem appears to be subordinated 
to that of the dlscovery of context-sensitive 
rules. 
V PURPOSE OF THE ALGORITHM 
A billngua\] wordllst is conceptually 
equivalent to a bilingual text: words of a llst to 
sentences of a text, phonemes of s word to 
morphemes of a sentence, cognate pairs to segments 
of the same meaning, non-cognates to segments of 
different meanings, and the algorithm described is 
tbe present state of an attempted solution to the 
much more general fol\]owlng problem: given two 
texts of approximately equal lengths in two 
different languages, determine whether one is the 
translation of tbe other -- or both translations of 
a text in a third language -- wholly or In parts, 
and If so, establish the rules for translating one 
into the other.
