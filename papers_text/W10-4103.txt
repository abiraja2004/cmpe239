Abstract 
Sentence segmentation is a fundamental 
issue in Classical Chinese language 
processing. To facilitate reading and 
processing of the raw Classical Chinese 
data, we propose a statistical method to 
split unstructured Classical Chinese text 
into smaller pieces such as sentences and 
clauses. The segmenter based on the 
conditional random field (CRF) model is 
tested under different tagging schemes 
and various features including n-gram, 
jump, word class, and phonetic informa-
tion. We evaluated our method on four 
datasets from several eras (i.e., from the 
5th century BCE to the 19th century). 
Our CRF segmenter achieves an F-score 
of 83.34% and can be applied on a varie-
ty of data from different eras. 
1 Introduction 
Chinese word segmentation is a well-known and 
widely studied problem in Chinese language 
processing. In Classical Chinese processing, sen-
tence segmentation is an even more vexing issue. 
Unlike English and other western languages, 
there is no delimiter marking the end of the word 
in Chinese. Moreover, not only is there a lack of 
delimiters between the words, almost all pre-
20th century Chinese is written without any 
punctuation marks. Figure 1 shows photocopies 
of printed and hand written documents from the 
19th century. Within any given paragraph, the 
Chinese characters are printed as evenly spaced 
characters, with nothing to separate words from 
words, phrases from phrases, and sentences from 
sentences. Thus, inside a paragraph, explicit 
boundaries of sentences and clauses are lacking. 
In order to understand the structure, readers of 
Classical Chinese have to manually identify 
these boundaries during the reading. This 
process is called Classical Chinese sentence 
segmentation, or Judo (??). 
For example, the opening lines of the Daoist 
classic Zhuangzi originally lacked segmentation: 
 
?/north ?/ocean ?/have?/fish ?/it ?/name 
?/is ?/Kun (a kind of big fish) ?/Kun ?/of 
?/big ?/not ?/know ?/how ?/thousand ?
/mile  ?/exclamation 
 
The meaning of the text is hard to interpret 
without segmentation. Below is the identical text 
as segmented by a human being. It is clearly 
more readable.  
 
????/in the north ocean there is a fish 
???? /its name is Kun 
???/the size of the Kun 
??????/I don?t know how many  
thousand miles the fish is 
 
However, sentence segmentation in Classical 
Chinese is not a trivial problem. Classical Chi-
nese sentence segmentation, like Chinese word 
segmentation, is inherently ambiguous. Individ-
uals generally perform sentence segmentation in 
instinctive ways. To identify the boundaries of 
sentences and clauses, they primarily rely on 
their experience and sense of the language rather 
than on a systematic procedure. It is thus diffi-
cult to construct a set of rules or practical proce-
dures to specify the segmentation of the infinite 
variety of Classical Chinese sentences.

Because of the importance of sentence seg-
mentation, beginning in the 20th century, some 
editions of the Chinese classics have been labor-
intensively segmented and marked with modern 
punctuation. However, innumerable documents 
in Classical Chinese from the centuries of Chi-
nese history remain to be segmented. To aid in 
processing these documents, we propose an au-
tomated Classical Chinese sentence segmenta-
tion approach that enables completion of seg-
mentation tasks quickly and accurately. To con-
struct the sentence segmenter for Classical Chi-
nese, the popular sequence tagging models, con-
ditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al, 
2001), are adopted in this study. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
First, we describe the Classical Chinese sentence 
segmentation problem in Section 2. In Section 3, 
we review the relevant literature, including sen-
tence boundary detection (SBD) and Chinese 
word segmentation. In Section 4, we introduce 
the tagging schemes along with the features, and 
show how the sentence segmentation problem 
can be transformed into a sequence tagging 
problem and decoded with CRFs. In Section 5, 
the experimental setup and data are described. In 
Section 6, we report the experimental results and 
discuss the properties and the challenges of the 
Classical Chinese sentence segmentation prob-
lem. Finally, we conclude the remarks in Section 
7. 
2 Problem Description 
The outcomes of Classical Chinese sentence 
 
segmentation are not well-defined in linguistics 
at present. In general, the results of segmentation 
consist of sentences, clauses, and phrases. For 
instance, in the segmented sentence ???? / 
??? / ?????????, ????? (?the 
mists on the mountains like wild horses?) and 
????? (?the dust in the air?) are phrases, and ?
????????? (?the living creatures blow 
their breaths at each other?) is a clause. A 
sentence such as ?????????? (?I do 
not believe it because it is ridiculous.?) is a short 
sentence itself, and does not require any 
segmentation. For a given text, there is no strict 
rule to determine at which level the 
segmentation should be performed. For instance, 
the opening lines of the Daoist classic Daodejing 
is ?????????????? (?The way 
that can be spoken is not the eternal way. The 
name that can be given is not the eternal name.?) 
which is usually segmented as ???? / ??? 
/ ??? / ????, but may also be segmented 
as ?? / ?? / ??? / ? / ?? / ????. 
Either segmentation is reasonable. 
In this paper, we do not distinguish among the 
three levels of segmentation. Instead, our system 
learns directly from the human-segmented cor-
pus. After training, our system will be adapted to 
perform human-like segmentation automatically. 
Further, we do not distinguish the various out-
comes of Classical Chinese sentence segmenta-
tion. Instead, for the sake of convenience, every 
product of the segmentation process is termed 
?clause? in the following sections. 
  
 
3 Related Work 
Besides Classical Chinese, sentence boundary 
detection (SBD) is also an issue in English and 
other western languages. SBD in written texts 
and speech represents quite different problems. 
For written text, the SBD task is to distinguish 
periods used as the end-of-sentence indicator 
(full stop) from other usages, such as parts of 
abbreviations and decimal points. By contrast, 
the task of SBD in speech is closely related to 
the task of Classical Chinese sentence segmenta-
tion. In speech processing, the outcome of 
speech recognizers is a sequence of words, in 
which the punctuation marks are absence, and 
the sentence boundaries are thus lacking. To re-
cover the syntactic structure of the original 
speech, SBD is required. 
Like Classical Chinese sentence segmentation, 
the task of SBD in speech is to determine which 
of the inter-word boundaries in the stream of 
words should be marked as end-of-sentence, and 
then to divide the entire word sequence into in-
dividual sentences. Empirical methods are com-
monly employed to deal with this problem. Such 
methods involve many different sequence labe-
ling models including HMMs (Shriberg et al, 
2000), maximum entropy (Maxent) models (Liu 
et al, 2004), and CRFs (Liu et al, 2005). 
Among these, a CRF model used in Liu et al
(2005) offered the lowest error rate.  
Chinese word segmentation is a problem 
closely related to Classical Chinese sentence 
segmentation. The former identifies the bounda-
ries of the words in a given text, while the latter 
identifies the boundaries of the sentences, claus-
es, and phrases. In contrast to sentences and 
clauses, the length of Chinese words is shorter, 
and the variety of Chinese words is more limited. 
Despite the minor unknown words, most of the 
frequent words can be handled with a dictionary 
predefined by Chinese language experts or ex-
tracted from the corpus automatically. However, 
it is impossible to maintain a dictionary of the 
infinite number of sentences and clauses. For 
these reasons, the Classical Chinese sentence 
segmentation problem is more challenging. 
Methods of Chinese word segmentation can 
be mainly classified into heuristic rule-based 
approaches, statistical machine learning ap-
proaches, and hybrid approaches. Hybrid ap-
proaches combine the advantages of heuristic 
and statistical approaches to achieve better re-
sults (Gao et al, 2003; Xue, 2003; Peng et al, 
2004). 
Xue (2003) transformed the Chinese word 
segmentation problem into a tagging problem. 
For a given sequence of Chinese characters, the 
author applies a Maxent tagger to assign each 
character one of four positions-of-character 
(POC) tags, and then coverts the tagged se-
quence into a segmented sequence. The four 
POC tags used in Xue (2003) denote the posi-
tions of characters within a word. For example, 
the first character of a word is tagged ?left 
boundary?, the last character of a word is tagged 
?right boundary?, the middle character of a word 
is tagged ?middle?, and a single character that 
forms a word by itself is tagged ?single-
character-word?. Once the given sequence is 
tagged, the boundaries of words are also re-
vealed, and the task of segmentation becomes 
straightforward. However, the Maxent models 
used in Xue (2003) suffer from an inherent the 
label bias problem. Peng et al(2004) uses the 
CRFs to address this issue. The tags used in 
Peng et al(2004) are of only two types, ?start? 
and ?non-start?, in which the ?start? tag denotes 
the first character of a word, and the characters 
in other positions are given the ?non-start? tag. 
The closest previous works to Classic Chinese 
sentence segmentation are Huang (2008) and 
Zhang et al (2009). Huang combined the Xue?s 
tagging scheme (i.e., 4-tag set) and CRFs to ad-
dress the Classical Chinese sentence segmenta-
tion problem and reported an F-score of 80.96% 
averaged over various datasets. A similar work 
by Zhang et al reported an F-score of 71.42%.  
4 Methods 
Conditional random field is our tagging model, 
and the implementation is CrfSgd 1.31 provided 
by L?on Bottou. As denoted by the tool name, 
the parameters in this implementation are opti-
mized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
which convergences much faster than the com-
mon optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS 
and conjugate gradient (Vishwanathan, et al, 
2006). To construct the sentence segmenter on

CRF, the tagging scheme and the feature func-
tions play the crucial roles.  
4.1 Tagging Schemes 
In the previous works (Huang, 2008; Zhang et 
al., 2009), POC tags used in Chinese word seg-
mentation (Xue, 2003) are converted to denote 
the positions of characters within a clause. The 
4-tag set is redefined as L (?the left boundary of 
a clause?), R (?the right boundary of a clause?), 
M (?the middle character of a clause?), and S (?a 
single character forming a clause?). For example, 
the sentence ???????????????
???? should be tagged as follows. 
 
?/L ?/M ?/M ?/R ?/L ?/M ?/M ?/R ?
/L ?/M ?/R ?/L ?/M ?/M ?/M ?/M ?/R 
 
We can easily split the sentence into clauses by 
making a break after each character tagged R 
and S and obtain the final outcome ????? / 
???? / ??? / ???????. 
In this work, more tagging schemes are expe-
rimented. The basic tagging scheme for segmen-
tation is 2-tag set in which only two types of tags, 
?start? and ?non-start?, are used to label the se-
quence. The segmented fragments (clauses) for 
sentence segmentation are usually much longer 
than those for word segmentation. Thus, we add 
more middle states into the 4-tag set to model 
the nature of long fragments. The Markov chain 
of our tagging scheme is shown in Figure 2, 
where L2, L3, ?, Lk are the additional states to 
extend Xue?s 4-tag set. In our experiments, vari-
ous k values are tested. If the k value is 1, the 
scheme is identical to the one used in the two 
previous works (Zhang et al, 2009; Huang, 
2008). The 2-tag set, 4-tag set, 5-tag set and their 
corresponding examples are listed in Table 1. 
With the tagging scheme, the Classical Chinese 
sentence segmentation task is transformed into a 
sequence labeling or tagging task. 
 
4.2 Features 
Due to the flexibility of the feature function in-
terface provided by CRFs, we apply various fea-
ture conjunctions. Besides the n-gram character 
patterns, the phonetic information and the part-

of-speech (POS) are also included. The pronun-
ciation of each Chinese character is labeled in 
three ways. The first one is Mandarin Phonetic 
Symbols (MPS), also known as Bopomofo, 
which is a phonetic system for Modern Chinese. 
The initial/final/tone of each character can be 
obtained from its MPS label.  
However, Chinese pronunciation varies in the 
thousands of years, and the pronunciation of 
Modern Chinese is much different from the 
Classical Chinese. For this reason, two Ancient 
Chinese phonetic systems, Fanqie (??) and 
Guangyun (??), are applied to label the cha-
racters. The pronunciation of a target character is 
represented by two characters in the Fanqie sys-
tem. The first character indicates the initial of 
the target character, and the second character 
indicates the combination of the final and the 
tone. The Guangyun system is in a similar man-
ner with a smaller phonetic symbol set. There 
are 8,157 characters in our phonetic dictionary 
and the statistics are shown in Table 2. 
The POS information is also considered. It is

tagger at this moment. Instead, we collected 
three types of particles that are usually placed at 
the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of 
Classical Chinese clauses. In addition, the inter-
jections which are usually used at the end of 
clauses are also collected. Some examples are 
given in Table 3. The five feature sets and the 
feature templates are shown in Table 4. 
5 Experiments 
There are three major sets of experiments.  In the 
1st set of experiments, we test different tagging 
schemes for Classical Chinese sentence segmen-
tation. In the 2nd set of experiments, all kinds of 
feature sets and their combinations are tested. 
The performances of the first two sets of expe-
riments are evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation 
on four datasets which cross both eras and con-
texts. In the 3rd set of experiments, we train the 
system on one dataset, and test it on the others. 
In last part of the experiments, the generality of 
the datasets and the toughness of our system are 
tested (Peng et al, 2004). The cut-off threshold 
for the features is set to 2 for all the experiments. 
In other words, the features occur only once in 
the training set will be ignored. The other op-
tions of CrfSgd remain default. 
5.1 Datasets 
The datasets used in the evaluation are collected 
from the corpora of the Pre-Qin and Han Dynas-
ties (the 5th century BCE to the 1st century BCE) 
and the Qing Dynasty (the 17th century CE to 
the 20th century CE). Chinese in the 19th cen-
tury is fairly different from Chinese in the era 
before 0 CE. In ancient Chinese, the syntax is 
much simpler, the sentences are shorter, and the 
words are largely composed of a single character. 
Those are unlike later and more modern Chinese, 
where word segmentation is a serious issue. 
Given these properties, the task of segmenting

ancient Chinese sentences is easier than that of 
segmenting later Chinese ones. Thus, we col-
lected texts from the pre-Qin and Han period, 
and from the late Qing Dynasty closer to the 
present, to show that our system can handle 
Classical Chinese as it has evolved across a span 
of two thousand years. 
A summary of the four datasets is listed in 
Table 5. The Zuozhuan is one of earliest histori-
cal works, recording events of China in the 
Spring and Autumn Period (from 722 BCE to 
481 BCE). The book Zhuangzi was named after 
its semi-legendary author, the Daoist philoso-
pher Zhuangzi, who lived around the 4th century 
BCE. The book consists of stories and fables, in 
which the philosophy of the Dao is propounded. 
The Shiji, known in English as The Records of 
the Grand Historian, was written by Qian Sima 
in the 1st century BCE. It narrates Chinese histo-
ry from 2600 BCE to 100 BCE. The Shiji is not 
only an extremely long book of more than 
500,000 characters, but also the chief historical 
work of ancient China, exerting an enormous 
influence on subsequent Chinese literature and 
historiography. 
The three ancient works are the most impor-
tant classics of Chinese literature. We fetched 
well-segmented electronic editions of these 
works from the online database of the Institute 
of History and philology of the Academia Sinica, 
Taiwan.2 Each work was partitioned into para-
graphs forming a single data entry, which acted 
as the basic unit of training and testing. The da-
taset of Qing documents is selected from the 
Qing Palace Memorials (??) related to Taiwan 
written in the 19th century. These documents 
were kindly provided by the Taiwan History 
Digital Library and have also been human-
segmented and stored on electronic media (Chen 
et al, 2007). We randomly selected 1,000 para-
graphs from them as our dataset.

For Classical Chinese sentence segmentation, we 
define the precision P as the ratio of the bounda-
ries of clauses which are correctly segmented to 
all segmented boundaries, the recall R as the ra-
tio of correctly segmented boundaries to all ref-
erence boundaries, and the score F as the har-
monic mean of precision and recall:

6 Results 
Our baseline is a majority-class tagger which 
always regards the whole paragraph as a single 
sentence (i.e., never segments). In Table 6, the 
performance of the baseline is given. In the 1st 
set of experiments, four tagging schemes are 
tested while the feature set is Character. The re-
sults are shown in Table 7. In the table, each of 
the precision, the recall, and the F-score are av-
eraged over the four datasets for each scheme. 
The results show that the CRF with the 5-tag set 
is superior to the 4-tag set used in previous 
works. However, the performance is degraded 
when the k is larger.  
In the 2nd set of experiments, the tag scheme 
is fixed to the 5-tag set and a number of feature 
set combinations are tested. The results are 
shown in Table 8. The performance of MPS is 
significantly inferior to the other two phonetic 
systems. As expected, the pronunciation of Clas-
sical Chinese is much different from that of 
Modern Chinese, thus the Ancient Chinese pho-
netic systems are more suitable for this work. 
The Fanqie has a surprisingly performance close 
to the Character. However, performance of the 
combination of Character and Fanqie is similar 
to the performance of Character only model. 
This result indicates that the phonetic informa-
tion is an important clue to Classical Chinese 
sentence segmentation but such information is 
mostly already covered by the characters. Be-
sides, the simple POS features do not help a lot. 
The higher precision and the lower recall of the 
POS features show that the particles such as ?/
?/?/? is indeed a clue to segmentation, but 
does not catch enough cases. 
The best performance comes from the com-
bination of Character and Fanqie with the 5-tag 
set. We use this configuration as our final tagger. 
The performances of our tagger for each dataset 
are given in Table 9. The result shows that our 
tagger achieves fairly good performance on the 
Zuozhuan segmentation, while obtaining accept-
able performance overall. Because the 19th cen-
tury Chinese is more complex than ancient Chi-
nese, what we had assumed was that segmenta-
tion of the Qing documents would more difficult. 
However, the results indicate that our assump-
tion does not seem to be true. Our tagger per-
forms the sentence segmentation on the Qing 
documents well, even better than on the Zhuang-
zi and on the Shiji. The issues of longer clauses 
and word segmentation described earlier in this 
paper do not significantly affect the performance 
of our system. 
In the last experiments, our system is trained 
and tested on different datasets, and the results 
are presented in Table 10, where the training 
datasets are in the rows and the test datasets are 
in the columns, and the F-scores of the segmen-
tation performance are shown in the inner entries. 
As expected, the results of segmentation tasks 
across datasets are significantly poorer than the 
segmentation in the first two experiments. 
These results indicate that our system main-
tains its performance on a test dataset differing 
from the training dataset, but the difference in 
written eras between the test dataset and training 
dataset cannot be very large. Among all datasets, 
Shiji is the best training dataset. As training on 
Shiji and testing on the two other ancient corpo-
ra Zuozhuan and Zhuangzi, the performances of 
our CRF segmenter are not bad.

7 Conclusion 
Our Classical Chinese sentence segmentation is 
important for many applications such as text 
mining, information retrieval, corpora research, 
and digital archiving. To aid in processing such 
kind of data, an automatic sentence segmenta-
tion system is proposed. Different tagging 
schemes and various features are introduced and 
tested. Our system was evaluated using three 
sets of experiments. Five main results are de-
rived. First, the CRF segmenter achieves an F-
score of 91.79% in the best case and 83.34% in 
overall performance. Second, a little longer tag-
ging scheme improves the performance. Third, 
the phonetic information, especially sourced 
from Fanqie, is an important clue for Classical 
Chinese sentence segmentation and may be use-
ful in the related tasks. Fourth, our method per-
forms well on data from various eras. In the ex-
periments, texts from both 500 BCE and the 
19th century were well-segmented. Last, the 
CRF segmenter maintains a certain level of per-
formance in situations which the test data and 
the training data differ in authors, genres, and 
written styles, but eras in which they were pro-
duced are sufficiently close.
