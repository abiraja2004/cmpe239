Abstract
This paper presents a generalized frame-
work of syntax-based gap resolution in ana-
lytic language translation using an extended
version of categorial grammar. Translat-
ing analytic languages into Indo-European
languages suffers the issues of gapping,
because ?deletion under coordination? and
?verb serialization? are necessary to be re-
solved beforehand. Rudimentary operations,
i.e. antecedent memorization, gap induction,
and gap resolution, were introduced to the
categorial grammar to resolve gapping is-
sues syntactically. Hereby, pronominal ref-
erences can be generated for deletion under
coordination, while sentence structures can
be properly selected for verb serialization.
1 Background
Analytic language, such as Chinese, Thai, and Viet-
namese, is any language whose syntax and meaning
relies on particles and word orders rather than inflec-
tion. Pronouns and other grammatical information,
such as tense, aspect, and number, expressed by use
of adverbs and adjectives, are often omitted. In addi-
tion to deletion under coordination and verb serial-
ization, called gapping (Hendriks, 1995), translation
from analytic languages into Indo-European ones
becomes a hard task because (1) an ordinary parser
cannot parse some problematic gapping patterns and
(2) these omissions are necessary to be resolved be-
forehand. We classify resolution of the issue into
two levels: syntactic/semantic and pragmatic. Gap-
ping, which we considered as a set of bound vari-
ables, can be resolved in syntactic/semantic level
(Partee, 1975). Omission of other grammatical in-
formation is, on the contrary, to be resolved in prag-
matic level because some extra-linguistic knowledge
is required. Consequently, we concentrate in this pa-
per the resolution of gapping by means of syntax and
semantics.
Many proposals to gap resolution were intro-
duced, but we classify them into two groups: non-
ellipsis-based and ellipsis-based. Non-ellipsis-based
approach is characterized by: (a) strong proof sys-
tem (Lambek, 1958), and (b) functional composition
and type raising that allow coordination of incom-
plete constituents, such as CG (Ajdukiewicz, 1935;
Bar-Hillel, 1953; Moortgat, 2002), CCG (Steed-
man, 2000), and multimodal CCG (Baldridge and
Kruijff, 2003). Proposals in this approach, such
as (Hendriks, 1995; Ja?ger, 1998a; Ja?ger, 1998b),
introduced specialized operators to resolve overt
anaphora, while covert anaphora is left unsolved.
Ellipsis-based approach is characterized by treat-
ing incomplete constituents as if they are of the
same simple type but contain ellipsis inside (Yatabe,
2002; Cryssmann, 2003; Beavers and Sag, 2004).
However, Beavers and Sag (2004) evidenced that
ellipsis-based analysis possibly reduces the accept-
ability of language, because the resolution is per se
completely uncontrolled.
In this paper, we introduce an integration of the
two approaches that incorporates strong proof sys-
tem and ellipsis-based analysis. Antecedent memo-
rization and gap induction are introduced to imitate
ellipsis-based analysis. The directions of ellipsis are
80
also used to improve the acceptability of language.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the formalization of our method.
Section 3 evidences the coverage of the framework
on coping with the gapping issues in analytic lan-
guages. Section 4 further discusses coverage and
limitations of the framework comparing with CG
and its descendants. Section 5 explains relevance
of the proposed formalism to MT. Finally, Section 6
concludes the paper and lists up future work.
2 Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar
Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar, abbrevi-
ated MICG, is a version of pure categorial grammar
extended by ellipsis-based analysis. On the con-
trary, it relies on antecedent memorization, gap in-
duction, and gap resolution that outperform CCG?s
functional composition and type raising.
All grammatical expressions of MICG are, like
CG, distinguished by a syntactic category identify-
ing them as either a function from arguments of one
type to result another (a.k.a. function), or an argu-
ment (a.k.a. primitive category). Let us exemplify
the MICG by defining an example grammar G be-
low.
John,Mary,sandwich,noodle ? np
eats ? (np\s)/np
and ? &
The lexicons John, Mary, sandwich, and noodle are as-
signed with a primitive category np. The lexicon
eats is assigned with a function that forms a sentence
s after taking np from the right side (/np) and then
taking np from the left side (np\). The lexicon and is
assigned with a conjunction category (&). By means
of syntactic categories assigned to each lexicon, the
derivation for a simple sentence ?John eats noodle? is
shown in (1).
John eats noodle
John ? np eats ? (np\s)/np noodle ? np
eats?noodle ? np\s
John ? (eats?noodle) ? s
(1)
CG suffers some patterns of coordination e.g.
SVO&SO as exemplified in (2).
John eats noodle, and Mary, sandwich.(2)
One should find that the second conjunct cannot be
reduced into s by means of CG, because it lacks of
the main verb ?eats.? The main verb in the first con-
junct should be remembered and then filled up to
the ellipsis of the second conjunct to accomplish the
derivation. This matter of fact motivated us to de-
velop MICG by introducing to CG the process of
remembering an antecedent from a conjunct, called
memorization, and filling up an ellipsis in the other
conjunct, called induction. There are three manda-
tory operations in MICG: antecedent memorization,
gap induction, and gap resolution.
One of two immediate formulae combined in
the derivation can be memorized as an antecedent.
The resulted syntactic category is modalized by the
modality 2DF , where D is a direction of memoriza-
tion (< for the left side and > for the right side),
and F is the memorized formula. The syntactic
structure of the memorized formula is also modal-
ized with the notation 2 to denote the memoriza-
tion. It is restricted in MICG that the memorized for-
mula must be unmodalized to maintain mild context-
sensitivity. For example, let us consider the deriva-
tion of the first conjunct of (2), ?John eats noodle,?
with antecedent memorization at the verb ?eats? in
(3). As seen, a modalized formula can combine with
another unmodalized formula while all modalities
are preserved.
John eats noodle
John ? np 2eats ? (np\s)/np noodle ? np
2eats?noodle ? 2<eats?(np\s)/np(np\s)
John ? (2eats?noodle) ? 2<eats?(np\s)/nps
(3)
Any given formula can be induced for a missing
formula, or a gap, at any direction, and the induced
gap contains a syntactic category that can be com-
bined to that of the formula. The resulted syntactic
category of combining the formula and the gap is
modalized by the modality 3DF , where D is a direc-
tion of induction, and F is the induced formula at the
gap. The syntactic structure of F is an uninstantiated
variable and also modalized with the notation 3 to
denote the induction. The induced formula is neces-
sary to be unmodalized for mild context-sensitivity.
For example, let us consider the derivation of the
second conjunct of (2), ?Mary, sandwich,? with gap in-
duction before the word ?sandwich? in (4). The vari-
81
able of syntactic structure will be resolved with an
appropriate antecedent containing the same syntac-
tic category in the gap resolution process.
Mary sandwich
Mary ? np sandwich ? np
3X ? sandwich ? 3<X?(np\s)/np(np\s)
Mary ? (3X ? sandwich) ? 3<X?(np\s)/nps
(4)
Gap resolution matches between memorized an-
tecedents and induced gaps to associate ellipses to
their antecedents during derivation of coordination
and serialization. That is, two syntactic categories
2D1F1 C and 3
D2
F2 C are matched up and canceled from
the resulted syntactic category, if they have the same
syntactic categories C, their directions D1 and D2
are equal, and their memorized/induced formulae F1
and F2 are unified. For example, let us consider the
derivation of ?John eats noodle, and Mary, sandwich?
in Figure 1. The modalities 2<eats?(np\s)/nps and
3<X?(np\s)/nps are matched up together. Their mem-
orized/induced formulae are also unified by instan-
tiating the variable X with ?eats?. Eventually, af-
ter combining them and the conjunction ?and,? the
derivation yields out the formula (John ? (2eats ?
noodle))? (and? (Mary? (3eats? sandwich))) ? s.
Gap resolution could also indicate argument shar-
ing in coordination and serialization. 3D1F1 C and
3D2F2 C can be also matched up, if they have the same
syntactic categories C, their directions D1 and D2
are equal, and their memorized/induced formulae F1
and F2 are unified. However, they must be preserved
in the resulted syntactic category. For example, let
us consider the derivation in Figure 2. By means of
unification of induced formulae, the variables X and
Y are unified into the variable Z.
A formal definition of MICG is given in Ap-
pendix A. MICG is applied to resolve deletion under
coordination and serialization in analytic languages
in the next section.
3 Gap Resolution in Analytic Languages
There are two causes of gapping in analytic lan-
guages: coordination and serial verb construction.
Each of which complicates the analysis module of
MT to resolve such issue before transferring. In this
section, problematic gapping patterns are analyzed
in forms of generalized patterns by MICG. For sim-
plification reason, syntactic structure is suppressed
during derivation.
3.1 To resolve gapping under coordination
Coordination in analytic languages is more com-
plex than that of Indo-European ones. Multi-
conjunct coordination is suppressed here because
biconjunct coordination can be applied. Besides
SVO&VO and SV&SVO patterns already resolved
by CCG (Steedman, 2000), there are also SVO&SV,
SVO&V, SVO&SO (already illustrated in Figure 1),
and SVO&SA patterns.
The pattern SVO&SV exhibits ellipsis at the ob-
ject position of the second conjunct. The analysis of
SVO&SV is illustrated in (5). It shows that the ob-
ject of the first conjunct is memorized while the verb
of the second conjunct is induced for the object.
S V O & S V
np (np\s)/np np & np (np\s)/np
2>np(np\s) 3>np(np\s)
2>nps 3>nps
s
(5)
Analysis of the sentence pattern SVO&V, illus-
trated in (6), exhibits ellipses at the subject and the
object positions of the second conjunct. The subject
and the object of the first conjunct are memorized,
while the verb of the second conjunct is induced
twice for the object and for the subject, respectively.
S V O & V
np (np\s)/np np & (np\s)/np
2>np(np\s) 3>np(np\s)
2<np2>nps 3<np3>nps
s
(6)
The pattern SVO&SA exhibits ellipsis at the pred-
icate position of the second conjunct, because only
the adverb (A) is left. Suppose the adverb, typed
(np\s)/(np\s), precedes the predicate. Illustrated in
(7), the predicate of the first conjunct is memorized,
while the adverb of the second conjunct is inducted
for the predicate.

3.2 To resolve gapping under serial verb
construction
Serial verb construction (SVC) (Baker, 1989) is con-
struction in which a sequence of verbs appears in
what seems to be a single clause. Usually, the
verbs have a single structural object and share log-
ical arguments (Baker, 1989). Following (Li and
Thompson, 1981; Wang, 2007; Thepkanjana, 2006),
we classify SVC into three main types: consecu-
tive/concurrent events, purpose, and circumstance.
No operation specialized for tracing antecedent
projection in consecutive/concurrent event construc-
tion has been proposed in CG or its descendants. In
MICG, the serialization operation is specialized for
this construction. For example, a Chinese sentence
from (Wang, 2007) in (8) is analyzed as in (9).
ta? ma?i pia`o j??n qu`
he buy ticket enter go
?He buys a ticket and then goes inside.?
(8)
ta? ma?i pia`o j??n qu`
np (np\s)/np np np\s np\s
np\s 3<nps 3<nps
2<nps 3<nps
s
(9)
Illustrated in (9), the subject argument ta? ?he? is pro-
jected through the verb sequence by means of mem-
orization and induction modalities.
Purpose construction can also be handled by
MICG. For example, a Thai sentence in (10) is ana-
lyzed as in (11).
kha?V tO`: thO?: paj Cha?j naj ba?:n
he attach pipe go use in house
?He attaches pipes to use in the house.?
(10)
kha?V tO`: thO?: paj Cha?j naj ba?:n
np (np\s)/np np s\s (np\s)/np (s\s)/np np
2>np(np\s) 3>np(np\s) s\s
2<np2>nps 3<np3>nps
2<np2>nps 3<np3>nps
s
(11)
Illustrated in (11), the two logical arguments, i.e. the
subject kha?V ?he? and the object thO?: ?pipe,? are pro-
jected through the construction.
SVC expressing circumstance of action is syntac-
tically considered much as consecutive event con-
struction. For example, a Chinese sentence from
(Wang, 2007) in (12) is analyzed as in (13).
wo? yo`ng kua`izi ch?? fa`n
I use chopstick eat meal
?I eat meal with chopsticks.?
(12)
wo? yo`ng kua`izi ch?? fa`n
np (np\s)/np np (np\s)/np np
np\s np\s
2<nps 3<nps
s
(13)
4 Coverage and Limitations
Proven in Theorem 1 in Appendix A, memorized
constituents and induced constituents are cross-
serially associated. Controlled by order and di-
rection, each memorized constituent is guaranteed
to be cross-serially associated to its corresponding
induced gap, while each gap pair is also cross-
serially associated revealing argument sharing. This
causes cross-serial association, illustrated in Fig-
ure 3, among memorized constituents and induced
gaps. Since paired modalities are either eliminated
or preserved and no modalities are left on the start
83
symbol, it guarantees that there is eventually no
modality in derivation. In conclusion, no excessive
gap is over-generated in the language.

Figure 3: Cross-serial association
MICG?s antecedent memorization and gap induc-
tion perform well in handling node raising. Node
raising is analyzed in terms of MICG by memorizing
the raised constituent at the conjunct it occurs and
inducing a gap at the other conjunct. For example,
the right node ?ice cream? is raised in the sentence ?I
like but you don?t like ice cream.? The sentence can
be analyzed in terms of MICG in (14).
I like but you don?t like ice cream
np (np\s)/np & np (np\s)/np np
3>np(np\s) 2>np(np\s)
3>nps 2>nps
s
(14)
Topicalization and contraposition are still the is-
sues to be concerned for coverage over CCG. For
example, in an example sentence ?Bagels, Yo said
that Jan likes? from (Beavers and Sag, 2004), the
NP ?Bagels? is topicalized from the object position
of the relative clause?s complement. (15) shows un-
parsability of the sentence.
Bagels, Yo said that Jan likes
np np (np\s)/cl cl/s np (np\s)/np
3>np(np\s)
3>nps
3>nps
3>np(np\s)
3>nps
?????
(15)
Furthermore, constituent shifting, such as dative
shift and adjunct shift, is not supported by MICG.
We found that it is also constituent extraction as
consecutive constituents other than the shifted one
are extracted from the sentence. For example, the
adjunct ?skillfully? is shifted next to the main verb
in the sentence ?Kahn blocked skillfully a powerful
shot by Ronaldo? from (Baldridge, 2002) in (16).
a powerful shot
Kahn blocked skillfully by Ronaldo
np (np\s)/np (np\s)\(np\s) np
3>np(np\s)
3>np(np\s)
3>nps
?????
(16)
Since MICG was inspired by reasons other than
those of CCG, the coverage of MICG is therefore
different from CCG. Let us compare CG, CCG, and
MICG in Table 1. CCG initially attempted to han-
dle linguistic phenomena in English and other Indo-
European languages, in which topicalization and da-
tive shift play an important role. Applied to many
other languages such as German, Dutch, Japanese,
and Turkish, CCG is still unsuitable for analytic lan-
guages. MICG instead was inspired by deletion un-
der coordination and serial verb construction in ana-
lytic languages. We are in progress to develop an ex-
tension of MICG that allows topicalization and da-
tive shift avoiding combinatoric explosion.
5 Relevance to RBMT
Major issues of MT from analytic languages into
Indo-European ones include three issues: anaphora
generation, semantic duplication, and sentence
structuring. Both syntax and semantics are used to
solve such problems by MICG?s capability of gap
resolution. Case studies from our RBMT are exem-
plified for better understanding.
Our Thai-English MT system is rule-based and
consists of three modules: analysis, transfer, and
generation. MICG is used to tackle sentences with
deletion under coordination and SVC which cannot
be parsed by ordinary parsers. For good speed effi-
ciency, an MICG parser was implemented in GLR-
based approach and used to analyze the syntactic
structure of a given sentence before transferring.
The parser detects zero anaphora and resolves their
antecedents in coordinate structure, and reveals ar-
gument sharing in SVC. Therefore, coordinate struc-
ture and SVC can be properly translated.
No experiment has been done on our system yet,
but we hope to see an improvement of translation
quality. We planned to evaluate the translation accu-
racy by using both statistical and human methods.

5.1 Translation of deletion under coordination
Coordinate structures in Thai drastically differ from
those of English. This is because Thai allows zero
anaphora at subject and object positions while En-
glish does not. Pronouns and VP ellipses must there-
fore be generated in place of deletion under coordi-
nation for grammaticality of English. Moreover, se-
mantic duplication is often made use to emphasize
the meaning of sentence, but its direct translation be-
comes redundant.
MICG helps us detect zero anaphora and resolve
their antecedents, so that appropriate pronouns and
ellipses can be generated at the right positions. By
tracing resolved antecedents and ellipses, argument
projections are disclosed and they can be used to
control verb fusion. We exemplify three cases of
translation of coordinate structure.
Case 1: Pronouns are generated to maintain
grammaticality of English translation if the two
verbs are not postulated in the verb-fusion table. For
example, a Thai sentence in (17) is translated, while
pronouns ?he? and ?it? are generated from Thai NPs
na?k;rian ?student? and kha`;no?m ?candy,? respectively.
na?k;rianS sW?:V kha`;no?mO lE?:V& kinV
student buy candy then eat
?A student buys candy, then he eats it.?
(17)
Case 2: Two verbs V1 and V2 are fused togeth-
erif they are postulated in the verb-fusion table to
eliminate semantic duplication in English transla-
tion. The object form of S2 is necessary to be gener-
ated in some cases. For example, in (18), the trans-
lation becomes ?He reports her this matter? instead
of ?He tells her to know this matter.? Two verbs bO`:k
?tell? and sa?:b ?know? are fused into a single verb ?re-
port.? The object form of ?she,? ?her,? is also gener-
ated.
kha?VS bO`:kV ha?j& th@:S sa?:pV rW?:@N n??:O
he tell TO she know this matter
?He reports her this matter.?
(18)
Case 3: A VP ellipsis is generated to main-
tain English grammaticality. For example, in (19),
a VP ellipsis ?do? is generated from a Thai VP
ma?i ChO?:b don;tri: rO?k ?not like rock music.?
CO:nS ChO?:pV don;tri: rO?kO tE`:& Cha?nS ma?iA
John like rock music but I not
?John likes rock music, but I do not.?
(19)
5.2 Translation of SVC
Sentence structuring is also nontrivial for translation
of Thai SVC. Thai uses SVC to describe consecu-
tive/concurrent events, purposes, and circumstances.
On the other hand, English describes each of those
with different sentence structure. A series of verbs
with duplicated semantics can be also clustered to
emphasize the meaning of sentence in Thai, while
English does not allow this phenomenon.
Because MICG reveals argument sharing in SVC,
appropriate sentence structures can be selected by
tracing argument sharing between two consecutive
verbs. We exemplify two cases of translation of
SVC.
Case 1: The second verb is participialized if the
first verb is intransitive and its semantic concept is
an action. For example, the present participial form
of the verb ?see,? ?seeing,? is generated in (20) .
so?m;Cha:jS d@:nV ChomV pha?:p;khia?nO
Somchai walk see paintings
?Somchai walks seeing paintings.?
(20)
Case 2: If the two cases above do not apply to
the two verbs, they are translated directly by de-
fault. The conjunction ?and? is automatically added
85
to conjoin two verb phrases. In case of multiple-
conjunct coordination, the conjunction will be added
only before the last conjunct. For example, in (21),
a pronoun ?it? is generated from the NP kho?:k ?coke,?
while the conjunction ?and? is automatically added.
ph?i:;sa?:VS sW?:V kho?:kO dW`:mV
my elder sister buy coke drink
?My elder sister buys coke and drinks it.?

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presents Memory-Inductive Categorial
Grammar (MICG), an extended version of catego-
rial grammar, for gap resolution in analytic language
translation. Antecedent memorization, gap induc-
tion, and gap resolution, are proposed to cope with
deletion under coordination and serial verb construc-
tion. By means of MICG, anaphora can be gen-
erated for deletion under coordination, while sen-
tence structure can be properly selected for serial
verb construction. No experiment has been done to
show improvement of translation quality by MICG.
The following future work remains. First, we will
experiment on our Thai-English RBMT to measure
improvement of translation quality. Second, crite-
ria for pronominal reference generation in place of
deletion under coordination will be studied. Third,
once serial verb construction is analyzed, criteria of
sentence structuring will further be studied based on
an analysis of antecedent projection. Fourth and fi-
nally, constituent extraction and the use of extraction
direction in the extraction resolution will be studied
to avoid combinatoric explosion.

Definition 3 (MICG) A memory-inductive categorial gram-
mar (MICG) is defined as a quadruple G = ?VT ,VA,s,R?,
where: (1) VT and VA are as above. (2) s ?VA is the designated
symbol called ?start symbol.? (3) R :VT 7?P(F) is a function as-
signing to each terminal symbol a set of formulae from F. The
set of all strings generated from G is denoted as L(G).

The binary relation ?? F??F? holds between two strings
of formulae ?X? and ?Y ?, denoted ?X? ? ?Y ?, if and only if
X |=Y , where X ,Y,?,? ? F? and |X | ? |Y |. The relation ?? is
the reflexive transitive closure of ?.
A string w ? V ?T is generated by G, denoted by w ? L(G), if
and only if w = w1 . . .wn and there is some sequence of formulae
f1 . . . fn such that fi ?R(wi) for all 1 ? i ? n, and f1 . . . fn ?? s.
That is, w1 . . .wn is generated if and only if there is some choice
of formula assignments by R to the symbols in w1 . . .wn that
reduces to s.
Definition 5 Correspondence between a grammatical struc-
ture and its syntactic category can be viewed as a tree with spe-
cialized node types. Each node is represented (m,S), where m
is a node type { /0,2,3}, and S is a modality sequence attached
to the node?s syntactic category.
Definition 6 A node that has the type m is said to be marked m
where m ? {2, 3}, while a node that has the type /0 is said to
be unmarked.
Definition 7 The function ? : Q 7? {2,3} maps a modality to
a node modality, where ?(2df ) = 2 and ?(3df ) = 3 for all d ?D
and f ? F.
Definition 8 A substring generated from a node marked ?(M)
beneath the node n is said to be unpaired under n, if and only if
n has the modality sequence S and M ? S.
Definition 9 Every string w generated from MICG can be
rewritten in the form w = p1q1 . . . plql pl+1ql+1 . . . p2lq2l p2l+1,
where qi is a substring unpaired under n, p j is a substring gen-
erated from unmarked nodes beneath n, 1 ? i ? l, 1 ? j ? l +1,
and l ? 0.
Theorem 1 (Cross-serial association) For every string gener-
ated from MICG w = p1q1 . . . plql p j(l)q j(1) . . . p j(l)q j(l) p j(l)+1,
every couple qi and q j(i) are associated by ? for all 1 ? i ? l,
where j(i) = l + i and l ? 0.
Proof Let us prove this property by mathematical induction.
Basic step: Let l = 0. We obtain that w0 = p1. Since there is
no unpaired substring, this case is trivially proven.
Hypothesis: Let l = k. Suppose that wk =
p1q1 . . . p j(k)q j(k) p j(k)+1. We rewrite wk = w1kw2k , where w1k =
p1q1 . . . pkqk p?j(1) and w
2
k = p??j(1)q j(1) . . . p j(k)q j(k) p j(k)+1.
Every couple qi and q j(k) are associated by ? for all 1 ? i ? k.
Induction: Let l = k + 1; wk+1 = p1q1 . . . p j(k)+2q j(k)+2
p j(k)+3, consequently. Let the formulae of the substrings
wk+1 = w1k+1w2k+1 be t1k+1 ? m1M1 and t2k+1 ? m2M2, respec-
tively. We can rewrite the substrings wk+1 = w1k+1w2k+1 in terms
of wk = w1kw2k in three cases.
Case I: Suppose w1k+1 = pqw1k . It follows that the direction
of q is <. Since w1k+1 combines w2k+1, we can conclude that
w2k+1 = p?q?w2k . Therefore, q and q? are also associated by ?.
Case II: Suppose w1k+1 = w1kqp. It follows that the direction
of q is >. Since w1k+1 combines w2k+1, we can conclude that
w2k+1 = w2kq?p?. Therefore, q and q? are also associated by ?.
Case III: w1k+1 = p1q1 . . . pmqm pqpm+1qm+1 . . . pnqn pk+1 and
w2k+1 = p j(1)q j(1) . . . p j(m?)q j(m?) p?q?p j(m?)+1q j(m?)+1 . . . p j(k)
q j(k) p j(k)+1, where 1 < m,m? < k. Since w1k+1 and w2k+1
combine and every qi and q j(i) are associated, we can conclude
that m = m?. Therefore, q and q? are also associated by ?.
From Case I, Case II, and Case III, we can rewrite w1k+1 =
p?1q
?
1 p
?
2q
?
2 . . . p?k+1 and w2k+1 = p?j(1)q?j(1) p?j(2)q?j(2) . . . p?j(k+1).
Since each qi in w1k and q j(i) in w
2
k are already associated by
?, it follows that all qi and q j(i)+1 are also associated. 
