ABSTRACT 
This paper describes recent progress and the 
author's perspectives of speech recognition 
technology. Applications of speech recognition 
technology can be classified into two main areas, 
dictation and human-computer dialogue systems. 
In the dictation domain, the automatic broadcast 
news transcription is now actively investigated, 
especially under the DARPA project. The 
broadcast news dictation technology has recently 
been integrated with information extraction and 
retrieval technology and many application 
systems, such as automatic voice document 
indexing and retrieval systems, are under 
development. In the human-computer interaction 
domain, a variety of experimental systems for 
information retrieval through spoken dialogue are 
being investigated. In spite of the remarkable 
recent progress, we are still behind our ultimate 
goal of understanding free conversational speech 
uttered by any speaker under any environment. 
This paper also describes the most important 
research issues that we should attack in order to 
advance to our ultimate goal of fluent speech 
recognition. 
pattern recognition paradigm, a data-driven 
approach which makes use of a rich set of speech 
utterances from a large population of speakers, 
the use of stochastic acoustic and language 
modeling, and the use of dynamic programming- 
based search methods. 
A series of (D)ARPA projects have been a major 
driving force of the recent progress in research 
on large-vocabulary, continuous-speech 
recognition. Specifically, dictation of speech 
reading newspapers, uch as north America 
business newspapers including the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ), and conversational speech 
recognition using an Air Travel Information 
System (ATIS) task were actively investigated. 
More recent DARPA programs are the broadcast 
news dictation and natural conversational speech 
recognition using Switchboard and Call Home 
tasks. Research on human-computer dialogue 
systems, the Communicator p ogram, has also 
started \[ 1 \]. Various other systems have been 
actively investigated in US, Europe and Japan 
stimulated by DARPA projects. Most of them 
can be classified into either dictation systems or 
human-computer dialogue systems. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The field of automatic speech recognition has 
witnessed a number of significant advances in 
the past 5 - 10 years, spurred on by advances in 
signal processing, algorithms, computational 
architectures, and hardware. These advances 
include the widespread adoption of a statistical 
Figure 1 shows a mechanism of state-of-the-art 
speech recognizers \[2\]. Common features of 
these systems are the use of cepstral parameters 
and their regression coefficients as speech 
features, triphone HMMs as acoustic models, 
vocabularies of several thousand or several ten 
thousand entries, and stochastic language models 
such as bigrams and trigrams. Such methods have 
11 
been applied not only to English but also to 
French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese and 
Japanese. Although there are several language- 
specific characteristics, similar recognition 
results have been obtained.

world domain of obvious value has lead to rapid 
technology transfer of speech recognition i to 
other esearch areas and applications. Since the 
variations in speaking style and accent as well 
as in channel and environment conditions are 
totally unconstrained, broadcast news 
is a superb stress test hat requires new 
algorithms to work across widely 
varying conditions. Algorithms need 
to solve a specific problem without 
degrading any other condit ion.  
Another advantage of this domain is 
that news is easy to collect and the 
supply of data is boundless. The data 
is found speech; it is completely 
uncontrived.

The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 describes recent progress in 
broadcast news dictation and its application to 
information extraction, and Section 3 describes 
human-computer dialogue systems. In spite of 
the remarkable r cent progress, we are still far 
behind our ultimate goal of understanding free 
conversational speech uttered by any speaker 
under any environment. Section 4describes how 
to increase the robustness of speech recognition, 
and Section 5 describes perspectives of linguistic 
modeling for spontaneous speech recognition/ 
understanding. Section 6 concludes the paper. 
2. BROADCAST NEWS DICTATION AND 
INFORMATION EXTRACTION 
2.1 DARPA Broadcast News Dictation Project 
With the introduction ofthe broadcast news test 
bed to the DARPA project in 1995, the research 
effort took a profound step forward. Many of 
the deficiencies ofthe WSJ domain were resolved 
in the broadcast news domain \[3\]. Most 
importantly, the fact that broadcast news is a real- 
2.2 Japanese Broadcast News 
Dictation System 
We have been developing a large- 
vocabulary continuous-speech recognition 
(LVCSR) system for Japanese broadcast-news 
speech transcription \[4\]\[5\]. This is a part of a 
joint research with the NHK broadcast company 
whose goal is the closed-captioning of TV 
programs. The broadcast-news manuscripts hat 
were used for constructing the language models 
were taken from the period between July 1992 
? and May 1996, and comprised roughly 500k 
sentences and 22M words. To calculate word n- 
gram language models, we segmented the 
broadcast-news manuscripts into words by using 
a morphological analyzer since Japanese 
sentences are written without spaces between 
words. A word-frequency list was derived for the 
news manuscripts, and the 20k most frequently 
used words were selected as vocabulary words. 
This 20k vocabulary covers about 98% of the 
words in the broadcast-news manuscripts. We 
calculated bigrams and trigrams and estimated 
unseen -grams using Katz's back-off smoothing 
method. 
Japanese text is written by a mixture of three 
kinds of characters: Chinese characters (Kanji) 
12 
and two kinds of Japanese characters (Hira-gana 
and Kata-kana). Most Kanji have multiple 
readings, and correct readings can only be 
decided according to context. Conventional 
language models usually assign equal probability 
to all possible readings of each word. This causes 
recognit ion errors because the assigned 
probability is sometimes very different from the 
true probability. We therefore constructed a 
language model that depends on the readings of 
words in order to take into account the frequency 
and context-dependency of the readings. 
Broadcast news speech includes filled pauses at 
the beginning and in the middle of sentences, 
which cause recognition errors in our language 
models that use news manuscripts written prior 
to broadcasting. To cope with this problem, we 
introduced filled-pause modeling into the 
language model.

News speech data, from TV broadcasts in July 
1996, were divided into two parts, a clean part 
and a noisy part, and were separately evaluated. 
The clean part consisted of utterances with no 
background noise, and the noisy part consisted 
of utterances with background noise. The noisy 
part included spontaneous speech such as reports 
by correspondents. We extracted 50 male 
utterances and 50 female utterances for each part, 
yielding four evaluation sets; male-clean (m/c), 
male-noisy (m/n), female-clean (f/c), female- 
noisy (fin). Each set included utterances by five 
or six speakers. All utterances were manually 
segmented into sentences. Table 1 shows the 
experimental results for the baseline language 
model (LM 1) and the new language models. LM2 
is the reading-dependent language model, and 
LM3 is a modification of LM2 by filled-pause 
modeling. For clean speech, LM2 reduced the 
word error rate by 4.7 % relative to LM1, and 
LM3 model reduced the word error rate by 10.9 
% relative to LM2 on average. 
2.3 Information Extraction in the DARPA 
Project 
News is fi l led with events, people, and 
organizations and all manner of relations among 
them. The great richness of material and the 
naturally evolving content in broadcast news has 
leveraged its value into areas of research well 
beyond speech recognition. In the DARPA 
project, the Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) 
of TREC and the Topic Detection and Tracking 
(TDT) program are supported by the same 
materials and systems that have been 
developed inthe broadcast news dictation 
arena \[3\]. BBN'sRough'n'Reddy system 
extracts tructural features of broadcast 
news. CMU's Informedia \[6\], MITRE's 
Broadcast Navigator, and SRI's Maestro 
have all exploited the multi-media features 
of news producing a wide range of 
capabilities for browsing news archives 
interactively. These systems integrate 
various diverse speech and language 
technologies including speech recognition, 
speaker change detection, speaker identification, 
name extaction, topic classif ication and 
information retrieval. 
2.4 Information Extraction from Japanese 
Broadcast News 
Summarizing transcribed news speech is useful 
for retrieving or indexing broadcast news. We 
investigated a method for extracting topic words 
from nouns in the speech recognition results on 
the basis of a significance measure \[4\]\[5\]. The 
extracted topic words were compared with "true" 
topic words, which were given by three human 
subjects. The results are shown in Figure 2.

When the top five topic words were chosen 
(recall=13%), 87% of them were correct on 
average.

3. HUMAN-COMPUTER DIALOGUE 
SYSTEMS 
3.1 Typical Systems in US and Europe 
Recently anumber of sites have been working 
on human-computer dialogue systems. The 
followings are typical examples. 
(a) The View4You system 
at the Un ivers i ty  of 
Karksruhe 
The University of Karlsruhe 
focuses its speech research 
on a content-addressable 
multimedia information 
retrieval system, under a 
multi-lingual environment, 
where  quer ies  and 
multimedia documents may 
appear  in mul t ip le  
languages \[7\]. The system is 
called "View4You" and 
their research is conducted 
in cooperation with the 
Informedia project at CMU 
\[6\]. In the View4You 
system, German and Servocroatian public 
newscasts are recorded aily. The newscasts are 
automatically segmented and an index is created 
for each of the segments by means of automatic 
speech recognition. The user can query the 
system in natural anguage by keyboard or 
through aspeech utterance. The system returns 
a list of segments which is sorted by relevance 
with respect to the user query. By selecting a
segment, he user can watch the corresponding 
part of the news show on his/her computer screen. 
The system overview is shown in Fig. 3. 
(b) The SCAN- speech content based audio 
navigator at AT&T Labs 
SCAN (Speech Content based Audio Navigator) 
is a spoken document retrieval system developed 
at AT&T Labs integrating speaker-independent, 
large-vocabulary speech recognition with 
information-retrieval to support query-based 
retrieval of information from speech archives \[8\]. 
Initial development focused on the application 
of SCAN to the broadcast news domain. An 
overview of the system architecture is provided 
in Fig. 4. The system consists of three 
components: (1) a speaker-independent large- 
vocabulary speech recognition engine which

subcomponents preprocess the speech data before 
passing the speech to the recognizer itself. 
(c )  The  
GALAXY- I I  
conversat ional  
system at MIT 
Galaxy is a client- 
server architecture 
developed at MIT 
for accessing on- 
line information 
us ing  spoken 
dialogue \[9\]. Ithas 
served  as the 
tes tbed  fo r  
developing human 
language 
Phone 
technology atMIT for several 
years. Recently, they have 
initiated a significant redesign 
of the GALAXY architecture 
to make it eas ie r  for 
researchers to develop their 
own applications, using either 
exclusively their own servers 
or intermixing them with 
servers developed by others. 
This redesign was done in part 
due to the fact that GALAXY 
has been designed as the first 
reference architecture for the 
new DARPA Communicator program. The 
resulting configuration of the GALAXY-II 
architecture is shown in Fig. 5. The boxes in 
this figure represent various human language 
technology servers as well as information and 
domain servers. The label in italics next to each 
box identifies the corresponding MIT system 
component. Interactions between servers are 
mediated by the hub and managed in the hub 
script. A particular dialogue session is initiated 
by a user either through interaction with a 
graphical interface at a Web site, through direct 
telephone dialup, or through adesktop agent.

(d) The ARISE train travel information 
system at LIMSI 
The ARISE (Automatic Railway Information 
Systems for Europe) projects aims developing 
prototype telephone information services for train 
travel information i  several European countries 
\[ 10\]. In collaboration with the Vecsys company 
and with the SNCF (the French Railways), 
LIMSI has developed a prototype telephone 
service providing timetables, imulated fares and 
reservations, and information on reductions and 
services for the main French intercity 
connections. A prototype French/English service 
for the high speed trains between Paris and 
London is also under development. The system 
is based on the spoken language systems 
developed for the RailTel project \[11\] and the 
ESPRIT Mask project \[12\]. Compared to the 
RailTel system, the main advances inARISE are 
in dialogue management, confidence measures, 
inclusion of optional spell mode for ci, ty/station 
names, and barge-in capability to allow more 
natural interaction between the user and the 
machine. 
3.2 Designing a Multimodal Dialogue System 
for Information Retrieval 
We have recently investigated a paradigm for 
designing multimodal dialogue systems \[13\]. An 
example task of the system was to retrieve 
particular information about different shops in 
the Tokyo Metropolitan area, such as their names, 
addresses and phone numbers. The system 
accepted speech and screen touching as input, 
and presented retrieved information on a screen 
display or by synthesized speech as shown in Fig. 
6. The speech recognition part was modeled by 
the FSN (finite state network) consisting of 
keywords and fillers, both of which were 
implemented by the DAWG (directed acyclic 
word-graph) structure. The number ofkeywords 
was 306, consisting of district names and 
business names. The fillers accepted roughly 
100,000 non-keywords/phrases occuring in 
spontaneous speech. A variety of dialogue 
strategies were designed and evaluated based on 
an objective cost function having a set of actions 
and states as parameters. Expected ialogue cost 
The speech recognizer uses 
n-gram backoff language 
models estimated on the 
transcriptions of spoken 
queries. Since the amount 
of language model training 
data is smal l ,  some 
grammatical c asses, such 
as cities, days and months, 
are used to provide more 
robust estimates of the n- 
gram probabilities. A

instantaneous/incremental ad ptation is ideal, 
since the system works as if it were a speaker- 
independent system, and it performs increasingly 
better as it is used. However, since we have to 
adapt many phonemes using a limited size of 
utterances including only a limited number of 
phonemes, it is crucial to use reasonable 
modeling of speaker-to-speaker variablity or 
constraints. Modeling of the mechanism of 
speech production is expected to provide a useful 
modeling of speaker-to-speaker va iability. 
4.2 On-line speaker adaptation in broadcast 
news dictation 
Since, in broadcast news, each speaker utters 
several sentences in succession, the recognition 
error rate can be reduced by adapting acoustic 
models incrementally within a segment hat 
contains only one speaker. We applied on-line, 
unsupervised, instantaneous and incremental 
speaker adaptation combined with automatic 
detection of speaker changes \[4\]. The MLLR \[ 15\] 
-MAP \[ 16\] and VFS (vector-field smoothing) 
\[17\] methods were instantaneously and 
incrementally carried out for each utterance. The 
adaptation process is as follows. For the first 
input utterance, the speaker-independ?nt model 
is used for both recognition and adaptation, and 
the first speaker-adapted model is created. For 
the second input utterance, the likelihood value 
of the utterance given the speaker-independent 
model and that given the speaker-adapted model 
are calculated and compared. If the former value 
is larger, the utterance is considered to be the 
beginning of a new speaker, and another speaker- 
adapted model is created. Otherwise, the existing 
speaker-adapted model is incrementally adapted. 
For the succeeding input utterances, peaker 
changes are detected in the same way by 
comparing the acoustic likelihood values of each 
utterance obtained from the speaker-independent 
model and some speaker-adapted models. If the 
speaker-independent model yields a larger 
likelihood than any of the speaker-adapted 
models, a speaker change is detected and a new 
speaker-adapted model is constructed. 
Experimental results show that the adaptation 
reduced the word error rate by 11.8 % relative to 
the speaker-independent models. 
5. PRESPECTIVES OF LANGUAGE 
MODELING 
5.1 Language modeling for spontaneous 
speech recognition 
One of the most important issues for speech 
recognition is how to create language models 
(rules) for spontaneous peech. When 
recognizing spontaneous speech in dialogues, it
is necessary to deal with variations that are not 
encountered when recognizing speech that is read 
from texts. These variations include extraneous 
words, out-of-vocabulary words, ungrammatical 
sentences, disfluency, partial words, repairs, 
hesitations, and repetitions. It is crucial to 
develop robust and flexible parsing algorithms 
that match the characteristics of spontaneous 
speech. A paradigm shift from the present 
transcription-based approach to a detection-based 
approach will be important to solve such 
problems \[2\]. How to extract contextual 
information, predict users' responses, and focus 
on key words are very important issues. 
Stochastic language modeling, such as bigrams 
and trigrams, has been a very powerful tool, so 
it would be very effective to extend its utility by 
incorporating semantic knowledge. It would also 
be useful to integrate unification grammars and 
context-free grammars for efficient word 
prediction. Style shifting is also an important 
problem in spontaneous speech recognition. In 
typical laboratory experiments, peakers are 
reading lists of words rather than trying to 
accomplish a real task. Users actually trying to 
accomplish a task, however, use a different 
linguistic style. Adaptation of linguistic models 
according to tasks, topics and speaking styles is 
a very important issue, since collecting a large 
linguistic database for every new task is difficult 
and costly. 
18 
5.2 Message-Driven Speech Recognit ion 
State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition 
systems employ the criterion of maximizing 
P(/4,qX), where W is a word sequence, and X is 
an acoustic observation sequence. This criterion 
is reasonable for dictating read speech. However, 
the ultimate goal of automatic speech recognition 
is to extract he underlying messages of the 
speaker f om the speech signals. Hence we need 
to model the process of speech generation and 
recognition as shown in Fig. 9 \[ 18\], where M is 
the message (content) hat a speaker intended to 
convey. 
models in the same way as in usual recognition 
processes. We assume that P(M) has a uniform 
probability for all M. Therefore, we only need to 
consider further the term P(~M).  We assume 
that P (~M)  can be expressed as follows.

According to this model, the speech recognition 
process is represented as the maximization fthe 
following a posteriori probability \[4\]\[5\],

where ~, 0<-/1.<1, is a weighting factor. P(W), 
the first term of the right hand side, represents a 
part of P (~M)  that is independent of Mand can 
be given by a general statistical language model. 
P'(WIM), the second term of the right hand side, 
represents he part ofP(WIA D that depends on 
M. We consider that M is 
represented bya co-occurrence 
of  words  based on the 
distributional hypothesis by 
Harris \[ 19\]. Since this approach 
formulates P'(WIM) without 
explicitly representing M, it can 
use information about the 
speaker's message M without 
be ing  a f fec ted  by the 
quantization problem of topic 
classes. This new formulation 
of speech recognit ion was 
appl ied  to the Japanese 
broadcast news dictation, and it was found that 
word error rates for the clean set were slightly 
reduced by this method.

Using Bayes' rule, Eq. (1) can be expressed as

as

6. CONCLUSIONS 
Speech recognition technology has made a 
remarkable progress in the past 5 - 10 years. 
Based on the progress, various application 
systems have been developed using dictation and 
spoken dialogue technology. One of the most 
important applications i  information extraction 
and retrieval. Using the speech recognition 
technology, broadcast news can be automatically 
indexed, producing awide range of capabilities 
for browsing news archives interactively. Since 
speech is the most natural and eff icient 
communication method between humans, 
19 
automatic speech recognition will continue to 
find applications, uch as meeting/conference 
summarization, automatic closed captioning, and 
interpreting telephony. It is expected that speech 
recognizer will become the main input device of 
the "wearable" computers that are now actively 
investigated. In order to materialize these 
applications, we have to solve many problems. 
The most important issue is how to make the 
speech recognition systems robust against 
acoustic and lingustic variation in speech. In this 
context, aparadigm shitt from speech recognition 
to understanding where underlying messages of 
the speaker, that is, meaning/context that the 
speaker intended to convey are extracted, instead 
of transcribing all the spoken words, will be 
indispensable.
