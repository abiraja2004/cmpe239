Abstract
Efforts to automatically acquire world knowl-
edge from text suffer from the lack of an easy
means of evaluating the resulting knowledge.
We describe initial experiments using Mechan-
ical Turk to crowdsource evaluation to non-
experts for little cost, resulting in a collection
of factoids with associated quality judgements.
We describe the method of acquiring usable
judgements from the public and the impact
of such large-scale evaluation on the task of
knowledge acquisition.
1 Introduction
The creation of intelligent artifacts that can achieve
human-level performance at problems like question-
answering ultimately depends on the availability of
considerable knowledge. Specifically, what is needed
is commonsense knowledge about the world in a form
suitable for reasoning. Open knowledge extraction
(Van Durme and Schubert, 2008) is the task of mining
text corpora to create useful, high-quality collections
of such knowledge.
Efforts to encode knowledge by hand, such as Cyc
(Lenat, 1995), require expensive man-hours of labor
by experts. Indeed, results from Project Halo (Fried-
land et al, 2004) suggest that properly encoding the
(domain-specific) knowledge from just one page of a
textbook can cost $10,000. OKE, on the other hand,
creates logical formulas automatically from existing
stores of human knowledge, such as books, newspa-
pers, and the Web. And while crowdsourced efforts to
gather knowledge, such as Open Mind (Singh, 2002),
learn factoids people come up with off the tops of
their heads to contribute, OKE learns from what peo-
ple normally write about and thus consider important.
Open knowledge extraction differs from open infor-
mation extraction (Banko et al, 2007) in the focus
on everyday, commonsense knowledge rather than
specific facts, and on the logical interpretability of
the outputs. While an OIE system might learn that
Tolstoy wrote using a dip pen, an OKE system would
prefer to learn that an author may write using a pen.
An example of an OKE effort is the KNEXT sys-
tem1 (Schubert, 2002), which uses compositional se-
mantic interpretation rules to produce logical formu-
las from the knowledge implicit in parsed text. These
formulas are then automatically expressed as English-
like ?factoids?, such as ?A PHILOSOPHER MAY HAVE
A CONVICTION? or ?NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE LIKELY
TO GO ON FOR SOME HOURS?.
While it is expected that eventually sufficiently
clean knowledge bases will be produced for infer-
ences to be made about everyday things and events,
currently the average quality of automatically ac-
quired knowledge is not good enough to be used in
traditional reasoning systems. An obstacle for knowl-
edge extraction is the lack of an easy method for
evaluating ? and thus improving ? the quality of re-
sults. Evaluation in acquisition systems is typically
done by human judging of random samples of output,
usually by the reporting authors themselves (e.g., Lin
and Pantel, 2002; Schubert and Tong, 2003; Banko et
al., 2007). This is time-consuming, and it has the po-
tential for bias: it would be preferable to have people
other than AI researchers label whether an output is
commonsense knowledge or not. We explore the use
of Amazon?s Mechanical Turk service, an online la-
bor market, as a means of acquiring many non-expert
judgements for little cost.
2 Related Work
While Open Mind Commons (Speer, 2007) asks users
to vote for or against commonsense statements con-
tributed by others users in order to come to a consen-
sus, we seek to evaluate an automatic system. Snow
et al (2008) compared the quality of labels produced
by non-expert Turkers against those made by experts
for a variety of NLP tasks and found that they re-
quired only four responses per item to emulate expert
annotations. Kittur et al (2008) describe the use and

The statement above is a reasonably clear, entirely
plausible, generic claim and seems neither too spe-
cific nor too general or vague to be useful:

? I lean towards agreement.
? I?m not sure.
? I lean towards disagreement.

users. These results contribute to our methods below.
3 Experiments
Previous evaluations of KNEXT output have tried to
judge the relative quality of knowledge learned from
different sources and by different techniques. Here
the goal is simply to see whether the means of evalu-
ation can be made to work reasonably, including at
what scale it can be done for limited cost. For these
experiments, we relied on $100 in credit provided by
Amazon as part of the workshop shared task. This
amount was used for several small experiments in or-
der to empirically estimate what $100 could achieve,
given a tuned method of presentation and evaluation.
We took a random selection of factoids generated
from the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium,
2001), split into sets of 20, and removed those most
easily filtered out as probably being of low quality
or malformed. We skipped the more stringent filters
(originally created for dealing with noisy Web text),
leaving more variety in the quality of the factoids
Turkers were asked to rate.
The first evaluation followed the format of previ-
ous, offline ratings. For each factoid, Turkers were
given the instructions and choices in Fig. 1, where
the options correspond in our analysis to the num-
bers 1?5, with 1 being agreement. To help Turkers
make such judgements, they were given a brief back-
ground statement: ?We?re gathering the sort of every-
day, commonsense knowledge an intelligent computer
system should know. You?re asked to rate several pos-
sible statements based on how well you think they
meet this goal.? Mason and Watts (2009) suggest that
while money may increase the number and speed of
responses, other motivations such as wanting to help
with something worthwhile or interesting are more
likely to lead to high-quality responses.
Participants were then shown the examples and
explanations in Fig. 2. Note that while they are told
some categories that bad factoids can fall into, the
Turkers are not asked to make such classifications
Examples of good statements:
? A SONG CAN BE POPULAR
? A PERSON MAY HAVE A HEAD
? MANEUVERS MAY BE HOLD -ED IN SECRET
It?s fine if verb conjugations are not attached or are a bit
unnatural, e.g. ?hold -ed? instead of ?held?.
Examples of bad statements:
? A THING MAY SEEK A WAY
This is too vague. What sort of thing? A way for/to
what?
? A COCKTAIL PARTY CAN BE AT
SCOTCH_PLAINS_COUNTRY_CLUB
This is too specific. We want to know that a cocktail
party can be at a country club, not at this particular one.
The underscores are not a problem.
? A PIG MAY FLY
This is not literally true even though it happens to be an
expression.
? A WORD MAY MEAN
This is missing information. What might a word mean?

themselves, as this is a task where even experts have
low agreement (Van Durme and Schubert, 2008).
An initial experiment (Round 1) only required
Turkers to have a high (90%) approval rate. Under
these conditions, out of 100 HITs2, 60 were com-
pleted by participants whose IP addresses indicated
they were in India, 38 from the United States, and
2 from Australia. The average Pearson correlation
between the ratings of different Indian Turkers an-
swering the same questions was a very weak 0.065,
and between the Indian responders and those from
the US and Australia was 0.132. On the other hand,
the average correlation among non-Indian Turkers
was 0.508, which is close to the 0.6?0.8 range seen
between the authors in the past, and which can be
taken as an upper bound on agreement for the task.
Given the sometimes subtle judgements of mean-
ing required, being a native English speaker has pre-
viously been assumed to be a prerequisite. This differ-
ence in raters? agreements may thus be due to levels
of language understanding, or perhaps to different
levels of attentiveness to the task. However, it does
not seem to be the case that the Indian respondents
rushed: They took a median time of 201.5 seconds
(249.18 avg. with a high standard deviation of 256.3s
? some took more than a minute per factoid). The non-
Indian responders took a median time of just 115.5 s
(124.5 avg., 49.2 std dev.).
Regardless of the cause, given these results, we re-
stricted the availability of all following experiments
to Turkers in the US.Ideally we would include other
English-speaking countries, but there is no straight-

In this case, each HIT was a set of twenty factoids to be rated.

forward way to set multiple allowable countries on
Mechanical Turk.When Round 2 was posted with
a larger set of factoids to be rated and the location
requirement, responses fell off sharply, leading us
to abort and repost with a higher payrate (7? for 20
factoids vs 5? originally) in Round 3.
To avoid inaccurate ratings, we rejected submis-
sions that were improbably quick or were strongly
uncorrelated with other Turkers? responses. We col-
lected five Turkers? ratings for each set of factoids,
and for each persons? response to a HIT computed
the average of their three highest correlations with
others? responses. We then rejected if the correla-
tions were so low as to indicate random responses.
The scores serve a second purpose of identifying a
more trustworthy subset of the responses. (A cut-off
score of 0.3 was chosen based on hand-examination.)
In Table 1, we can see that these more strongly corre-
lated responses rate factoids as slightly worse overall,
possibly because those who either casual or uncertain
are more likely to judge favorably on the assumption
that this is what the task authors would prefer, or they
are simply more likely to select the top-most option,
which was ?I agree?.
An example of a factoid that was labeled incor-
rectly by one of the filtered out users is ?A PER-
SON MAY LOOK AT SOME THING-REFERRED-TO OF
PRESS RELEASES?, for which a Turker from Madras
in Round 1 selected ?I agree?. Factoids containing
the vague ?THING-REFERRED-TO? are often filtered
out of our results automatically, but leaving them in
gave us some obviously bad inputs for checking Turk-
ers? responses. Another (US) Turker chose ?I agree?
when told ?TES MAY HAVE 1991ES? but ?I disagree?
when shown ?A TRIP CAN BE TO A SUPERMARKET?.
We are interested not only in whether there is a gen-
eral consensus to be found among the Turkers but also
how that consensus correlates with the judgements
of AI researchers. To this end, one of the authors
rated five sets (100 factoids) presented in Round 3,

which yielded an average correlation between all the
Turkers and the author of 0.507, which rises slightly
to 0.532 if we only count those Turkers considered
?highly correlated? as described above.
As another test of agreement, for ten of the sets in
Round 3, two factoids were designated as fixpoints ?
the single best and worst factoid in the set, assigned
ratings 1 and 5 respectively. From the Turkers who
rated these factoids, 65 of the 100 ratings matched
the researchers? designations and 77 were within one
point of the chosen rating.3
A few of the Turkers who participated had fairly
strong negative correlations to the other Turkers, sug-
gesting that they may have misunderstood the task
and were rating backwards.4 Furthermore, one Turker
commented that she was unsure whether the state-
ment she was being asked to agree with (Fig. 1) ?was
a positive or negative?. To see how it would affect the
results, we ran (as Round 4) twenty sets of factoids,
asking simplified question ?Do you agree this is a
good statement of general knowledge?? The choices
were also reversed in order, running from ?I disagree?
to ?I agree? and color-coded, with agree being green
and disagree red. This corresponded to the coloring
of the good and bad examples at the top of the page,
which the Turkers were told to reread when they were
halfway through the HIT. The average correlation for
responses in Round 4 was 0.47, which is an improve-
ment over the 0.34 avg. correlation of Round 3.
Using the same format as Round 4, we ran factoids
from two other corpora. Round 6 consisted of 300 ran-
dom factoids taken from running KNEXT on weblog
data (Gordon et al, 2009) and Round 7 300 random
factoids taken from running KNEXT on Wikipedia.
3If we only look at the highly correlated responses, this in-
creases slightly to 68% exact match, 82% within one point.
4This was true for one Turker who completed many HITs, a
problem that might be prevented by accepting/rejecting HITs as
soon as all scores for that set of factoids were available rather
than waiting for the entire experiment to finish.
161
The average ratings for factoids from these sources
are lower than for the BNC, reflecting the noisy na-
ture of much writing on weblogs and the many overly
specific or esoteric factoids learned from Wikipedia.
The results achieved can be quite sensitive to the
display of the task. For instance, the frequency of
ratings in Fig. 3 shows that Turkers tended toward
the extremes: ?I agree? and ?I disagree? but rarely
?I?m not sure?. This option might have a negative
connotation (?Waffling is undesirable?) that another
phrasing would not. As an alternative presentation of
the task (Round 5), for 300 factoids, we asked Turk-
ers to first decide whether a factoid was ?incoher-
ent (not understandable)? and, otherwise, whether it
was ?bad?, ?not very good?, ?so-so?, ?not so bad?, or
?good? commonsense knowledge. Turkers indicated
factoids were incoherent 14% of the time, with a cor-
responding reduction in the number rated as ?bad?,
but no real increase in middle ratings. The average
ratings for the ?coherent? factoids are in Table 1.
4 Uses of Results
Beyond exploring the potential of Mechanical Turk
as a mechanism for evaluating the output of KNEXT
and other open knowledge extraction systems, these
experiments have two useful outcomes:
First, they give us a large collection of almost 3000
factoids that have associated average ratings and al-
low for the release of the subset of those factoids
that are believed to probably be good (rated 1?2).
This data set is being publicly released at http://
www.cs.rochester.edu/research/knext, and
it includes a wide range of factoids, such as ?A REP-
RESENTATION MAY SHOW REALITY? and ?DEMON-
STRATIONS MAY MARK AN ANNIVERSARY OF AN
UPRISING?.
Second, the factoids rated from Round 2 onward
were associated with the KNEXT extraction rules used
to generate them: The factoids generated by different
rules have average ratings from 1.6 to 4.8. We hope in
future to use this data to improve KNEXT?s extraction
methods, improving or eliminating rules that often
produce factoids judged to be bad. Inexpensive, fast
evaluation of output on Mechanical Turk could be a
way to measure incremental improvements in output
quality coming from the same source.
5 Conclusions
These initial experiments have shown that untrained
Turkers evaluating the natural-language verbaliza-
tions of an open knowledge extraction system will
generally give ratings that correlate strongly with
those of AI researchers. Some simple methods were
described to find those responses that are likely to
be accurate. This work shows promise for cheap and
quick means of measuring the quality of automati-
cally constructed knowledge bases and thus improv-
ing the tools that create them.
