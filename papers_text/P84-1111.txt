1. INTRODUCTION 
Syntactical amblgulty, as part of the ambigui- 
ty problem in general, is widely recognized as a 
major  d i f f i cu l ty  in  MT. To so lve  th i s  p rob lem,  the  
efforts of computational linguists have been main- 
ly d i rected  to  the  process  o f  ana lys i s :  a un ique  
ana lys i s  i s  searched (semant ica l  and/or  wor ld  
knowledge in format ion  be ing  bas ica l ly  employed to  
th i s  end) ,  and  on ly  hav ing  obta ined  such  an  ana-  
lys i s ,  i t  i s  p roceeded to  the  process  o f  synthes is .  
On th i s  approach ,  in  add i t ion  to  the  we l l  known 
d i f f i cu l t ies  o f  genera l - l ingu is t i c  and  computa-  
t iona l  character ,  there  are  two pr inc ip le  embarras -  
ments  to  he  encountered .  I t  makes  us  ent i re ly  in -  
capab le  to  process ,  f i r s t ,  sentences  w i th  "unre -  
so lvab le  syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty"  (w i th  respect  to  
the  d isambiguat ion  in format ion  s tored) ,  and ,  se -  
cond ly ,  sentences  wh ich  must  he  t rans la ted  ambi -  
guous ly  (e .g .  puns  and  the  l i ke ) .  
In  th i s  paper ,  the  burden o f  so lu t ion  o f  the  
syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty  prob lem i s  sh i f ted  f rom the  
domain  o f  ana lys i s  to  the  domain  o f  synthes is  o f  
sentences .  Thus ,  ins tead  o f  t ry ing  to  reso lve  such  
ambigu i t ies  in  the  source  language (SL) ,  syntac -  
t i ca l ly  ambiguous  sentences  are  synthes ized  in  the  
ta rget  language (TL) wh ich  preserve  the i r  ambigu i -  
ty ,  so  that  the  user  h imse l f  ra ther  than  the  par -  
ser  d i sambiguates  the  ambigu i t ies  in  quest ion .  
This way of handling syntactical ambiguity 
may be viewed as an illustration of a more gene- 
ral approach, outlined earlier (Penchev and Perl- 
cliev 1982, Pericliev 1983, Penchev and Perlcllev 
1984), concerned a lso  w i th  o ther  types  o f  ambt -  
guitles in the SL translated by means of syntacti- 
cal, and not  on ly  syntact i ca l ,  ambigu i ty  in the  
TL. 
In  th i s  paper ,  we w i l l  concent ra te  on  the  
l ingu is t i cs  ~rounds  fo r  adopt ing  such  a manner  o f

genera l ,  unab le  to  make a dec is ion  as  to  wh ich  o f  
these  parses  "make sense" .  Our  approach  w i l l  be  
an  obv ious  way out  o f  th i s  s i tuat ion .  And i t  i s  in

There  are  two fur ther  po in ts  that  shou ld  be

3. THE DESCRIPTION OF SYNTACTICAL AMBIGUITY 
IN ENGLISH AND BULGARIAN 
The empirical basis of the approach is provi- 
ded by an extensive study of syntactical ambiguity 
in English and Bulgarlan (Pericliev 19835, accom- 
plished within the framework of a version of de- 
pendency grammar using dependency arcs and bra- 
cketlngs. In this study, from a given llst of con- 
figurations for each language, all logically-ad- 
mlssible ambiguous strings of three types in En- 
gllsh and Bulgarian were calculated. The first 
type of syntactlcally ambiguous strings is of the 
form: 
(15 A ~L~B,  e.g. 
adv.mod(how long?)  
f 
The s ta t i s t i c ian  s tud ied(V)  the  ~ho le  year (PP) ,  
ob j .d i r (wh~t? )  
where A, B, . . .  a re  complexes  o f  word -c lasses ,  
" - - -~"  i s  a dependency  arc ,  and 1, 2, . . .  a re  syn-  
tac t i ca l  re la t ions .  
The second type  i s  o f  the  form:  
(2) A -~->B<-~- C, e.g. 
adv.mod(how?) 
She greeted(V) the g i r l (N)  ~ i th  a smil6(PP) 
at t r ib (what? )  
The th i rd  type  i s  o f  the  form: 
(3) A -!-~B~-~- C, e.g .  
adv.mod(how?)  
\[ 
He fa i led(V)  ent t re ly (Adv)  to  cheat (V in  f )  her

rea l i zed  in  both  languages  (c f .  the  same resu l t  a l -  
so  fo r  Russ ian  in  Jo rdanska Ja  (1967)5 .  Second ly ,  
and more impor tant ,  there  tu rned  out  to  be a s t r i -

4. TRANSLATIONAL PROBLEMS 
With a view to the aims of translation, it 
was convenient to distinguish two cases: Case A, in 
which to each syntactically ambiguous string in En- 
glish corresponds a syntactically ambiguous string 
in Bulgarlan, and Case B, in which to some English 
strings do not correspond any Bulgarian ones; 
Case A provides a possibility for literal English 
into Bulgarian translation, while there is no such 
possibillty for sentences containing strings 
classed under Case B. 
4.1. Case A: Literal Translation 
English strings which can be literally tran- 
slated into Bulgarian comprise,roughly speaking, 
the majority and the most common of strings to 
appear In real English texts. Informally, these 
strings can be included into several large groups 
of syntactically ambiguous constructions, such as 
constructions with "floating" word-classes (Ad- 
verbs, Prepositional Phrases, etc. acting as slaves 
either to one, or to another master-word), constru- 
ctions with  prepos i t iona l  and post -pos i t iona l  ad -  
juncts  to  con jo ined  groups ,  const ruc t ions  w i th  se -  
vera l  con jo ined  members ,  const ruc t ions  w i th  symmet-  
r i ca l  p red icates ,  some e l l ip t i ca l  const ruc t ions ,  
e tc .  
Due to  space  l im i ta t ions ,  a few Eng l i sh  phra -  
ses  w i th  the i r  l i te ra l  t rans la t ions  w i l l  su f f i ce  
as an i l l us t ra t ion  o f  Case A. (Fur ther  on,  syntac -  
t i ca l  relations as labels of arcs will be omitted 
where superfluous in marking the ambiguity):

4.2 .  Case  B :  Non-L i te ra l  T rans la t ion  
Eng l i sh  s t r ings  which cannot  be l i te ra l ly  
t rans la ted  in to  Bu lgar ian  are  such s t r ings  which 
conta in :  ( i )  word -c lasses  (V i f Gerund) not  p re -  n ' sent in Bulgarian, and/or (ii) syntactical 
relations (e.g. "composite": language~-~ -- theory, 
etc.) not present in Bulgarian, and/or (iii) other 
differences (in global syntactical organization, 
agreement ,  e tc .  ) .  
It will be shown how certain English strings 
falling under this heading are related to Bulgarian 
strings preserving their ambiguity. A way to over- 
come difficulties with (il) and (iii) is exempli- 
fied on a very common (complex) string, vlz. 
Adj/N/Prt+N/N's+N (e.g. stylish ~entlemen's suits). 
As an illustration, here we confine to prob- 
lems to be met with (i), and, more concretely, to 
such English strings containing Vin f. These strings 
are mapped onto Bulgarian strings containing 
da-construction or a verbal noun (V i ~ generally 
b-eeing translated either way). E.g. nXthe Vln f in 
obj. dlr 
(8) a. He promised(V) to  p lease(V in  f )  mother  
t . _ J I  . eL. 
adv. mod 
(promised what or why?) is rendered by a da-con- 
struction in agreement with the subject, preserving 
the ambigu i ty :  
ob j .  d i r  
~,'" I \[  ~1 ' 
zaradva(da-const  r)  objelht a (V) da b. T~J . ~ I _ _  m~Jka 
adv. mod 
In the  s t r ing  
a t t r ib  
(9) a. ~ have(V)jl, instruct ions(N)~, toj s t~dy(V in  f ) j  
obJ.dlr 
(what ins t ruct ions  or  I have to  s tudy  what?)  V. _ 
can be rendered  a l te rnat ive ly  by a d_~a-construc ~nz- 
t ion  or  by a prepos i t iona l  verba l  noun: 
a t t r ib  
b. AZ imam(V) lns t rukts i i (N)  da ucha(d__aa-constr) 
ohj d i r  
at t r ib  
c.  ins t rukts i i (N)  za uchene(PrVblN) 
obj. dl r J 
Yet in other  s t r ings ,  e .g .  The chicken(N)  is 
ready(Adj) to eat(V. .) (the chicken eats or is 
eaten . ) ,  in order  to  preserve  the ambigu i ty  the 
in f in i t i ve  shou ld  be rendered  by a prepos i t iona l  
verba l  noun: P i le to (N)  e gotovo(AdJ )  z_~a jadene 
(PrVblN),  ra ther  than wi th  the f in i te  da -const ruc -  
t ion ,  s ince  in the la t te r  case we would obta in  
two unambiguous t rans la t ions :  P i le to  e gotovo d a 
~ade ( the  ch icken eats )  or  P i le to  e got  ovo da se 
~ade ( the  ch icken i s  eaten) ,  and so on. 
For  some Eng l i sh  s t r ings  no syntact i ca l ly  am- 
b iguous  Bu lgar ian  s t r ings  could  be put  in to  cor res -  
pondence,  so  that  a t rans la t ion  wi th  our method 
proved to  be an imposs ib i l i ty .  E .g .  
p red icat ive  
V~--7 I\[ ob~ .dir ~ 
(I0) He found(V) the mechanic(N) a helper(N) 
~ J l~b J . ind i r  ~ t 
ob J .d i r  
(e i ther  the mechanic o r  someone e lse  i s  the  he lper )  
i s  such a sentence  due to  the imposs ib i l i ty  in  Bul -  
gar ian~r  two non-prepos i t iona l  ob jec ts ,  a d i rec t  
and an ind i rec t  one, to  appear  in  a sentence .  
4 .3 .  Mul~,,iple Syntact i ca l  Ambiguity 
Many very  f requent ly  encountered  cases  of  mul-  
t ip le  syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty  can a l so  be handled 
success fu l ly  w i th in  th i s  approach.  E .g .  a phrase  
l i ke  Cybernet ica l  dev ices  and sys tems fo r  automat ic  
cont ro l  and d ia~nos is  in  b iomedic ine  w i th  more than 
30 poss ib le  pars ings  i s  amenable to l i te ra l  t rans -  
la t ion  in to  Bu lgar ian .  
4 .4 .  Semant ica l ly  I r re levant  Syntact i ca l  
Ambi~uity 
D isambiguat ing  syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty  i s  an im- 
por tant  task  in MT on ly  because  d i f fe rent  meanings 
are  usua l ly  assoc ia ted  wi th  the d i f fe rent  syntac -  
t i ca l  descr ip t ions .  Th is ,  however,  i s  not  a lways 
the  case .  There are  some const ruct ions  in  Eng l i sh  
the  syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty  of  which cannot  lead to  
mul t ip le  unders tand ing .  E .g .  in  sentences  of  the 
form A i s  not  B (He i s  not  happy) ,  in  which the ad- 
verb ia l  par t i c le  not  i s  e i ther  a verba l  negat ion  
(He i sn ' t  happy) or  a non-verba l  negat ion  (He 's  not  
happy) ,  the d i f fe rent  syntact i ca l  t rees  w i l l  be in -  
te rpreted  semant ica l ly  as synonymous: 'A i s  not  B' 
~-==~A i s  not -B ' .  
523 
We should not worry about finding Bulgarlan 
syntactically ambiguous correspondences for such 
Eng l i sh  const ruct ions .  We can choose  arb i t ra r i l y  
one analysis, since either of the syntactical des- 
criptions will provide correct information for 
our translational purposes. Indeed, the construc- 
tion above has no ambiguous Bulgarian correspon- 
dence: in Bulgarian the negating particle combines 
e i ther  w i th  the  verb  ( then  i t  i s  wr i t ten  as a se -  
parate  word) or  w i th  the  ad jec t ive  ( in  which  case  
i t  i s  p re f ixed  to  i t ) .  E i ther  const ruct ion ,  how- 
ever ,  w i l l  y ie ld  a cor rec t  t rans la t ion :  To~ nee  == - -  
radosten  or  To~ e neradosten .

Cer ta in  d i f f i cu l t ies  may ar i se ,  hav ing  managed 
to  map Eng l i sh  syntact i ca l l y  ambiguous s t r ings  onto

lexemes  in  compar i son  to  the i r  Bu lgar ian  equ iva -

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
To conclude, some syntactically ambiguous 
strings in English can have literal, others non-ll- 
teral, and still others do not have any correspon- 
dences in Bulgarian. In summary, from a total num- 
ber of approximately 200 simple strings treated in 
Engllsh more than 3/4 can, and only 1/4 cannot, be 
literally translated; about half of the latter 
strings can be put into correspondence with syntac- 
tically ambiguous strings in Bulgarian preserving 
their ambiguity. This gives quite a strong support 
to the usefulness of our approach in an English in- 
to Bulgarian translation system. 
Severa l  advantages  o f  th i s  way of  hand l ing  of  
syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty  can be ment ioned .  
First, in the processing of the majority of 
syntactically ambiguous sentences within an En- 
glish into Bulgarian translation system it dispen- 
ses with semantical and world knowledge information 
at the very low cost of studying the ambiguity co- 
rrespondences in both languages. It could be expec- 
ted that investigations along this line will prove 
to be frultful for other pairs of languages as 
well. 
Second ly ,  whenever  th i s  way o f  hand l ing  syn-  
tac t i ca l  ambigu i ty  i s  app l i cab le ,  the  imposs ib i l i -  
ty  o f  p rev ious  approaches  to  t rans la te  sentences  
w i th  unreso lvab le  ambigu i ty ,  or  such  w i th  verba l  
Jokes  and the  l i ke ,  tu rns  out  to  be an eas i ly  
a t ta inab le  task .  
Th i rd ly ,  the  approach  seems to  have  a very  na -  
tu ra l  ex tens ion  to  another  p r inc ipa l  d i f f i cu l ty  in  
MT, v i z .  core ference  (c f .  the  three-ways  ambigu i ty  
of J im h i t  John and then  he ( J im,  John or  ne i ther? )  
went away and the  same ambigu i ty  o f  tQ~ (=he) in  
i t s  l i te ra l  t rans la t ion  in to  Bu lgar ian :  D$im udar i  
DJon i togava  to j ( ? )  s i  o t ide) .  
And, finally, there is yet another reason for 
adopting the approach discussed here. Even if we 
choose to go another way and (somehow) dlsamblgu- 
ate sentences in the SL, almost certainly their 
translational equivalents will be again syntactl- 
ca l l y  ambiguous ,  and qu i te  probab ly  preserve  the  
very  ambigu i ty  we t r ied  to  reso lve .  In  th i s  sense ,  
fo r  the  purposes  of  MT (o r  o ther  man-or iented  
app l i ca t ions  of  CL) we need not  waste  our  e f fo r ts  
to  d i sambiguate  e .g .  sentences  l i ke  John h i t  the  
dog w i th  th___ee lon~ hat  or  John h i t  th____ee do~ wi th  the  
long  woo1, s ince ,  even i f  we have done that ,  the  
cor rec t  Bu lgar ian  t rans la t ions  o f  both  these  sen-  
tences  are  syntact i ca l l y  ambiguous in  exact ly  the  
same way, the  reso lu t ion  o f  ambigu i ty  thus  prov ing  
to  be an ent i re ly  super f luous  operat ion  (c f .  D~on 
udar i  kucheto  s da l~ata  pa lka  and Djon udar i  ku -  
cheto  s da l~ata  va lna) .
