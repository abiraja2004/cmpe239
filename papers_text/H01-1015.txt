ABSTRACT
This paper describes a dialogue act tagging scheme developed for
the purpose of providing finer-grained quantitative dialogue met-
rics for comparing and evaluating DARPA COMMUNICATOR spo-
ken dialogue systems. We show that these dialogue act metrics can
be used to quantify the amount of effort spent in a dialogue main-
taining the channel of communication or, establishing the frame
for communication, as opposed to actually carrying out the travel
planning task that the system is designed to support. We show that
the use of these metrics results in a 7% improvement in the fit in
models of user satisfaction. We suggest that dialogue act metrics
can ultimately support more focused qualitative analysis of the role
of various dialogue strategy parameters, e.g. initiative, across di-
alogue systems, thus clarifying what development paths might be
feasible for enhancing user satisfaction in future versions of these
systems.
1. INTRODUCTION
Recent research on dialogue is based on the assumption that di-
alogue acts provide a useful way of characterizing dialogue behav-
iors in human-human dialogue, and potentially in human-computer
dialogue as well [16, 27, 11, 7, 1]. Several research efforts have
explored the use of dialogue act tagging schemes for tasks such
as improving recognition performance [27], identifying important
parts of a dialogue [12], and as a constraint on nominal expres-
sion generation [17]. This paper reports on the development and
use of a dialogue act tagging scheme for a rather different task:
the evaluation and comparison of spoken dialogue systems in the
travel domain. We call this scheme DATE: Dialogue Act Tagging
for Evaluation.
Our research on the use of dialogue act tagging for evaluation
focuses on the corpus of DARPA COMMUNICATOR dialogues col-
lected in the June 2000 data collection [28]. This corpus consists of
662 dialogues from 72 users calling the nine different COMMUNI-
CATOR travel planning systems. Each system implemented a log-
file standard for logging system behaviors and calculating a set of
core metrics. Each system utterance and each recognizer result was
logged, and user utterances were transcribed and incorporated into
.
the logfiles. The logfile standard supported the calculation of met-
rics that were hypothesized to potentially affect the user?s percep-
tion of the system; these included task duration, per turn measures,
response latency measures and ASR performance measures. Each
dialogue was also hand labelled for task completion.
The hypothesis underlying our approach is that a system?s di-
alogue behaviors have a strong effect on the user?s perception of
the system. Yet the core metrics that were collected via the logfile
standard represent very little about dialogue behaviors. For exam-
ple, the logging counts system turns and tallies their average length,
but doesn?t distinguish turns that reprompt the user, or give in-
structions, from those that present flight information. Furthermore,
each COMMUNICATOR system had a unique dialogue strategy and a
unique way of achieving particular communicative goals. Thus, in
order to explore our hypothesis about the differential effect of these
strategies, we needed a way to characterize system dialogue behav-
iors that would capture such differences yet be applied uniformly to
all nine systems. While some sites logged system dialogue behav-
iors using site-specific dialogue act naming schemes, there existed
no scheme that could be applied across sites.
Our goal was thus to develop a dialogue act tagging scheme that
would capture important distinctions in this set of dialogues; these
distinctions must be useful for testing particular hypotheses about
differences among dialogue systems. We also believed that it was
important for our tagging scheme to allow for multiple views of
each dialogue act. This would allow us, for example, to investigate
what part of the task an utterance contributes to separately from
what speech act function it serves. A central claim of the paper is
that these goals require a tagging scheme that makes distinctions
within three orthogonal dimensions of utterance classification: (1)
a SPEECH-ACT dimension; (2) a TASK-SUBTASK dimension; and
(3) a CONVERSATIONAL-DOMAIN dimension. Figure 1 shows a
COMMUNICATOR dialogue with each system utterance classified
on these three dimensions. The labels on each utterance are fully
described in the remainder of the paper.
Sections 2, 3, and 4, describe the three dimensions of DATE. In
these sections, we describe two aspects of our annotation scheme
that are not captured in existing tagging schemes, which we be-
lieve are important for characterizing how much effort in a dialogue
is devoted to the task versus different kinds of dialogue mainte-
nance. Section 5 describes how the dialogue act labels are assigned
to system utterances and section 6 discusses results showing that
the DATE dialogue act metrics improve models of user satisfaction
by an absolute 7% (an increase from 38% to 45%). The dialogueue
act metrics that are important predictors of user satisfaction are var-
ious kinds of meta-dialogue, apologies and acts that may be land-
marks for achieving particular dialogueue subtasks. In section 7 we
summarize the paper, discuss our claim that a dialogue annotation
scheme is a partial model of a natural class of dialogues, and dis-
cuss the ways in which the DATE scheme may be generalizable to
other dialogue corpora.
2. CONVERSATIONAL DOMAINS
The CONVERSATIONAL-DOMAIN dimension characterizes each
utterance as primarily belonging to one of three arenas of conver-
sational action. The first arena is the domain task, which in this
case is air travel booking, and which we refer to below as ABOUT-
TASK. The second domain of conversational action is the manage-
ment of the communication channel, which we refer to as ABOUT-
COMMUNICATION. This distinction has been widely adopted [19,
2, 9]. In addition, we identify a third domain of talk that we refer
to as ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME. This domain is particularly rel-
evant for distinguishing human-computer from human-human dia-
logues, and for distinguishing dialogue strategies across the 9 COM-
MUNICATOR systems. Each domain is described in this section.
2.1 About-Task
The ABOUT-TASK domain reflects the fact that many utterances
in a task-oriented dialogue originate because the goal of the dia-
logue is to complete a particular task to the satisfaction of both
participants. Typically an about-task utterance directly asks for or
presents task-related information, or offers a solution to a task goal.
As Figure 1 shows, most utterances are in the ABOUT-TASK di-
mension, reflecting the fact that the primary goal of the dialogue
is to collaborate on the task of making travel arrangements. The
task column of Figure 1 specifies the subtask that each task-related
utterance contributes to. DATE includes a large inventory of sub-
tasks in the task/subtask dimension in order to make fine-grained
distinctions regarding the dialogue effort devoted to the task or its
subcomponents. Section 4 will describe the task model in more
detail.
2.2 About-Communication
The ABOUT-COMMUNICATION domain reflects the system goal
of managing the verbal channel and providing evidence of what
has been understood [29, 8, 25]. Although utterances of this type
occur in human-human dialogue, they are more frequent in human-
computer dialogue, where they are motivated by the need to avoid
potentially costly errors arising from imperfect speech recognition.
In the COMMUNICATOR corpus, many systems use a conserva-
tive strategy of providing feedback indicating the system?s under-
standing of the information provided by the user after each user
turn. A typical example is the repetition of the origin and des-
tination cities in Figures 1 and 6. This type of repetition is the
IMPLICIT-CONFIRMATION speech-act (see Section 3 below). Some
systems used a variable confirmation strategy where some informa-
tion items may be confirmed as they are understood, but the system
requests explicit confirmation of all task parameters before search-
ing the database for matching flights. An example is in Figure 2.
Here the system asks for explicit confirmation in SYS3 before go-
ing to the database. This is the first opportunity that the user has
for making a correction, which he does in USER3. The system
then again asks for explicit confirmation of its new understanding,
which the user provides in USER4. After the user informs the sys-
tem that it is a one-way flight in USER6, the system accesses the
database. These explicit confirmations have the goal of avoiding
a costly database lookup, where the retrieval is conditioned on the
wrong parameters.
All implicit and explicit confirmation speech-acts are catego-
rized as ABOUT-COMMUNICATION because they are motivated by
the potential errors that the system might make in understanding

the caller, or in diagnosing the causes of misunderstandings. In
general, any utterance that reflects the system?s understanding of
something the user said is classified as ABOUT-COMMUNICATION.
A second set of ABOUT-COMMUNICATION utterances are APOLO-
GIES that the system makes for misunderstandings (see Section 3
below), i.e. utterances such as I?m sorry. I?m having trouble under-
standing you., or My mistake again. I didn?t catch that. or I can see
you are having some problems.
The last category of ABOUT-COMMUNICATION utterances are
the OPENINGS/CLOSINGS by which the system greets or says good-
bye to the caller. (Again, see Section 3 below.)
2.3 About Situation-Frame
The SITUATION-FRAME domain pertains to the goal of manag-
ing the culturally relevant framing expectations. The term is in-
spired by Goffman?s work on the organization and maintenance of
social interaction [13, 14]. An obvious example of a framing as-
sumption is that the language of the interaction will be English [13,
14]. Another is that there is an asymmetry between the knowledge
and/or agency of the system (or human travel agent) and that of the
user (or caller): the user cannot issue an airline ticket.
In developing the DATE tagging scheme, we compared human-
human travel planning dialogues collected by CMU with the human-
machine dialogues of the June 2000 data collection and noticed
a striking difference in the ABOUT-FRAME dimension. Namely,
very few ABOUT-FRAME utterances occur in the human-human di-
alogues, whereas they occur frequently enough in human-computer
dialogues that to ignore them is to risk obscuring significant differ-
ences in habitability of different systems. In other words, certain
differences in dialogue strategies across sites could not be fully rep-
resented without such a distinction. Figure 3 provides examples
motivating this dimension.
Dialogue acts that are ABOUT-FRAME are cross-classified as one
of three types of speech-acts, PRESENT-INFO, INSTRUCTION or
APOLOGY. They are not classified as having a value on the TASK-
SUBTASK dimension. Most of the ABOUT-FRAME dialogue acts
fall into the speech-act category of INSTRUCTIONS, utterances di-
rected at shaping the user?s behavior and expectations about how to
interact with a machine. Sites differ regarding how much instruc-
tion is provided up-front versus within the dialogue; most sites have
different utterance strategies for dialogue-initial versus dialogue-

fused at any point you can say start over to cancel your

medial instructions. One site gives minimal up-front framing in-
formation; further, the same utterances that can occur up-front also
occur dialogue-medially. A second site gives no up-front fram-
ing information, but it does provide framing information dialogue-
medially. Yet a third site gives framing information dialogue-initially,
but not dialogue-medially. The remaining sites provide different
kinds of general instructions dialogue-initially, e.g. (Welcome. ...You
may say repeat, help me out, start over, or, that?s wrong, you can
also correct and interrupt the system at any time.) versus dialogue-
medially: (Try changing your departure dates or times or a nearby
city with a larger airport.) This category also includes statements
to the user about the system?s capabilities. These occur in response
to a specific question or task that the system cannot handle: I can-
not handle rental cars or hotels yet. Please restrict your requests
to air travel. See Figure 3.
Another type of ABOUT-FRAME utterance is the system?s at-
tempt to disambiguate the user?s utterance; in response to the user
specifying Springfield as a flight destination, the system indicates
that this city name is ambiguous (I know of three Springfields, in
Missouri, Illinois and Ohio. Which one do you want?). The sys-
tem?s utterance communicates to the user that Springfield is am-
biguous, and goes further than a human would to clarify that there
are only three known options. It is important for evaluation pur-
poses to distinguish the question and the user?s response from a
simple question-answer sequence establishing a destination. A di-
rect question, such as What city are you flying to?, functions as a
REQUEST-INFO speech act and solicits information about the task.
The context here contrasts with a direct question in that the system
has already asked for and understood a response from the caller
about the destination city. Here, the function of the system turn is
to remediate the caller?s assumptions about the frame by indicating
the system?s confusion about the destination. Note that the question
within this pattern could easily be reformulated as a more typical
instruction statement, such as Please specify which Springfield you
mean, or Please say Missouri, Illinois or Ohio..
3. THE SPEECH-ACT DIMENSION
The SPEECH-ACT dimension characterizes the utterance?s com-
municative goal, and is motivated by the need to distinguish the
communicative goal of an utterance from its form. As an exam-
ple, consider the functional category of a REQUEST for information,
found in many tagging schemes that annotate speech-acts [24, 18,
6]. Keeping the functional category of a REQUEST separate from
the sentence modality distinction between question and statement
makes it possible to capture the functional similarity between ques-
tion and statement forms of requests, e.g., Can you tell me what
time you would like to arrive? versus Please tell me what time you
would like to arrive.
In DATE, the speech-act dimension has ten categories. We use
familiar speech-act labels, such as OFFER, REQUEST-INFO, PRESENT-
INFO, ACKNOWLEDGMENT, and introduce new ones designed to
help us capture generalizations about communicative behavior in
this domain, on this task, given the range of system and human
behavior we see in the data. One new one, for example, is STATUS-
REPORT, whose speech-act function and operational definition are
discussed below. Examples of each speech-act type are in Figure 4.
Speech-Act Example
REQUEST-INFO And, what city are you flying to?
PRESENT-INFO The airfare for this trip is 390 dollars.
OFFER Would you like me to hold this option?
ACKNOWLEDGMENT I will book this leg.
STATUS-REPORT Accessing the database; this might take a few sec-
onds.
EXPLICIT-
CONFIRM
You will depart on September 1st. Is that correct?
IMPLICIT-CONFIRM Leaving from Dallas.
INSTRUCTION Try saying a short sentence.
APOLOGY Sorry, I didn?t understand that.
OPENINGS/CLOSINGS Hello. Welcome to the C M U Communicator.
Figure 4: Example Speech Acts
In this domain, the REQUEST-INFO speech-acts are designed to
solicit information about the trip the caller wants to book, such as
the destination city (And what city are you flying to?), the desired
dates and times of travel (What date would you like to travel on), or
information about ground arrangements, such as hotel or car rental
(Will you need a hotel in Chicago?).
The PRESENT-INFO speech-acts also often pertain directly to the
domain task of making travel arrangements: the system presents
the user with a choice of itinerary (There are several flights from
Dallas Fort Worth to Salisbury Maryland which depart between
eight in the morning and noon on October fifth. You can fly on
American departing at eight in the morning or ten thirty two in the
morning, or on US Air departing at ten thirty five in the morning.),
as well as a ticket price (Ticket price is 495 dollars), or hotel or car
options.
OFFERS involve requests by the caller for a system action, such
as to pick a flight (I need you to tell me whether you would like to
take this particular flight) or to confirm a booking (If this itinerary
meets your needs, please press one; otherwise, press zero.) They
typically occur after the prerequisite travel information has been
obtained, and choices have been retrieved from the database.
The ACKNOWLEDGMENT speech act characterizes system utter-
ances that follow a caller?s acceptance of an OFFER, e.g. I will book
this leg or I am making the reservation.
The STATUS-REPORT speech-act is used to inform the user about
the status of the part of the domain task pertaining to the database
retrieval, and can include apologies, mollification, requests to be
patient, and so on. Their function is to let the user know what is
happening with the database lookup, whether there are problems
with it, and what types of problems. While the form of these acts
are typically statements, their communication function is different
than typical presentations of information; they typically function to
keep the user apprised of progress on aspects of the task that the
user has no direct information about, e.g. Accessing the database;
this might take a few seconds. There is also a politeness function
to utterances like Sorry this is taking so long, please hold., and
they often provide the user with error diagnostics: The date you
specified is too far in advance.; or Please be aware that the return
date must be later than the departure date.; or No records satisfy
your request.; or There don?t seem to be any flights from Boston.
The speech-act inventory also includes two types of speech acts
whose function is to confirm information that has already been pro-
vided by the caller. In order to identify and confirm the parameters
of the trip, systems may ask the caller direct questions, as in SYS3
and SYS4 in Figure 2. These EXPLICIT-CONFIRM speech acts are
sometimes triggered by the system?s belief that a misunderstand-
ing may have occurred. A typical example is Are you traveling
to Dallas?. An alternative form of the same EXPLICIT-CONFIRM
speech-act type asserts the information the system has understood
and asks for confirmation in an immediately following question: I
have you arriving in Dallas. Is that correct? In both cases, the
caller is intended to provide a response.
A less intrusive form of confirmation, which we tag as IMPLICIT-
CONFIRM, typically presents the user with the system?s understand-
ing of one travel parameter immediately before asking about the
next parameter. Depending on the site, implicit information can ei-
ther precede the new request for information, as in Flying to Tokyo.
What day are you leaving?, or can occur within the same utter-
ance, as in What day do you want to leave London? More rarely,
an implicit confirmation is followed by PRESENT-INFO: a flight
on Monday September 25. Delta has a flight departing Atlanta at
nine thirty. One question about the use of implicit confirmation
strategy is whether the caller realizes they can correct the system
when necessary [10]. Although IMPLICIT-CONFIRMS typically oc-
cur as part of a successful sequence of extracting trip information
from the caller, they can also occur in situations where the system
is having trouble understanding the caller. In this case, the system
may attempt to instruct the user on what it is doing to remediate
the problem in between an IMPLICIT-CONFIRM and a REQUEST-
INFO: So far, I have you going from Tokyo. I am trying to assemble
enough information to pick a flight. Right now I need you to tell me
your destination.
We have observed that INSTRUCTIONS are a speech-act type
that distinguishes these human-computer travel planning dialogues
from corresponding human-human travel planning dialogues. In-
structions sometimes take the form of a statement or an imperative,
and are characterized by their functional goal of clarifying the sys-
tem?s own actions, correcting the user?s expectations, or changing
the user?s future manner of interacting with the system. Dialogue
systems are less able to diagnose a communication problem than
human travel agents, and callers are less familiar with the capa-
bilities of such systems. As noted above, some systems resort to
explicit instructions about what the system is doing or is able to do,
or about what the user should try in order to assist the system: Try
asking for flights between two major cities; or You can cancel the
San Antonio, Texas, to Tampa, Florida flight request or change it.
To change it, you can simply give new information such as a new
departure time. Note that INSTRUCTIONS, unlike the preceding di-
alogue act types, do not directly involve a domain task.
Like the INSTRUCTION speech-acts, APOLOGIES do not address
a domain task. They typically occur when the system encoun-
ters problems, for example, in understanding the caller (I?m sorry,
I?m having trouble understanding you), in accessing the database
(Something is wrong with the flight retrieval), or with the connec-
tion (Sorry, we seem to have a bad connection. Can you please call
me back later?).
The OPENING/CLOSING speech act category characterizes utter-
ances that open and close the dialogue, such as greetings or good-
byes [26]. Most of the dialogue systems open the interactions with
some sort of greeting?Hello, welcome to our Communicator flight
travel system, and end with a sign-off or salutation?Thank you
very much for calling. This session is now over. We distinguish
these utterances from other dialogue acts, but we do not tag open-
ings separate from closings because they have a similar function,
and can be distinguished by their position in the discourse. We also
include in this category utterances in which the systems survey the
caller as to whether s/he got the information s/he needed or was
happy with the system.
4. THE TASK-SUBTASK DIMENSION
The TASK-SUBTASK dimension refers to a task model of the do-
main task that the system is designed to support and captures dis-
tinctions among dialogue acts that reflect the task structure.1 Our
domain is air travel reservations, thus the main communicative task
is to specify information pertaining to an air travel reservation, such
as the destination city. Once a flight has been booked, ancillary
tasks such as arranging for lodging or a rental car become relevant.
The fundamental motivation for the TASK-SUBTASK dimension in
the DATE scheme is to derive metrics related to subtasks in order to
quantify how much effort a system expends on particular subtasks.2
This dimension distinguishes among 13 subtasks, some of which
can also be grouped at a level below the top level task. The subtasks
and examples are in Figure 5. The TOP-LEVEL-TRIP task describes
the task which contains as its subtasks the ORIGIN, DESTINATION,
DATE, TIME, AIRLINE, TRIP-TYPE, RETRIEVAL and ITINERARY
tasks. The GROUND task includes both the HOTEL and CAR sub-
tasks.
Typically each COMMUNICATOR dialogue system acts as though
it utilizes a task model, in that it has a particular sequence in which
it will ask for task information if the user doesn?t take the initia-
tive to volunteer this information. For example, most systems ask
first for the origin and destination cities, then for the date and time.
Some systems ask about airline preference and others leave it to the
caller to volunteer this information. A typical sequence of tasks for
the flight planning portion of the dialogue is illustrated in Figure 6.
As Figure 6 illustrates, any subtask can involve multiple speech
acts. For example, the DATE subtask can consist of acts requesting,
or implicitly or explicitly confirming the date. A similar exam-
ple is provided by the subtasks of CAR (rental) and HOTEL, which
include dialogue acts requesting, confirming or acknowledging ar-
rangements to rent a car or book a hotel room on the same trip.
1This dimension is used as an elaboration of each speech-act type
in other tagging schemes [24].
2It is tempting to also consider this dimension as a means of in-
ferring discourse structure on the basis of utterance level labels,
since it is widely believed that models of task structure drive the
behavior of dialogue systems [23, 3, 22], and the relationship be-
tween discourse structure and task structure has been a core topic
of research since Grosz?s thesis [15]. However, we leave the infer-
ence of discourse structure as a topic for future work because the
multifunctionality of many utterances suggests that the correspon-
dence between task structure and dialogue structure may not be as
straightforward as has been proposed in Grosz?s work [30].

Figure 6: Dialogue Illustrating a Typical Task Sequence
There are also differences in how each site?s dialogue strategy
reflects it conceptualization of the travel planning task. For exam-
ple, some systems ask the user explicitly for their airline prefer-
ences whereas others do not (the systems illustrated in Figures 1
and 6 do not, wherase the one in Figure 2 does). Another differ-
ence is whether the system asks the user explicitly whether s/he
wants a round-trip ticket. Some systems ask this information early
on, and search for both the outbound and the return flights at the
same time. Other systems do not separately model round-trip and
multi-leg trips. Instead they ask the user for information leg by leg,
and after requesting the user to select an itinerary for one leg of
the flight, they ask whether the user has an additional destination.
A final difference was that, in the June 2000 data collection, some
systems such as the one illustrated in Figure 1 included the ground
arrangements subtasks, and others did not.
5. IMPLEMENTATION
Our focus in this work is in labelling the system side of the di-
alogue; our goal was to develop a fully automatic 100% correct
dialogue parser for the limited range of utterances produced by the
9 COMMUNICATOR systems. While we believe that it would be
useful to be able to assign dialogue acts to both sides of the con-
versation, we expect that to require hand-labelling [1]. We also
believe that in many cases the system behaviors are highly corre-
lated with the user behaviors of interest; for example when a user
has to repeat himself because of a misunderstanding, the system
has probably prompted the user multiple times for the same item of
information and has probably apologized for doing so. Thus this
aspect of the dialogue would also be likely to be captured by the
APOLOGY dialogue act and by counts of effort expended on the
particular subtask.
We implemented a pattern matcher that labels the system side
of each dialogue. An utterance or utterance sequence is identifed
automatically from a database of patterns that correspond to the di-
alogue act classification we arrived at in cooperation with the site
developers. Where it simplifies the structure of the dialogue parser,
we assign two adjacent utterances that are directed at the same goal
the same DATE label, thus ignoring the utterance level segmenta-
tion, but we count the number of characters used in each act. Since
some utterances are generated via recursive or iterative routines,
some patterns involve wildcards.
The current implementation labels the utterances with tags that
are independent of any particular markup-language or representa-
tion format. We have written a transducer that takes the labelled
dialogues and produces HTML output for the purpose of visual-
izing the distribution of dialogue acts and meta-categories in the
dialogues. An additional summarizer program is used to produce a
summary of the percentages and counts of each dialogue act as well
as counts of meta-level groupings of the acts related to the different
dimensions of the tagging scheme. We intend to use our current
representation to generate ATLAS compliant representations [4].
6. RESULTS
Our primary goal was to achieve a better understanding of the
qualitative aspects of each system?s dialogue behavior. We can
quantify the extent to which the dialogue act metrics have the po-
tential to improve our understanding by applying the PARADISE
framework to develop a model of user satisfaction and then exam-
ining the extent to which the dialogue act metrics improve these
models [31]. In other work, we show that given the standard met-
rics collected for the COMMUNICATOR dialogue systems, the best
model accounts for 38% of the variance in user satisfaction [28].
When we retrain these models with the dialogue act metrics ex-
tracted by our dialogue parser, we find that many metrics are signif-
icant predictors of user satisfaction, and that the model fit increases
from 38% to 45%. When we examine which dialogue metrics are
significant, we find that they include several types of meta-dialogue
such as explicit and implicit confirmations of what the user said,
and acknowledgments that the system is going to go ahead and do
the action that the user has requested. Significant negative predic-
tors include apologies. On interpretation of many of the significant
predictors is that they are landmarks in the dialogue for achieve-
ment of particular subtasks. However the predictors based on the
core metrics included a ternary task completion metric that captures
succinctly whether any task was achieved or not, and whether the
exact task that the user was attempting to accomplish was achieved.
A plausible explanation for the increase in the model fits is that user
satisfaction is sensitive to exactly how far through the task the user
got, even when the user did not in fact complete the task. The
role of the other significant dialogue metrics are plausibly inter-
preted as acts important for error minimization. As with the task-
related dialogue metrics, there were already metrics related to ASR
performance in the core set of metrics. However, several of the
important metrics count explicit confirmations, one of the desired
date of travel, and the other of all information before searching the
database, as in utterances SYS3 and SYS4 in Figure 2.
7. DISCUSSION
This paper has presented DATE, a dialogue act tagging scheme
developed explicitly for the purpose of comparing and evaluating
spoken dialogue systems. We have argued that such a scheme needs
to make three important distinctions in system dialogue behaviors
and we are investigating the degree to which any given type of dia-
logue act belongs in a single category or in multiple categories.
We also propose the view that a tagging scheme be viewed as a
partial model of a natural class of dialogues. It is a model to the de-
gree that it represents claims about what features of the dialogue are
important and are sufficiently well understood to be operationally
defined. It is partial in that the distributions of the features and
their relationship to one another, i.e., their possible manifestations
in dialogues within the class, are an empirical question.
The view that a dialogue tagging scheme is a partial model of a
class of dialogues implies that a pre-existing tagging scheme can be
re-used on a different research project, or by different researchers,
only to the degree that it models the same natural class with respect
to similar research questions, is sufficient for expressing observa-
tions about what actually occurs within the current dialogues of
interest, and is sufficiently well-defined that high reliability within
and across research sites can be achieved. Thus, our need to modify
existing schemes was motivated precisely to the degree that exist-
ing schemes fall short of these requirements. Other researchers who
began with the goal of re-utilizing existing tagging schemes have
also found it necessary to modify these schemes for their research
purposes [11, 18, 7].
The most substantial difference between our dialogue act tag-
ging scheme and others that have been proposed is in our expan-
sion of the two-way distinction between dialogue tout simple vs.
meta-dialogue, into a three-way distinction among the immediate
dialogue goals, meta-dialogue utterances, and meta-situation utter-
ances. Depending on further investigation, we might decide these
three dimensions have equal status within the overall tagging scheme
(or within the overall dialogue-modeling enterprise), or that there
are two types of meta-dialogue: utterances devoted to maintaining
the channel, versus utterances devoted to establishing/maintaining
the frame. Further, in accord with our view that a tagging scheme
is a partial model, and that it is therefore necessarily evolving as
our understanding of dialogue evolves, we also believe that our for-
mulation of any one dimension, such as the speech-act dimension,
will necessarily differ from other schemes that model a speech-act
dimension.
Furthermore, because human-computer dialogue is at an early
stage of development, any such tagging scheme must be a moving
target, i.e., the more progress is made, the more likely it is we may
need to modify along the way the exact features used in an annota-
tion scheme to characterize what is going on. In particular, as sys-
tem capabilities become more advanced in the travel domain, it will
probably be necessary to elaborate the task model to capture differ-
ent aspects of the system?s problem solving activities. For example,
our task model does not currently distinguish between different as-
pects of information about an itinerary, e.g. between presentation
of price information and presentation of schedule information.
We also expect that some domain-independent modifications are
likely to be necessary as dialogue systems become more success-
ful, for example to address the dimension of ?face?, i.e. the posi-
tive politeness that a system shows to the user [5]. As an example,
consider the difference between the interpretation of the utterance,
There are no flights from Boston to Boston, when produced by a
system vs. when produced by a human travel agent. If a human
said this, it would be be interpretable by the recipient as an in-
sult to their intelligence. However when produced by a system, it
functions to identify the source of the misunderstanding. Another
distinction that we don?t currently make which might be useful is
between the initial presentation of an item of information and its
re-presentation in a summary. Summaries arguably have a differ-
ent communicative function [29, 7]. Another aspect of function
our representation doesn?t capture is rhetorical relations between
speech acts [20, 21].
While we developed DATE to answer particular research ques-
tions in the COMMUNICATOR dialogues, there are likely to be as-
pects of DATE that can be applied elsewhere. The task dimension
tagset reflects our model of the domain task. The utility of a task
model may be general across domains and for this particular do-
main, the categories we employ are presumably typical of travel
tasks and so, may be relatively portable.
The speech act dimension includes categories typically found in
other classifications of speech acts, such as REQUEST-INFO, OF-
FER, and PRESENT-INFO. We distinguish information presented to
the user about the task, PRESENT-INFO, from information provided
to change the user?s behavior, INSTRUCTION, and from information
presented in explanation or apology for an apparent interruption in
the dialogue, STATUS-REPORT. The latter has some of the flavor
of APOLOGIES, which have an inter-personal function, along with
OPENINGS/CLOSINGS. We group GREETINGS and SIGN-OFFS into
the single category of OPENINGS/CLOSINGS on the assumption that
politeness forms make less contribution to perceived system suc-
cess than the system?s ability to carry out the task, to correct mis-
understandings, and to coach the user.
Our third dimension, conversational-domain, adds a new cate-
gory, ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME, to the more familiar distinction
between utterances directed at a task goal vs. utterances directed
at a maintaining the communication. This distinction supports the
separate classification of utterances directed at managing the user?s
assumptions about how to interact with the system on the air travel
task. As we mention above, the ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME utter-
ances that we find in the human-computer dialogues typically did
not occur in human-human air travel dialogues. In addition, as we
note above, one obvious difference in the dialogue strategies im-
plemented at different sites had to do with whether these utterances
occurred upfront, within the dialogue, or both.
In order to demonstrate the utility of dialogue act tags as metrics
for spoken dialogue systems, we show that the use of these metrics
in the application of PARADISE [31] improves our model of user
satisfaction by an absolute 7%, from 38% to 45%. This is a large
increase, and the fit of these models are very good for models of
human behavior. We believe that we have only begun to discover
the ways in which the output of the dialogue parser can be used. In
future work we will examine whether other representations derived
from the metrics we have applied, such as sequences or structural
relations between various types of acts might improve our perfor-
mance model further. We are also collaborating with other mem-
bers of the COMMUNICATOR community who are investigating the
use of dialogue act and initiative tagging schemes for the purpose
of comparing human-human to human-computer dialogues [1].
