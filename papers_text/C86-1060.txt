1. In t roduct ion  
In natural language processing, one of 
the major problems to be solved i s  how to 
descr ibe l inguist ic  and semant ic  knowledge 
in  the  sye\ ] tem.  I f  we nse  no par t i cu la r  
techn ique  and capture  the  behav ior  in  rea l  
I anguage as  i t i s ,  the  number  o f  FU\ ]es .  
concepts and relat ions to  be arranged may 
expand so  much? But those  th ings  conta in  a l l  
essent ia l  and pr imi t ive  e lements  o f  language 
that we want to find out at \]east. In this 
Paper ,  i t  i s  cons idered  to  ext rac t  p r imi t ive  
e lements  f rom rea l  l ingu is t i c  behav ior ,  and 
app ly  the  e lements  to  ana lys i s  sentence .  As 
the  above-ment ioned  e lements ,  we use  a 
re la t ion  between words .  ( l t  i s  ca l led

2. C luster ing of Words 
2.1 .  C lus ter ing  Method 
The process  o f  the  word  c lass i f i ca t ion  
based  on the  pat tern  o f  re la t ions  i s  done  as  
fo l lows .  F i r s t ,  numbers  o f  sentences  are  
prov ided  and Kakar i -Uke  re la t ions  are  g iven  
to them. We call those sentences text data. 
Next we get the source side and the sink 
s ide  pat tern  o f  re la t ions  fo r  each  word  
appear ing  in the  text  data .  Then we 
ca lcu la te  a d i s tance  between words .  The 
d i s lance  i s de f i  ned as  a cor respondence  
between the  pat terns  themse lves  and the  
f requency  o f  each  re la t ion  mak ing  the  
pat terns .  Words are  c lass i f ied  by a 
c lus ter ing  a lgor i thm us ing  th i s  d i s tance .  
The d is tance  has  two types ;  one  fo r  the  
source  s ide  pat terns  and the  o ther  for '  the  
s ink  s ide  pat terns .  For  each  word ,  two 
c lus ter ing  processes  are  app l ied  cor respond-  
ing to those two types ot  distances. In this 
paper ,  the  dependency  s t r t . l c ture  i s  ca l led  as  
the  knowledge base .  
2 .2 .  Re.sul {s 
We made an exper i  ment  o f  word 
c lus ter ing  on the  4178 sentences  of  text  
data  quoted  f rom computer  manua ls .  In th i s  
exper iment ,  a spec ia l  t reatment  was taken  
fo r  compound words  to  ensure  in fo rmat ion .  
There  are  many compound words  in Japanese  
sentences  wh ich  are  made by combin ing  words  
and act  as  one  word .  They are  ca l led  Fuku9o-  
go in Japanese .  I f  we great  them a l l  as  
d i f fe rent  f rom each  o ther ,  many words  appear  
ra re ly ,  so  that  the  re la t ing  pat . te rns  of  
each  word  cannot  be captured  su f f i c ient ly .  
Because  of  th i s  reason ,  we adop led  a 
mechan ism that  rep laces  compound words  by a 
normal  one  inc lud ing  the  same mean ing  
grammat ica l  ro les  in g rammar  as  the  fo rmer .  
Th is  mechan ism can  work  automat ica l ly  as  a 
par t  o f  the  sys tem.  
As t i le  resu l t  o f  th i s  exper iment ,  i t  
was observed  as  expected  that  semant ica l ly  
re la ted  words  tend  to  be combined ,  t towever ,  
some words  wh ich  have  d i f fe rent  mean ing  are  
combined  w i th  a we l l  c lass i f ied  word group ,  
and severa l  we l l  c lass i f ied  groups  are  
combined .  Not on ly  synonyms,  but  a l so  the  
words  s imi la r  in  some par ts  as the  extens ion  
o f  t i le  words ,  and a l so  the  words  wh ich  have  
a common par t  in  the  upper  concept  tend  to  
be combined .  I t  i s  in teres t ing  that  antonyms 
tend  to  be combined  w i th  each  o ther .  I t  was 
a l so  found that  words  conta ined  in  the  same 
group  be long  to  the  same par t  o f  speech  
a lmost  a lways .

We made ESSAY (Exper imenta l  Sys tem o f

Fig.4 Analysis Results of every Sentence Length 
a) There is a problem that the l ong  
sentence with many Bunsetu often makes too 
many combinat ions of re lat ion cand idates .  
b) There are some cases that no result  is 
obtained because only a part of words does 
not have a re lat ion candidates although all 
of others have the correct relations, 
c) I t  i s  d i f f i cu l t  to  descr ibe  a para l le l

There fore ,  i t  i s  d i f f i cu l t  to  ana lyze  a 
sentence  conta in ing  para l le l  re la t ions .  
d)  The  ra te  a t  wh ich  the  ana lys i s  succeeds  
depends  on  the  length  o f  the  sentence .  As 
the sentence becomes l onger ,  the rate 
becomes lower. The average of the rate was 
about  40 per  cent .  
Th is  resu l t  i s  shown in  F Ig .4 .

There  a re  word~ re la t ing  to  more  than  
two o ther  words  a t  the  same t ime.  As shown 
in  F ig .5 (a ) ,  four  kinds of  re la t ions  appear

The  e lement  Mi i  means  f requency  o f  Ri

re la t ion  becomes  more  re l iab le ,  i t  i s  
expected  to  get  re la t ions  accord ing  to the  
sentence  mean ing .
