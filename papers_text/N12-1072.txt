Abstract
Public debate functions as a forum for both
expressing and forming opinions, an impor-
tant aspect of public life. We present results
for automatically classifying posts in online
debate as to the position, or STANCE that the
speaker takes on an issue, such as Pro or Con.
We show that representing the dialogic struc-
ture of the debates in terms of agreement rela-
tions between speakers, greatly improves per-
formance for stance classification, over mod-
els that operate on post content and parent-
post context alone.
1 Introduction
Public debate functions as a forum for both express-
ing and forming opinions. Three factors affect opin-
ion formation, e.g. the perlocutionary uptake of de-
bate arguments (Cialdini, 2000; Petty and Cacioppo,
1988; Petty et al, 1981). First, there is the ARGU-
MENT itself, i.e. the propositions discussed along
with the logical relations between them. Second is
the SOURCE of the argument (Chaiken, 1980), e.g.
the speaker?s expertise, or agreement relations be-
tween speakers. The third factor consists of proper-
ties of the AUDIENCE such as prior beliefs, social
identity, personality, and cognitive style (Davies,
1998). Perlocutionary uptake in debates primar-
ily occurs in the audience, who may be undecided,
while debaters typically express a particular position
or STANCE on an issue, e.g. Pro or Con, as in the
online debate dialogues in Figs. 1, 2, and 3.
Previous computational work on debate covers
three different debate settings: (1) congressional de-
Post Stance Utterance
P1 PRO I feel badly for your ignorance because although
there maybe a sliver of doubt that mankind may
have evolved from previous animals, there is no
doubt that the Earth and the cosmos have gone
through evolution and are continuing to do so
P2 CON As long as there are people who doubt evolu-
tion, both lay and acedamia, then evolution is in
doubt. And please don?t feel bad for me. I am
perfectly secure in my ?ignorance?.
P3 PRO By that measure, as long as organic chemistry,
physics and gravity are in doubt by both lay and
acedamia, then organic chemistry, physics and
gravity are in doubt. Gravity is a theory. Why
aren?t you giving it the same treatment you do
to evolution? Or is it because you are ignorant?
Angelic Falling anyone?
P4 CON I?m obviously ignorant. Look how many times
i?ve been given the title. ?Gravity is a theory.
Why aren?t you giving it the same treatment you
do to evolution?? Because it doesn?t carry the
same weight. ;P

bates (Thomas et al, 2006; Bansal et al, 2008;
Yessenalina et al, 2010; Balahur et al, 2009; Bur-
foot et al, 2011); (2) company-internal discussion
sites (Murakami and Raymond, 2010; Agrawal et
al., 2003); and (3) online social and political public
forums (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Somasun-
daran and Wiebe, 2010; Wang and Rose?, 2010; Bi-
ran and Rambow, 2011). Debates in online public
forums (e.g. Fig. 1) differ from debates in congress
and on company discussion sites in two ways.
First, the language is different. Online debaters
are highly involved, often using emotional and col-
orful language to make their points. These debates
are also personal, giving a strong sense of the indi-
592
vidual making the argument, and whether s/he fa-
vors emotive or factual modes of expression, e.g.
Let me answer.... NO! (P2 in Fig. 3). Other com-
mon features are sarcasm, e.g. I?m obviously igno-
rant. Look how many times i?ve been given the ti-
tle (P4 in Fig. 1), questioning another?s evidence or
assumptions: Yes there is always room for human
error, but is one accident that hasn?t happened yet
enough cause to get rid of a capital punishment? (P2
in Fig. 3), and insults: Or is it because you are ig-
norant? (P3 in Fig. 1). These properties may func-
tion to engage the audience and persuade them to
form a particular opinion, but they make computa-
tional analysis of such debates challenging, with the
best performance to date averaging 64% over several
topics (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).
Post Stance Utterance
P1 Superman Batman is no match for superman. Not
only does he have SUPERnatural powers as
opposed to batman?s wit and gadgetry, but
his powers have increased in number over
the years. For example, when Superman?s
prowess was first documented in the comics
he did not have x-ray vision. It wasn?t until
his story was told on radio that he could see
through stuff. So no matter what new weapon
batman could obtain, Superman would add an-
other SUPERnatural weapon to foil the Caped
crusader.
P2 Batman Superman GAVE Batman a krytonite ring so
that Batman could take him down should he
need to. Superman did this because he knows
Batman is the only guy that could do it.
P3 Superman But, not being privy to private conversations
with S-man, you wouldn?t know that, being the
humble chap that he is, S-man allowed batman
the victory because he likes the bat and wanted
him to mantain some credibility. Honest.
P4 Batman Hmmm, this is confusing. Since we all know
that Supes doesn?t lie and yet at the time of
him being beaten by Batman he was under the
control of Poison Ivy and therefore could NOT
have LET Batman win on purpose. I have to
say that I am beginning to doubt you really are
friends with Supes at all.

was ?Superman vs. Batman?
Second, the affordances of different online debate
sites provide differential support for dialogic rela-
tions between forum participants. For example, the
research of Somasundaran and Wiebe (2010), does
not explicitly model dialogue or author relations.
However debates in our corpus vary greatly by topic
on two dialogic factors: (1) the percent of posts that
are rebuttals to prior posts, and (2) the number of
Post Stance Utterance
P1 CON 69 people have been released from death row
since 1973 these people could have been killed
if there cases and evidence did not come up rong
also these people can have lost 20 years or more
to a false coviction. it is only a matter of time till
some one is killed yes u could say there doing
a good job now but it has been shown so many
times with humans that they will make the hu-
man error and cost an innocent person there life.
P2 PRO Yes there is always room for human error, but
is one accident that hasn?t happened yet enough
cause to get rid of a capital punishment? Let me
answer...NO! If you ban the death penalty crime
will skyrocket. It is an effective deterannce for
crime. The states that have strict death penalty
laws have less crime than states that don?t (Texas
vs. Michigan) Texas?s crime rate is lower than
Michigan and Texas has a higher population!!!!

?Capital Punishment?, and the argument was framed as
?Yes we should keep it? vs. ?No we should not?.
posts per author. The first 5 columns of Table 2
shows the variation in these dimensions by topic.
In this paper we show that information about di-
alogic relations between authors (SOURCE factors)
improves performance for STANCE classification,
when compared to models that only have access to
properties of the ARGUMENT. We model SOURCE
relations with a graph, and add this information to
classifiers operating on the text of a post. Sec. 2
describes the corpus and our approach. Our cor-
pus is publicly available, see (Walker et al, 2012).
We show in Sec. 3 that modeling source properties
improves performance when the debates are highly
dialogic. We leave a more detailed comparison to
previous work to Sec. 3 so that we can contrast pre-
vious work with our approach.
2 Experimental Method and Approach
Our corpus consists of two-sided debates from Con-
vinceme.net for 14 topics that range from play-
ful debates such as Superman vs. Batman (Fig. 2
to more heated political topics such as the Death
Penalty (Fig. 3. In total the corpus consists of 2902
two-sided debates (36,307 posts), totaling 3,080,874
words; the topic labelled debates which we use in
our experiments contain 575,818 words. On Con-
vinceme, a person starts a debate by posting a topic
or a question and providing sides such as for vs.
against. Debate participants can then post argu-
ments for one side or the other, essentially self-
593
labelling their post for stance. Convinceme pro-
vides three possible sources of dialogic structure,
SIDE, REBUTTAL LINKS and TEMPORAL CONTEXT.
Timestamps for posts are only available by day and
there are no agreement links. Here, we use the self-
labelled SIDE as the stance to be predicted.
Set/Factor Description
Basic Number of Characters in post, Average Word
Length, Unigrams, Bigrams
Sentiment LIWC counts and frequencies, Opinion De-
pendencies, LIWC Dependencies, negation
Argument Cue Words, Repeated Punctuation, Context,
POS-Generalized Dependencies, Quotes
Table 1: Feature Sets
We construct features from the posts, along with a
representation of the parent post as context, and use
those features in several base classifiers. As shown
in Table 1, we distinguish between basic features,
such as length of the post and the words and bi-
grams in the post, and features capturing sentiment
and subjectivity, including using the LIWC tool for
emotion labelling (Pennebaker et al, 2001) and de-
riving generalized dependency features using LIWC
categories, as well as some limited aspects of the
argument structure, such as cue words signalling
rhetorical relations between posts, POS generalized
dependencies, and a representation of the parent post
(context). Only rebuttal posts have a parent post, and
thus values for the context features.
50-10
Figure 4: Sample maxcut to ConvinceMe siding. Sym-
bols (circle, cross, square, triangles) indicate authors and
fill colors (white,black) indicate true side. Rebuttal links
are marked by black edges, same-author links by red;
weights are 50 and -10, respectively. Edges in the max-
cut are highlighted in yellow, and the nodes in each cut
set are bounded by the green dotted line.
We then construct a graph (V,E) representing the
dialogue structure, using the rebuttal links and au-
thor identifiers from the forums site. Each node V
of the graph is a post, and edges E indicate dialogic
relations of agreement and disagreement between
posts. We assume only that authors always agree
with themselves, and that rebuttal links indicate dis-
agreement. Agreement links based on the inference
that if A, B disagree with C they agree with each
other were not added to the graph.
Maxcut attempts to partition a graph into two
sides. Fig. 4 illustrates a sample result of applying
MaxCut. Edges connecting the partitions are said
to be cut, while those within partitions are not. The
goal is to maximize the sum of cut edge weights. By
making edge weights high we reward the algorithm
for cutting the edge, by making edge weights nega-
tive we penalize the algorithm for cutting the edge.
Rebuttal links were assigned a weight +100/(num-
ber of rebuttals). Same author links were assigned a
weight -60/(number of posts by author). If author A
rebutted author B at some point, then a weight of 50
was assigned to all edges connecting posts by author
A and posts by author B. If author B rebutted author
A as well, that 50 was increased to 100. We applied
the MaxCut partitioning algorithm to this graph, and
then we orient each of the components automati-
cally using a traditional supervised classifier. We
consider each component separately where compo-
nents are defined using the original (pre-MaxCut)
graph. For each pair of partition side p ? {P0, P1}
and classifier label l ? {L0, L1}, we compute a
score Sp,l by summing the margins of all nodes as-
signed to that partition and label. We then compute
and compare the score differences for each partition.
Dp = Sp,L1 ? Sp,L0 If DP0 < DP1 , then nodes in
partition P0 should be assigned label L0 and nodes
in P1 should be assigned label L1. Likewise, if
DP0 > DP1 , then nodes in partition P0 should be as-
signed label L1 and nodes in P1 should be assigned
label L0. If DP0 = DP1 , then we orient the compo-
nent with a coin flip.

tures with ?2 feature selection; we use JRIP as the
base classifier because margins are used by the auto-
matic MaxCut graph orientation algorithm. Exper-
iments with different learners (NB, SVM) did not
yield significant differences from JRIP. The results
show that, in general, representing dialogic infor-
mation in terms of a network of relations between
posts yields very large improvements. In the few
topics where performance is worse (Death Penalty,
Gun Control, Mac vs. PC, Superman vs. Batman),
the MaxCut graph gets oriented to the stance sides
the wrong way, so that the cut actually groups the
posts correctly into sides, but then assigns them to
the wrong side. For Maxcut, as expected, there are
significant correlations between the % of Rebuttals
in a debate and Precision (R = .16 ) and Recall (R=
.22), as well as between Posts/Author and Precision
(R = .25) and Recall (R = .43). This clearly indi-
cates that the degree of dialogic behavior (the graph
topology) has a strong influence on results per topic.
These results would be even stronger if all MaxCut
graphs were oriented correctly.
(Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010) present an un-
supervised approach using ICA to stance classifica-
tion, showing that identifying argumentation struc-
ture improves performance, with a best performance
averaging 64% accuracy over all topics, but as high
as 70% for some topics. Other research classifies
the speaker?s side in a corpus of congressional floor
debates (Thomas et al, 2006; Bansal et al, 2008;
Balahur et al, 2009; Burfoot et al, 2011). Thomas
et al(2006) achieved accuracies of 71.3% by using
speaker agreement information in the graph-based
MinCut/Maxflow algorithm, as compared to accura-
cies around 70% via an an SVM classifier operating
on content alone. The best performance to date on
this corpus achieves accuracies around 82% for dif-
ferent graph-based approaches as compared to 76%
accuracy for content only classification (Burfoot et
al., 2011). Other work applies MaxCut to the reply
structure of company discussion forums, showing
that rules for identifying agreement (Murakami and
Raymond, 2010), defined on the textual content of
the post yield performance improvements over using
reply structures alone (Malouf and Mullen, 2008;
Agrawal et al, 2003)
Our results are not strictly comparable since we
use a different corpus with different properties, but
to our knowledge this is the first application of Max-
Cut to stance classification that shows large perfor-
mance improvements from modeling dialogic rela-
tions. In future work, we plan to explore whether
deeper linguistic features can yield large improve-
ments in both the base classifier and in MaxCut re-
sults, and to explore better ways of automatically
orienting the MaxCut graph to stance side. We also
hope to develop much better context features and to
make even more use of dialogue structure.
