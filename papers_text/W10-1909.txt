Abstract 
Here we explore mining data on gene expres-
sion from the biomedical literature and 
present Gene Expression Text Miner 
(GETM), a tool for extraction of information 
about the expression of genes and their ana-
tomical locations from text. Provided with 
recognized gene mentions, GETM identifies 
mentions of anatomical locations and cell 
lines, and extracts text passages where au-
thors discuss the expression of a particular 
gene in specific anatomical locations or cell 
lines. This enables the automatic construction 
of expression profiles for both genes and ana-
tomical locations. Evaluated against a ma-
nually extended version of the BioNLP '09 
corpus, GETM achieved precision and recall 
levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Ap-
plication of GETM to MEDLINE and 
PubMed Central yielded over 700,000 gene 
expression mentions. This data set may be 
queried through a web interface, and should 
prove useful not only for researchers who are 
interested in the developmental regulation of 
specific genes of interest, but also for data-
base curators aiming to create structured re-
positories of gene expression information. 
The compiled tool, its source code, the ma-
nually annotated evaluation corpus and a 
search query interface to the data set ex-
tracted from MEDLINE and  PubMed Cen-
tral is available at http://getm-
project.sourceforge.net/. 
1 Introduction 
With almost 2000 articles being published daily 
in 2009, the amount of available research litera-
ture in the biomedical domain is increasing ra-
pidly. Currently, MEDLINE contains reference 
records for almost 20 million articles (with about 
10 million abstracts), and PubMed Central 
(PMC) contains almost two million full-text ar-
ticles. These resources store an enormous wealth 
of information, but are proving increasingly dif-
ficult to navigate and interpret. This is true both 
for researchers seeking information on a particu-
lar subject and for database curators aiming to 
collect and annotate information in a structured 
manner. 
Text-mining tools aim to alleviate this prob-
lem by extracting structured information from 
unstructured text. Considerable attention has 
been given to some areas in text-mining, such as 
recognizing named entities (e.g. species, genes 
and drugs) (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al, 2007; 
Hakenberg et al, 2008; Gerner et al, 2010) and 
extracting molecular relationships, e.g. protein-
protein interactions (Donaldson et al, 2003; 
Plake et al, 2006; Chowdhary et al, 2009). 
Many other areas of text mining in the biomedi-
cal domain are less mature, including the extrac-
tion of information about the expression of genes 
(Kim et al, 2009). The literature contains a large 
amount of information about where and when 
genes are expressed, as knowledge about the ex-
pression of a gene is critical for understanding its 
function and has therefore often been reported as 
part of gene studies. Gene expression profiles 
from genome-wide studies are available in spe-
cialized databases such as the NCBI Gene Ex-
pression Omnibus (Barrett et al, 2009) and 
FlyAtlas (Chintapalli et al, 2007), but results on 
gene expression from smaller studies remain 
locked in the primary literature. 
Previously, a number of data-mining projects 
have combined text-mining methods with struc-
tured genome-wide gene expression data in order 
72
  
to allow further interpretation of the gene expres-
sion data (Natarajan et al, 2006; Fundel, 2007). 
However, only recently has interest in text-
mining tools aimed at extracting gene expression 
profiles from primary literature started to grow. 
The 2009 BioNLP shared task (Kim et al, 2009) 
aimed at extracting biological "events", where 
one of the event types was gene expression. For 
this event type, participants were asked to deter-
mine locations in text documents where authors 
discussed the expression of a gene or protein and 
extract a trigger keyword (e.g. "expression") and 
its associated gene participant (the gene whose 
expression is discussed). The group that achieved 
the highest accuracy on the "simple event" task 
(where gene expression extraction was included) 
achieved recall and precision levels of 64.2% and 
77.5%, respectively (Bj?rne et al, 2009). A key 
limitation of the 2009 shared task was that all 
genes had been annotated prior to the beginning 
of the task, making it difficult to anticipate the 
accuracy of tools that do not rely on pre-
annotated entities. 
Biologists are interested not only in finding 
statements of gene expression events, but also in 
knowing where and when a gene is expressed. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, no effort 
has previously been made to extract and map the 
expression of genes to specific tissues and cell 
types (and vice versa) from the literature. Thus, 
we have taken preliminary steps to construct a 
software tool, named Gene Expression Text 
Miner (GETM), capable of extracting informa-
tion about what genes are expressed and where 
they are expressed. An additional goal of this 
work is to apply this tool to the whole of MED-
LINE and PMC, and make both the tool and the 
extracted data available to researchers.  
We anticipate that the data extracted by 
GETM will provide researchers an overview 
about where a specific gene is expressed, or what 
genes are expressed in a specific anatomical lo-
cation. Moreover, GETM will aid in the curation 
of gene expression databases by providing text 
passages and identifiers to database curators for 
verification.  
2 Methods 
An overview of the workflow of GETM is given 
in Figure 1. Articles are initially scanned for 
mentions of gene entities, anatomical entities and 
keywords indicating the discussion of gene ex-
pression (called triggers following BioNLP ter-
minology, e.g. "expression" and "expressed in"). 
After the detection of the entities and triggers, 
abbreviations are detected and entities are 
grouped in the cases of enumerations. Finally, 
sentences are split and each sentence is 
processed in order to associate triggers with gene 
and anatomical entities. Each step is described 
below in more detail. 
2.1 Named entity recognition and abbrevia-
tion detection 
In order to extract information on the expression 
of genes and their anatomical locations, a key 
requirement is the accurate recognition and nor-
malization (mapping the recognized terms to da-
tabase identifiers) of both the genes and anatom-
ical locations in question. In order to locate and 
identify gene names, we utilized GNAT (Haken-
berg et al, 2008), an inter-species gene name 
recognition software package. Among the gene 
name recognition tools capable of gene normali-
zation, GNAT is currently showing the best ac-
curacy (compared to the BioCreative corpora 
(Hirschman et al, 2005; Morgan et al, 2008)). 
The species identification component of GNAT, 
used to help disambiguate gene mentions across 
species, was performed by LINNAEUS (Gerner 
et al, 2010). 
In order to perform named entity recognition 
(NER) of anatomical locations, we investigated 
the use of various anatomical ontologies. A key 
challenge with these ontologies is that the terms

vary significantly from one species to another. 
For example, fruit flies have wings while humans 
do not, and humans have fingers, while fruit flies 
do not. Efforts have been made in creating uni-
fied species-independent anatomical ontologies, 
such as Uberon (Haendel et al, 2009; Mungall et 
al., 2010). However, in preliminary experiments 
we found that the coverage of Uberon was not 
extensive enough for this particular application 
(data not shown), motivating us to instead use a 
combination of various species-specific anatomi-
cal ontologies hosted at the OBO Foundry 
(Smith et al, 2007). These ontologies (n = 13) 
were chosen in order to cover terms from the 
main model organisms that are used in research 
(e.g. human, fruit fly, mouse, Caenorhabditis 
elegans) and a few larger groups of organisms 
such as e.g. amphibians and fungi. It is worth 
noting that the more general terms, such as e.g. 
"brain", are likely to match anatomical locations 
in other species as well. In total, the selected on-
tologies contain terms for 38,459 different ana-
tomical locations. 
 We also utilized an ontology of cell lines 
(Romano et al, 2009), containing terms for a 
total of 8,408 cell lines (ranging across 60 spe-
cies), as cell lines can be viewed as biological 
proxies for the anatomical locations that gave 
rise to them. For example, the HeLa cell line was 
derived from human cervical cells, and the THP1 
cell line was derived from human monocytes 
(Romano et al, 2009). 
The anatomical and cell line NER, utilizing 
the OBO Foundry and cell line ontologies, was 
performed using dictionary-matching methods 
similar to those employed by LINNAEUS 
(Gerner et al, 2010). 
 After performing gene and anatomical NER 
on the document, abbreviations were detected 
(using the algorithm by Schwartz and Hearst 
(2003)) in order to allow the detection and mar-
kup of abbreviated entity names in the cases 
where the abbreviations do not exist in any of the 
ontologies that are used. 
2.2 Trigger detection 
The trigger keywords indicating that an author is 
discussing the expression of one or several 
genes, such as e.g. "expression" and "expressed 
in" were detected using a manually created list of 
regular expressions. The regular expressions 
were designed to match variations of a set of 
terms, listed below, that were identified when 
inspecting documents not used when building the 
gold-standard corpus (see Section 3.1). 
The terms used to construct the trigger regular 
expressions were orthographical, morphological 
and derivational variations of "expression", "pro-
duction" and "transcription". Descriptions of the 
level of expression were also considered for the 
different terms, such as "over-expression," "un-
der-expression," "positively expressed," "nega-
tively expressed," etc. 
Each gene expression mention that has been 
extracted by GETM contains information about 
the trigger term used by the author, allowing re-
searchers to look only at e.g. the "negative" men-
tions (where genes are e.g. "under-expressed" or 
"negatively expressed") or the "positive" men-
tions (where genes are e.g. "over-expressed"). 
2.3 Association of entities to the trigger 
To help associate triggers with the correct gene 
and anatomical entities, articles were first split 
into sentences, allowing each sentence to be 
processed in turn. In order to reduce the number 
of false positives and preserve a high level of 
precision, any sentences that did not contain a 
trigger, at least one gene mention and at least one 
anatomical mention were ignored. For the sen-
tences that did contain a combination of all three 
requirements (trigger, gene and anatomical men-
tion), the following pattern- and distance-based 
rules were employed in order to associate each 
trigger with the correct gene and anatomical 
mention: 
1. If there is only one gene mention and only 
one anatomical mention in the sentence, the 
trigger is associated with those mentions. 
2. If there is one gene mention (G) and one 
anatomical mention (A) in the sentence 
such that they match one of the patterns 
"<G> is expressed in <A>", "expression of 
<G> in <A>", "<A> transcribes <G>" or 
"<A> produces <G>", the gene mention 
<G> and anatomical mention <A> are asso-
ciated with the trigger (variations of the 
triggers, such as "over-expressed" and 
"negative expression" are considered as 
well). Additional gene or anatomical men-
tions that fall outside the pattern are ig-
nored. 
3. If neither of the above rules applies, the 
trigger is associated with the gene and ana-
tomical mentions that are closest to the trig-
ger. 
For the purposes of these rules, an enumera-
tion of several genes or anatomical locations was 
74
  
handled as if it was only a single mention. For 
example, Rule 1 might trigger even if there are 
several genes mentioned in the same sentence, as 
long as they are mentioned together as part of an 
enumeration. 
In order to detect these enumerations, a rule-
based algorithm for connecting enumerated gene 
and anatomical entity mentions (as in e.g. "... 
RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression ...") was also 
implemented. Being able to detect enumerations 
allowed the rules described above to recognize 
that a particular gene expression mention do not 
refer to only e.g. "RelB" or "DC-CK1", but both 
of them at the same time. 
Each trigger was processed independently, al-
lowing the potential extraction of multiple gene 
expression statements from a single sentence. 
Initially, experiments were performed using 
stricter rules where only variations of Rule 2, 
requiring gene and anatomical mentions to con-
form to certain patterns, were used. However, 
recall was in these cases found to be extremely 
low (below 5%, data not shown). The current 
rules are more permissive, allowing higher recall. 
 The fact that the method requires a combina-
tion of a trigger, a gene and an anatomical loca-
tion makes it susceptible to false negatives: if 
any one of them cannot be found by the NER or 
trigger detection methods, the whole combina-
tion is missed. 
3 Evaluation 
3.1 Extending the BioNLP shared task 
gold-standard corpus 
In order to make a meaningful evaluation of the 
accuracy of text-mining applications, a gold-
standard corpus, consisting of manually anno-
tated mentions for a set of documents, is re-
quired. Previously, no such corpus existed that 
was suitable for this problem (providing annota-
tions linked to mentions of both gene and ana-
tomical locations). However, the BioNLP corpus 
(Ohta et al, 2009) which is based on the GENIA 
corpus (Kim et al, 2008), does contain annota-
tions about gene expression. Annotations in the 
corpus contain trigger terms that are linked to 
genes (or gene products) where the authors dis-
cuss gene expression. However, anatomical loca-
tions have not been annotated in this corpus.  
In order to allow evaluation of the accuracy of 
our software, we extended the annotations of 
gene expression events in part of the BioNLP 
corpus. Each gene expression entry in the corpus 
was linked to the anatomical location or cell line 
that the author mentioned. In cases where gene 
expression was only discussed generally without 
referring to expression in a particular location, no 
association to an anatomical location could be 
made (these entries were ignored during evalua-
tion). Note that named entities were only linked 
to their locations in the text, not to unique data-
base identifiers (such as Entrez Gene or OBO 
Foundry identifiers). Because of this, subsequent 
evaluation in this extended corpus is limited to 
the accuracy of recognition (locating the entities 
in the text), but not normalization (linking the 
entities to database identifiers). 
In total, annotations for 150 abstracts (consti-
tuting the development set of the BioNLP cor-
pus) were extended to also include anatomical 
locations. These abstracts contained 377 anno-
tated gene expression events, of which 267 
(71%) could be linked to anatomical locations. 
These results demonstrate that the majority of 
gene expression mentions include reference to an 
anatomical location. For a few cases where the 
author described the expression of a gene in sev-
eral cell types, a single gene expression event 
gave rise to several distinct "entries" in the ex-
tended corpus, creating a total of 279 final gene 
expression entries that are linked to anatomical 
locations. 
4 Results 
In order to evaluate the accuracy of GETM, it 
was first run on the 150 abstracts in the gold-
standard corpus, after which the extracted results 
were compared against the annotations of the 
corpus. GETM was also applied to the whole of 
MEDLINE and PMC, in order to extract a sear-
chable and structured data set of gene expression 
mentions in published biomedical articles. 
4.1 Accuracy 
The gene expression mentions extracted by 
GETM from the corpus were compared against 
the manually created annotations in order to es-
timate the accuracy of the software. After in-
specting the false positives and false negatives, 
we noted that a number of the false positives ac-
tually were correctly identified by our system 
and had been marked as false positives only be-
cause of incomplete annotations in the corpus. 
Because of this, all false positives were manually 
examined in order to determine the "correct" 
number of false positives. For one of the cor-
rected expression mentions, two anatomical loca-
tions were enumerated, with GETM only locat-
75
  
ing one of them. This introduced both a new true 
positive (for the one that was recognized) and a 
new false negative (for the one that was not). The 
number of true positives, false positives, false 
negatives, precision and recall (before and after 
correction) are shown in Table 1.

positives (FP), false negatives (FN) and levels of

compared against the gold-standard corpus. 
4.2 Analysis of false negatives 
In order to determine the causes of the relatively 
high number of false negatives, the gene entities, 
anatomical entities and triggers identified by 
GNAT and GETM were compared to the ex-
tended corpus, allowing us to determine the 
number of corpus entities that could not be found 
by the GNAT and GETM NER tools. An analy-
sis was also performed in order to determine the 
number of corpus entries that were spread across 
several sentences, as any expression mentions 
spread over several sentences are missed by 
GETM.  
The analysis results can be seen in Table 2, 
showing that virtually all false negatives are 
caused either by incomplete NER or multi-
sentence entries. Only considering the NER, 68% 
of the gold-standard corpus annotated entries 
contain either a trigger (example FN: "detected"), 
gene (example FN: CD4) or anatomical location 
(example FN: "lymphoblastoid cells") that could 
not be located automatically. GETM was further 
limited by entities being spread across several 
sentences (n=66, 23.6%). In total, 74.3% of all 
entries could not be extracted correctly due to 
either incomplete NER, incomplete trigger detec-
tion or the entities being spread across multiple 
sentences. This limited recall to 25.7%, even if 
the rule-based method was working perfectly. 
4.3 Analysis of false positives 
Manual inspection of the false positives (after 
adjusting the false positives caused by incom-
plete annotations) allowed the identification of 
one clear cause: if the NER methods fail to rec-
ognize the entity associated with a manually an-
notated expression entry, but there are other enti-
ties (that have been recognized) in the sentence, 
those entities might be incorrectly associated 
with the trigger instead. For example, in the sen-
tence "In conclusion, these data show that IL-10 
induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by 
activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinas-
es." (Bonig et al, 1996) (the correct entities and 
trigger are italicized), a correctly extracted entry 
would link c-fos to B-cells through the trigger 
expression. However, the gene NER component 
failed to recognize c-fos but did recognize IL-10, 
causing GETM to incorrectly associate IL-10 
with B-cells. Either increasing the accuracy of 
the NER methods or performing deeper gram-
matical parsing could potentially reduce the 
number of false positives of this type. We note  
that the number of cases for this category (n = 
15; 34%) only make up a minority of the total 
number of false positives, and the remainder 
have no easily identifiable common cause. 
4.4 Application to MEDLINE and PMC 
documents 
GETM was applied to the whole set of 
10,240,192 MEDLINE entries from the 2010 
baseline files that contain an abstract (many 
MEDLINE entries do not contain an abstract). 
From these abstracts, 578,319 statements could 
be extracted containing information about the 
expression of a gene and the location of this ex-
pression. In addition, GETM was also applied to 
the set of 186,616 full-text articles that make up 
the open-access portion of PMC (downloaded 
February 5th, 2010). The full-text articles al-
lowed the extraction of 145,796 statements (an 
18-fold increase in entries per article compared 
Problem type Number of occurrences

to the MEDLINE abstracts). In total, 716,541 
statements were extracted, not counting the ab-
stracts in MEDLINE that also appear in PMC. 
Overall, the combined extracted information 
ranges across 25,525 different genes (the most 
common being tumor necrosis factor (TNF su-
perfamily, member 2) in human) and 3,655 dif-
ferent anatomical locations (the most common 
being T cells). The most common combination 
concerns the expression of human interleukin 2 
in T cells. The 10 most commonly mentioned 
combinations of genes and anatomical locations 
are shown in Table 3. Overall, these results sug-
gest that studies on gene expression in the field 
of mammalian immunology are the dominant 
signal in MEDLINE and PMC. The genes that 
were recognized and normalized range across 15 
species, out of the 23 supported by GNAT (Ha-
kenberg et al, 2008). The most common species 
is human, as expected (Gerner et al, 2010), fol-
lowed by mouse, rat, chicken and cow. 
The majority of statements were associated to 
anatomical locations from the OBO Foundry on-
tologies (n=649,819; 89.7%), while the remaind-
er were associated to cell lines (n=74,294; 
10.3%). This result demonstrates the importance 
of taking cell lines into account when attempting 
to identify anatomical entities.  
Finally, a total of 73,721 (11.7%) of the state-
ments extracted from MEDLINE contained ei-
ther genes or anatomical locations that had been 
enumerated by the author, underscoring the im-
portance of considering enumerations when de-
signing text-mining algorithms. 
4.5 Availability 
GETM is available under an open source license, 
and researchers may freely download GETM, its 
source code and the extended gold-standard cor-
pus from http://getm-project.sourceforge.net/. 
Also available on the web site is a search query 
interface where researchers may search for ex-
tracted gene expression entries relating to a par-
ticular gene, anatomical location or a combina-
tion of the two and view these in the context of 
the surrounding text.  
5 Discussion 
5.1 Overview of design philosophy 
When constructing text-mining applications, a 
balance between precision (reflecting the relative 
number of false positives) and recall (reflecting 
the relative number of false negatives) is often 
used to optimize system performance. Accor-
dingly, a measure which often is used to evaluate 
the accuracy of software is the F-score (the har-
monic mean of the precision and recall). In this 
work, we have decided that rather than trying to 
maximize the F-score, we have put more focus 
on precision in order to ensure that the data ex-
tracted by GETM are of as high quality as possi-
ble. This typically leads to lower recall, causing 
the software to detect a relatively smaller number 
of relevant passages. Nonetheless, we believe 
that for this particular application, a smaller 
amount of data with higher quality would be 
more useful to curators and biologists than a 
larger amount of data that is less reliable. 
5.2 Comparison with previous work 
It is difficult to compare the precision and recall 
levels of GETM (at 58.8% and 23.8%, respec-
tively) against other tools, as GETM is the first 
tool aiming to perform this particular task. The 
closest comparison that can be made is against 
the software evaluated in the BioNLP shared task 
(Kim et al, 2009). However, software developed 
for the BioNLP shared task did not attempt to 
extract the anatomical location of gene expres-
sion mentions, nor did they need to identify the 
component entities involved. The tool with the 
highest accuracy for the simple event task (where 
gene expression extraction was included) showed

precision and recall levels of 77.5% and 64.2%, 
respectively (Bj?rne et al, 2009). It is not clear 
how tools evaluated in the 2009 BioNLP shared 
task would perform if they identified entities 
themselves rather than using pre-annotated enti-
ties. 
5.3 Limits on accuracy 
When investigating the cause of the low level of 
recall, the main reason that emerged for the high 
number of false negatives was the high number 
of annotated entries that could not be automati-
cally extracted due to at least one of the gene, 
anatomical or trigger mentions not being recog-
nized. This fact underscores the importance of 
accurate NER for applications that rely on the 
extracted entity mentions, especially those that 
attempt to extract information from multiple enti-
ty types, like GETM. The results also demon-
strate that NER, particularly in the case of gene 
name normalization, continues to pose a chal-
lenging problem. It is possible that using a com-
bination of GNAT and other gene NER tools 
would improve the overall gene NER accuracy. 
We further explored the effects of "perfect" 
gene NER on the accuracy of GETM by using 
the manual gene mention annotations supplied in 
the BioNLP corpus. Using the pre-annotated 
gene names increased the number of gene ex-
pression mentions recognized and the number of 
true positives, significantly improving recall 
(from 23.8% to 37.8%; data not shown). Howev-
er, a number of additional false positives were 
also introduced, causing precision to decrease 
very slightly from 58.8% to 58.5% (data not 
shown). This demonstrates the complexity of 
gene expression mentions in text, indicating that 
a combination of accurate trigger detection, ac-
curate NER (for both genes and anatomical loca-
tions) and deeper NLP methods are needed in 
order to accurately capture gene expression pro-
files in text. 
A secondary cause of false negatives was a 
relatively high number of annotated corpus en-
tries that spanned several sentences. The high 
proportion (23%) of multi-sentence entries in our 
extended corpus differs from previously reported 
results. For the event annotations in the BioNLP 
corpus, previous analyses showed that only 5% 
of all entries spanned several sentences (Bj?rne 
et al, 2009). This suggests that the mentions of 
anatomical locations are located outside of the 
"trigger sentence" more often than gene mentions 
or other entities in the BioNLP corpus. 
6 Conclusions 
In this paper, we have explored integrated min-
ing of gene expression mentions and their ana-
tomical locations from the literature and pre-
sented a new tool, GETM, which can be used to 
extract information about the expression of genes 
and where they are expressed from biomedical 
text. We have also extended part of a previously 
existing gold-standard corpus in order to allow 
evaluation of GETM. When evaluated against 
the gold-standard corpus, GETM performed with 
precision and recall levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, 
respectively.  
The relatively low level of recall was primari-
ly caused by incomplete recognition of individu-
al entities, indicating that ? in order to increase 
the recall of GETM ? future work would primari-
ly need to focus on increasing the accuracy of the 
NER methods. With more accurate NER, while 
increasing recall, the higher number of recog-
nized entities is also expected to increase the 
number of false positives, causing a need for 
deeper NLP methods in order to preserve and 
increase the level of precision. 
While having a low level of recall, GETM was 
nonetheless able to extract 716,541 statements 
from MEDLINE and PMC, constituting a large 
and potentially useful data set for researchers 
wishing to get an overview of gene expression 
for a particular gene or anatomical location. The 
high number of mentions extracted from MED-
LINE can give an indication of the amount of 
data available in MEDLINE: if the recall on the 
BioNLP corpus is representative for MEDLINE 
as a whole, a tool with perfect accuracy might be 
able to extract almost 2.5 million entries. 
The level of precision (p = 58.8%) will most 
likely not be high enough for researchers to rely 
on the extracted data for high-throughput bioin-
formatical experiments without some kind of 
verification. However, we believe that it none-
theless will be of high enough quality that re-
searchers and curators will not feel inconve-
nienced by false positives, as currently the only 
alternatives are multi-word free text searches 
through PubMed or Google. Additionally, we  
provide an interface with the text context sur-
rounding gene expression statements, making it 
easier for researchers to quickly locate relevant 
results. 
In the future, we will aim to evaluate the nor-
malization of entities detected by GETM in order 
to quantify the level to which the identifiers as-
signed to the entities are correct. In addition, 
78
  
both the gene and anatomical NER components 
could be improved in order to both reduce the 
number of false negatives and cover gene and 
anatomical terms for a wider range of species, 
beyond the common model organisms. We also 
believe that extending this work by utilizing dee-
per NLP methods (e.g. dependency parsers) 
could further improve the accuracy of GETM 
and related approaches to mining the abundance 
of data on gene expression in the biomedical lite-
rature.
