I INTRODUCTION 
Decomposition of the problem of "language 
understanding" into manageable subproblems has always 
posed a major  challenge to  the deve lopment  theor ies  of, 
and sys tems fo r ,  natura l - language process ing .  More or  
less  d i s t inc t  components  a re  convent iona l ly  p roposed  fo r  
hand l ing  syntax ,  semant ics ,  p ragmat ics ,  and in ference .  
Whi le  d i sagreement  ex is ts  as  to  what  phenomena proper ly  
be long  in  each  area ,  and how much or  what  k inds  o f  
in teract ion  there  are  among these  components ,  there  i s  
fa i r ly  w idespread  concur rence  as to the overa l l  
o rgan izat ion  of linguistic process ing .  
Central to this approach is the idea that the 
processing of an utterance involves producing an 
expression or structure that is in some sense a 
representation of the literal meaning of the utterance. 
It is often maintained that understanding what an 
utterance literally means consists in being able to 
recover this representation. In philosophy and 
linguistics this sort of representation is usually said 
to  d isp lay  t h e ~  form o f  an  ut terance ,  so  we w i l l  
re fer  (somewhat loosely-~--  to  the  representat ions  
themse lves  as  " log ica l  fo rms, "  
This paper  surveys  what we at  SRI view as some of 
the  key prob lems encountered in defining a system of 
representation for the logical forms of English 
sentences, and suggests possible approaches to their 
solution. We will first look at some general issues 
related to the notion of logical form, and then discuss 
a number of problems associated with the way information 
involving certain key concepts is expressed in English. 
Although our main concern here is with theoretical 
issues rather than with system performance, this paper 
is not merely speculative. The DIALOGIC system 
currently under development in the SKI Artificial 
Intelligence Center parses English sentences and 
translates them into logical forms embodying many of the 
ideas presented  here. 
II THE NATURE OF LOGICAL FORM 
pieces of the logical form of the utterance that 
constitute referring expressions. Having logical forms 
be semantically compositional is the ultimate expression 
of this kind of decomposability, as it renders ev,ery 
well-formed subexpression a locus of meanlng--and 
therefore a potential locus of meanlng-dependent 
processing. This is probably a more telling argument 
for semantic composltlonality in designing language- 
processing systems than in analyzing human language, but 
it can be reasonably argued that such design principles 
must be followed by any system, whether natural or  
artificial, that has to adapt to a complex environment 
(see \[Simon, 1969\], especially Chapter  4). I 
Logical form, therefore, is proposed as a level of 
representation distinct from surface-syntactlc form, 
because  there  i s  apparent ly  no d i rec t  way to  
semantically interpret natural language sentences in a 
compositional fashion. Some linguists and philosophers 
have challenged th i s  assumption \[Montague, 1974a\] 
\[Barwlse and Cooper, 1981\], but  the complexity of their 
proposed systems and the limited range of syntactic 
forms they consider leave serlous doubt that the 
logical-form level can be completely bypassed. 2 
Beyond be ing  co~pos i t ioue l ,  i t  is des i rab le - - though 
perhaps  not  essent ia l - - that  the  mean ing  of  a log ica l  
form also be independent of the context in which the 
associated utterance occurs. (The meaning of an 
expression in natural language, of course, is often 
context-dependent.) A language-processing system must 
eventually produce a context-independent representation 
of what the speaker means by an utterance because the 
content of the utterance will normally be subjected to 
further processln E after the original context has been 
lost. In the many cases in which the speaker's intended 
meaning is simply the literal meaning, a context- 
i ndependent  logical form would give us the  
representat ion  we need. There is little doubt that some 
representation of this sort is required. For example, 
much of our general knowledge of the world is derived 
from simple assertions of fact in natural language, but 
our situation would be hopeless if, for every fact we 
knew, we had to remember the context in which it was 
obtained before we could use it appropriately. Imagine 
trying to decide what to do with a tax  refund by having 
to recall whether the topic of conversation was rivers 
or financial institutions the first time one heard that 
banks were good places in which to keep money. 
The first question to ask is, why even have a level 
of logical form? After all, sentences of natural 
languages are themselves conveyers of meaning; that is 
what natural languages are for. The reason for having 
logical foznns is to present the literal meanings of 
sentences more perspicuously than do the sentences 
themselves. It is sometimes said that natural-language 
sentences do not '~ear their meanings on their sleeves"; 
logical forms are intended to do exactly that. 
From this perspect ive ,  the  main desideratum for a 
system of logical form is that its semantics be 
compositional. That is, the meaning of a complex 
expression should depend only on the  meaning of its 
subexpresslons. This is needed for meanlnE-dependent 
cou~utational processes to cope with logical forms of 
arbitrary complexity. If there is to be any hope of 
maintaining an intellectual grasp of what these 
processes are doing, they must be decomposable into 
smaller and smaller meanlng-dependent subprocesses 
operating on smaller and smaller meaningful pieces of a 
logical form. For instance, if identifying the entities 
referred to by an utterance is a subprocess of inferring 
the speaker's intentions, there must be identifiable 
As this example suggests, context independence is 
closely related to the resolution of ambiguity. For any 
given ambiguity, it is possible to find a case in which 
the information needed tO resolve it is derived from the 
context of an utterance. Therefore, if the meanlnEs of 
logical forms are to be context-lndependent, the system 
of logical forms must provide distinct, unambiguous 
representations for all possible readings of an 
ambiguous utterance. The question remains whether 
logical form should also provide ambiguous 
representations to handle cases i n  which the 
dlsamblguatlng information is obtained later or is 
simply general world knowledge. The pros and cons of 
such an approach are far from clear, so we will 
generally assume only unembIEuous logical forms. 
Although it is sometimes assumed that a context- 
independent representation of the literal meaning of a 
sentence  can  be der ived  by us ing  syntact i c  and semant ic  
knowledge only, some pragmatic factors must also be 
taken into account. To take a concrete example, suppose 
the request "Please llst the Nobel Prize winners in 
physics," is followed by the question '~dho are the 
Americans?" The phrase "the Americans" in the second 
utterance should almost certainly be interpreted as 
117 
re fer r ing  to  Amer ican  w inners  o f  the  Nobel  P r i ze  in 
physics, rather than all inhabitants or citizens of the 
United States, as It might be understood in isolation. 
If the logical form of the utterance is to reflect the 
intended interpretation, processes that are normally 
assigned to praSmatlcs must be used to  derive i t .  
One could attempt to avoid thls consequence by 
representing "the Americans" at the level of logical 
form as literally meaning all Americans, and have later 
pragmatic processing restrict the interpretation co 
American winners of the Nobel Prize in physics. There 
are other cases, however, for which thls sort of move is 
not  ava i lab le .  Cons ider  more care fu l ly  the  ad jec t ive  
"Amer ican . "  Amer ican  peop le  cou ld  be e i ther  inhab i tants  
o r  c i t i zens  o f  the  Un i ted  States ;  Amer ican  cars  cou ld  be 
e i ther  manufactured  or  d r iven  in  the  Un i ted  States ;  
Amer ican  food  cou ld  be food  produced or  consumed in  o r  
p repared  in  a s ty le  ind igenous  Co the  Un i ted  States .  In 
short, the meaning of "American" seems to be no more 
than "bearing some contextually determined relation to 
the United States." Thus, there is n~o deflnlte context- 
independent mesnlng for sentences containing modifiers 
llke "American." The same is t rue  for many uses of 
"have," "of," possessives, l ocat ive  prepos i t ions  
\[Herskovits, 1980\] and compound nominals. The only way 
to hold fast to the position that the  construction of 
loglcal-form precedes  all pragmatic processing seems to  
be to put in "dummy'* symbols for the unknown relations: 
This m@y in fact be very useful in building an actual 
system, ~ but It is hard to imagine that such a level of 
representation would bear much theoretical weight. 
We will chum assume that  a theoretically 
i n teres t ing  level of logical form will have reso lved  
contextua l ly  dependent  de f in i te  re ferences ,  as  we l l  as  
the  ocher  " loca l "  p ragmat ic  lndeterminac ies  ment ioned.  
An impor tant  consequence  o f  th i s  v iew i s  that  sentences  
per  se do not  have  log ica l  fo rms~ on ly  sentences  in  
context  ~.~-~f  we speak  loose ly  o f  the  log ica l  fo rm o f  
a sentence ,  th i s  i s  how I t  shou ld  be in terpreted .  
If we go thls far, why not say that all pragmaClc 
processing Cakes place before the logical form is 
constructed? That is, why make any distinction at all 
between what  the  speaker  in tends  the  hearer  to  in fe r  
f rom an ut terance  and what  the  ut terance  l i te ra l ly  
means? There  are  two answers  co th i s .  The f i r s t  i s  
that ,  wh i le  the  pragmat ic  fac tors  we have  in t roduced 
in to  the  der ivat ion  o f  log ica l  fo rm so fa r  a re  ra ther  
narrowly c i rcumscr ibed  (e.g., resolving definitely 
determined noun phrases) ,  the  in ference  o f  speaker  
in tent ions  i s  complete ly  open-ended.  The prob lem 
confronting the hearer is to answer the question, 'Why 
would the  speaker say that in this situation?" 
Practically any relevant knowledge chat the speaker and 
hearer mutually possess \[Clark and Marshall, 1981\] 
\[Cohen and Perrault, 1981\] may be brought to bear in 
answering thls quest ion .  Prom a purely ~echodo log ica  ! 
standpoint, then, one would hope to define some more 
restricted notion of meaning as an intermediate step in 
deve lop ing  the  broader  theory .  
Even put t ing  as ide  th i s  methodo log ica l  concern ,  i t  
seems doubt fu l  chat  a theory  o f  in tended mean ing  can  be 
co~trucCed w i thout  a concomitant thaor? of literal 
meaning ,  because  the  la t te r  not ion  appears  to  p lay  an  
exp lanatory  ro le  in  the  fo rmer  theory .  Spec i f i ca l ly ,  
the  l i te ra l  mean ing  o f  an  ut terance  i s  one  o f  chose  
th ings  f rom which  hearers  in fe r  speakers"  in tent ions .  
For  ins tance ,  in the  appropr ia te  context ,  " I 'm get t ing  
co ld"  cou ld  be a request  to  c lose  a w indow.  The on ly  
way fo r  the  hearer  to  unders tand  th i s  as  a request ,  
however ,  is to  recover  the  literal content of the  
utterance, i.e., that the speaker is getting cold, and 
to infer from this chat the speaker would llke him co do 
something about  It. 
In summary, the notion of logical form we wish to 
capture is essentially that of a representation of the 
"literal meaning in context" of an utterance. To 
facilitate further processing, it is virtually essential 
that the meaning of Ioglcal-form expressions be 
compositional and, at the same time, it is highly 
desirable that they be conCext-lndependenc. The latter 
condition requires that a system of logical form furnish 
distinct representations for the dlfferenc readings of 
ambiguous natural-language expressions. I t  also 
requires chat some l im i ted  amount of prag~at lc  
p rocess ing  be invo lved  in  produc ing  those  
representations. Finally, we note  that  not all 
pragmatic factors in the  use of language can be 
reflected in the logical form of an utterance, because 
some o f  those  fac tors  a re  dependent  on  in format ion  that  
the  logical form itself prov ides .  
III FORM AND CONTENT IN KNOWLEDGE P.EP&ESENTJtTION 
Developing a theory of the loglcal form of English 
sentences is as much an exercise in knowledge 
representation as in linguistics, but ic differs from 
most work in  arclficlal intelligence on knowledge 
representat ion  in one key respect .  Knowledge 
representat ion  schemes are  usua l ly  in tended by the i r  
des igners  to  be as  genera l  as  poss ib le  and to  avo id  
com~aitment to any particular concepts .  The essential 
problem for a theory of logical form, however, is co 
represent specific concepts chat natural languages have 
special features for expressing information about. 
Concepts that fall in chls category include: 
* Events, actions, and procesmes 
* Time and space 
* Collective entities and substances 
* Propositional attitudes and modalltles. 
A theory of logical form of natural-language 
express ions ,  there fore ,  i s  p r imar i ly  concerned w i th  the  
content  ra ther  than  the  fo rm o f  representat ion .  Log ic ,  
semant ic  networks ,  f rames ,  sc r ip ts ,  and  product ion  
sys tems are  a l l  d i f fe rent  fo rms of  representat ion .  But 
to  say  mere ly  that  one has  adopted  one  o f  these  fo rms i s  
to  say  noth ing  about  content ,  i . e . ,  what  i s  represented .  
The representat ion  used  in  th i s  paper ,  o f  course ,  takes  
a par t i cu la r  fo rm (h igher -order  log ic  w i th  in tens iona l  
operators )  but  re la t ive ly  l i t t le  w i l l  be sa id  about  
deve lop ing  or  re f in ing  chat  fo rm.  Rather ,  we w i l l  be 
concerned with the question of what particular 
pred icates ,  funct ions ,  operators ,  and  the  l i ke  are  
needed to  represent  the  content  o f  Eng l i sh  express ions  
invo lv ing  concepts  in  the  areas  l i s ted  above .  Th is  
p ro jec t  might  thus  be bet ter  descr ibed  as  knowledge 
encodln 6 to distinguish It from knowledge 
representat ion ,  as i t  i s  usually unders tood  in 
arclflcial intelligence. 
IV A FRAMEWORK FOR LOGICAL FORM 
As ment ioned prev ious ly ,  the  bas ic  f r -mework  we 
w i l l  use  to  represent  the  log ica l  form o f  Eng l i sh  
sentences  i s  h igher -order  log ic  ( i .d . ,  h igher -order  
pred icate  ca lcu lus ) ,  augmented  by in tens iona l  operators .  
At a pure ly  notat iona l  leve l ,  a l l  we l l - fo rmed 
express ions  w i l l  be in  "Cambr idge  Po l i sh"  fo rm,  as  in  
the  programming language LZSP; thus ,  the  log ica l  fo rm o f  
" John  l i kes  Mary"  w i l l  be s imply  (LIKE JOHN MARY). 
Desp i te  our  f i rm be l ie f  in  the  pr inc ip le  of  semant ic  
compos i t iona l t t7 ,  we w i l l  not  a t tempt  co g ive  a fo rmal  
semant ics  fo r  the  log ica l  fo rms we propose .  Hence ,  our  
I18  ? 
adherence Co that principle is a good-falth intention 
rather than a demsnstrated fact. It should be noted, 
though, that  virtually all the kinds of  lo~tcal 
constructs used here are drawn from more formal work of 
logicians and ph i losophers  in which r igorous  semant ic  
treatments are provided. 
The only place in which our logical language 
differs sigulflcancly from more familiar syscezs is In 
the treatment of quantiflers. Normally the English 
determiners "every" and "some" are translated as logical 
quantlfiers that bind a single variable in an arbitrary 
fo rmula .  This requ i res  us ing  an  appropr ia te  log ica l  
connect ive  co combine the  contents  o f  the  noun phrase  
governed by the  determiner  w i th  the  contents  o f  the  res t  
o f  the  sentence .  Thus '~very  P i s  q"  becomes 
(EVERY X (IMPLIES (P X) (q X))), 
and "Some P i s  Q'* becomes 
(SOME X (AND (e X) (q X)))  
I t  seems somewhat i ne legant  to  have  to  use  d i f fe rent  
connect ives  to  Jo in  (P X) and (~ X) in  the  two cases ,  
but  semant ica l ly  i t  works .  
In  an  ext remely  in teres t ing  paper ,  Barwise  and 
Cooper  \ [1981\]  po in t  out  (and ,  in  fac t ,  p rove)  that  there  
are  :any  determiners  in  Eng l i sh  fo r  wh ich  th i s  approach  
does  not  work .  The t rans format ions  employed in  s tandard  
log ic  co hand le  "every"  and "some"  depend on the  fac t  
that  any  s ta tement  about  every  P o r  some P i s  log ica l ly  
equ iva lent  to  a s ta tement  about  everyth ing  or  someth ing ;  
fo r  example, "Some P is Q" is equivalent to "Something 
is P and Q." What Barwlse and Cooper show is that there 
is no such  transformation fo r  determiners like "msst" or 
"more than half." That  iS, statements about most P's or 
more than  ha l f  the  P ' s  cannot  be rephrased  as  s ta tements  
about  most  th ings  or  more than  ha l f  o f  a l l  th ings .  
Barv ise  and Cooper  incorporate  th i s  ins ight  in to  a 
ra ther  e laborate  sys tem modeled a f te r  Montague 's ,  so 
that ,  among other  th ings ,  they  can  ass ign  a denotat ion  
to  a rb i t ra ry  noun phrases  out  o f  context .  Adopt ing  a 
more conservat ive  mod i f i ca t ion  o f  s tandard  log ica l  
notat ion ,  we w i l l  s imp ly  ins i s t  that  a l l  quant i f ied  
fo rmulas  have  an  add i t iona l  e lement  express ing  the  
res t r i c t ion  of the quantifier. '~ost P's are Q" will 
thus be represented  by 
(HOST X (F X) (q X)). 
Following thls convent ion  g ives  us a uniform t reatment  
fo r  determined noun phrases :  
"Most men are  mortal" 
"Some man is mortal" 
"Every man Is mortal" 
"The man iS mortal" 
"Three men are mortal" 
Note that we t reat  
(MOST X (4  X) (MORTAL X)) 
(SOME X (MAN X) (MORTAL X)) 
(EVERY X (MAN X) (MORTAL X)) 
(THE X (MAN X) (MORTAL X)) 
(3 x (HA. X) (MORTJU. X)) 
"the" as a quantifier, on a par 
wlth "some" and "every." "The" is often treated 
formally as an operator  chat  produces  a complex singular 
term, but thls has the disadvantage of not indicating 
clearly the scope of the expression. 
A final point about our basic framework I s  that 
most common nouns will be interpreted as relations 
rather than functions in logical form. That is, even If 
we know that a person has only one height, we will 
represent "John's height is 6 feet" as 
(HEIGE'? JOHN (FEET 6)) 
ra ther  than 
(EQ (HEIGHT JOHN) (FEET 6)) 5 
There  are  two reasons  fo r  th i s :  one i s  the  des i re  fo r  
"syntact i c  un i fo rmi ty ;  the  o ther  i s  co have  a var iab le  
ava i lab le  fo r  use  in  complex  pred icates .  Cons ider  
" John 's  he ight  i s  more than  5 feet  and less  than  6 
feet." If height is a relation, we can say 
(THE L (HEIGHT JOHN L) 
(AND (GT L (FEET 5)) 
(LT L (FEET 6)))), 
whereas, if length is a function, we would say 
(AND (GT (HEIGHT JOHN) (FT 5)) 
(LT (HEIGHT JOHN) (FT 6))) 
The second variant may look simpler, but it has the 
d isadvantage  that (HEIGHT JOHN) appears  twice. This is 
not only syntactically unmotivated, since "John's 
height" occurs only once in the original English but, 
what  i s  worse ,  i t  may lead  Co redundant  prucass lns  la ter  
on.  Let  us  suppose  Chat  we want  to  tes t  whether  the  
asser t ion  i s  t rue  and that  determin ing  John 's  he ight  
requires some expensive operation, such as accessing an 
externa l  database .  To avo id  do ing  the  computat ion  
tw ice ,  the  eva luat ion  procedure  must  be much more 
complex  i f  the  second representat ion  i s  used  ra ther  than  
the  f i r s t .  
V EVENTS, ACTIONS, AND PROCESSES 
The source  of  many prob lems in  th i s  a rea  is the  
quest ion  of  whether  the  t reatment  o f  sentences  that  
descr ibe  events  ( " John  i s  go ing  to  New York" )  shou ld  
d i f fe r  in  any  fundamenta l  way f rom that  o f  sentences  
chat  descr ibe  s ta t i c  s i tuat ions  (* ' John i s  tn  New York" ) .  
In a very  in f luent ia l  paper ,  Dav idson  \[ 1967\] a rgues  
that ,  wh i le  s imple  pred icate /argument  notat ion ,  such  as  
(LOC JOHN mY), may be adequate  fo r  the  la t te r ,  event  
sentences  requ i re  exp l i c i t  re ference  to  the  event  as  an  
ob jec t .  Dav ldson 's  p roposa l  wou ld  have  us represent  
" John  i s  go ing  to  New York"  as  i f  I t  were  somsth ing  l i ke  
"There  i s  an  event  wh/~h I s  a go ing  o f  John  co New 
York" :  
(soME E (EVENT E) (GO E JOHN mY)) 
Dav idson 's  a rguments  fo r  th i s  ana lys i s  a re  that  (1)  many 
adverb ia l  mod i f ie rs  such  as  "qu ick ly"  a re  best  regarded 
as  pred icates  o f  the  events  and  that  42) i t  i s  poss ib le  
co re fer  to  the  event  exp l i c i t l y  in  subsequent  
d i scourse .  ( " John  i s  go ing  co New York .  Th...~e t r ip  w i l l  
take  four  hours . " )  
The prob lem wlth Dav idson 's  p roposa l  i s  that  fo r  
sentences  in  wh ich  these  phenomena do not  a r i se ,  the  
representat ion  becomes unnecessar i l y  complex. We 
there fore  suggest  in t roduc ing  an  event  abst ract ion  
operator ,  EVABS, chat  w i l l  a l low us  to  in t roduce  event  
var iab les  when we need them: 
(P Xl ... X.) <-> 
(SOME E (EVENT E) ((gVABS F) E xl . . .  xn)) 
In simple cases we can use the more straightforward 
fo rm.  The log ica l  form o f  " John  i s  k i ss ing  Mary" wou ld  
s imply  be (KISS JOHN MARY). The log ica l  fo rm o f  " John  
i s  gent ly  k i ss ing  Mary , "  however ,  would  be 
(SOME Z (EVENT E) 
(AND ((EWSS KZSS) Z JoHN ~Y)  
(GENTLE E)))) 
119 
I f  we le t  EVABS apply  to complex pred icates  
( represented  by LAMBDA express ions) ,  we can handle o ther  
problems as well. Consider the sentence "Being a parent 
caused John's nervous breakdown." "Parent"  Is a 
relational noun; thus, if John is a parent, he must he 
the parent  of someone, but i f  John has severa l  ch i ld ren  
we don ' t  want to he forced in to  asser t ing  chat  beinS the 
parent  of any par t i cu la r  one of them caused the 
breakdown. I f  we had PARENTI as the monadic properry  of 
be in  S a parent ,  however, we cou ld  say 
(SOME E (EVENT E) 
(Am) ((EVABS PARENTL) E JOHN) 
(CAUSE E "John's nervous breakdown"))) 
We don ' t  need tO in t roduce  PARENTI exp l i c i t l y ,  however, 
i f  we s imply  subst i tu te  for I t  the expression, 
(LAMBDA X (SOME Y (PERSON Y) (PARENT X Y))), 
which would g ive  us 
(SOME E (EVENT E) 
(AND ((EVANS (LAMBDA X (SOME Y (PERSON Y) 
(PARZNT x z)))) 
Z 
JOHN) 
(CAUSE E "John's nervous breakdown"))) 
Another important  question i s  whether ac t ions - - - chat  
i s ,  events  wlth agents - - shou ld  be t reated  d i f fe rent ly  
from events without agents and, if so, should the agent 
be specially indicated? The po in t  is that, if John 
kissed Mary, that ?s somethln S he did, but not 
necessarily something sh....~e did. Zt is not clear whether 
th i s  d i s t inc t ion  should be represented  at  the leve l  of 
log ica l  form or is ra ther  an in fe rence  based on world 
knowledge. .  
Finally, most AS work on ac t ions  and events  assumes 
that  they can be decomposed in to  d i sc re te  s teps ,  and 
that their effects can be defined in terms of  S final 
s ta te .  Ne i ther  of these  assumpt ions  i s  appropr ia te  fo r  
cont inuous  processes ;  e .g . ,  "The f low of water  cont inued  
to  f lood the basement."  What the log ica l  form fo r  such 
s ta tements  hould look  l i ke  seems co be a complete ly  
open quest ion .  6
VI TIME AND SPACE 
We be l ieve  that  in fo rmat ion  about t ime i s  bes t  
represented  pr imar i l y  by sencent ia l  operators ,  so that  
the logical form of a sentence like "John is in New York 
at  2:00" would be somethln S likm 
(AT 2:00 (LOt JOHN NY)). There are two main reasons for 
following chls approach. First, current time can be 
i nd icated  s imply  by the lack  of any operator ;  e ,g .  , 
"John owns Fido" becomes simply (OWNS JOHN FIDO)o This 
is especially advantageous in baslcsily static dowalns 
in which tlme plays a minimal role, so we do not have to 
put someChln S into the logical form of a sentence chat 
wi l l  be sys temet ica l ly  ignored by l ower - leve l  
p rocess ing .  The o ther  advantage of th i s  approach i s  
that  temporal  operators  can app ly  Co a whole sentence ,  
ra ther  than Just  to a verb .  For ins tance ,  in  the 
pre fer red  read ing  of "The Pres ident  ha8 l i ved  in  the 
White House s ince  1800," the re ferent  of " the  P res ident"  
changes wi th  the t ime contexts  invo lved  in  eva luat in  S
the t ru th  of the sentence .  The o ther  read ing  can be 
obtained by allowing the quanclfier "the" in "the 
President" to assume a wider scope than that of the 
temporal operator. 
Although we do not  s t rong ly  d l s t lnsu lsh  ac t ion  
verbs from s ta t ive  verbs semant ica l ly ,  there  are 
120 
syntact i c  d i s t inc t ions  that  - . , s t  be taken in to  account 
before  tense  can be mapped in to  t ime cor rec t ly .  S ta t ive  
verbs express  present  t ime by means of the s imple  
present  tense ,  wh i le  ac t ion  verbs use the present  
p rogress ive .  Compare: 
John k i sses  Mary (normal ly  hab i tua l )  
John i s  k i ss ln  8 Mary (normal ly  p resent  t ime)  
John owns Pido (normal ly  p resent  t ime)  
John i s  owning Fido (unacceptab le )  
This  i s  why (KISS JOHN MARY) represents  "John i s  k l ss lns  
Mary," ra ther  than "John k i sses  Mary," which would 
nor~s l ly  rece ive  a d i spos i t iona l  or  hab i tua l  
in terpreta t ion .  
What temporal  operators  will be needed? We will 
use the operator  AT to  asser t  that  a cer ta in  cond i t ion  
ho lds  a t  a cer ta in  t ime.  PAST and FUTURE w i l l  be 
pred icates  on po in ts  in  t ime.  Sinq~le past  tense  
s ta tements  w i th  sCaCive verbs ,  such a8 "John was in  New 
York," could mean e i ther  that  John was in  New York a t  
some unspec i f ied  time In  the past  or  a t  a coutexcua/ ly  
spec i f i c  t ime in  the past :  
(SOME T (PAST T) (AT T (LOt JOHN NY))) 
(TME T (PAST T) (AT T (LOC JOHN NY))) 
(For the second express ion  to be an "o f f i c ia l "  lo~tca l -  
form representat ion ,  the  incomplete  de f in i te  re fe rence  
would have to be reso lved . )  Simple fu ture - tense  
s ta tements  wi th  sCaCive verbs a re  para l le l ,  w i th  PUTI~ 
rep lac ing  PAST. Exp l i c i t  tempora l  mod i f ie rs  are 
genera l ly  t reated  as  add i t iona l  res t r i c t ions  on the t ime 
re fer red  to.  "John was in New York on Tuesday" aright be 
(on a t  leas t  one in terpreta t ion) :  
(SOME T (AND (PAST T) (DURING T TUESDAY)) 
(AT ~ (C0C JoHN ~)) ) )  
For ac t ion  verbs we get representat ions  of tk ts  8o f t  fo r  
pas t  and fu ture  progress ive  tenses ;  e .g . ,  " John was 
k i ss ing  Mary" becomes 
(THE T (PAST T) (AT T (KISS JOHN ~. lY ) ) )  
When we use event  abst rac t ion  to in t roduce  
ind iv idua l  events ,  the in teract ions  w i th  t ime become 
somewhat r i cky .  Since (KISS JOHN MAEY) means "John i s

(SOME E (EVENT E) ((EVABS KZSS) E JOHN MAEY)) 
S ince log ica l ly  th i s  formal express ion  means something

as be ing t rue  at  s par t i cu la r  t ime of the events  in

Tha major unso lved problem re lec ing  to t ime se ams

"The colpany earned $5 m4111on in  March." This 
csr ta in Iy  does not moan that  s t  every  po in t  in  t ime

sentences  about po in ts ,  but then we would have the 
difficult task  of constant ly  hav ing to dec ide  which

compl icated  by the fac t  that  the same event ,  e .  S. the

Revolution, France was a--'monarchy," compared wlth 
"During the American Revolution, England suffered a 
decllne in trade.") One would hope that there exist 
systematic relationships between statements about  po in ts  
in time and statements about intervals that can be 
exp lo i ted  in  deve lop in  B a log ica l  fo rm for  tensed  
sentences .  There  i s  a substant ia l  l i te ra ture  in  
ph i losoph ica l  log ic  devoted  to  " tense  log ic"  \ [Rescher  
and Urquhar t ,  1971\] \ [McCawley, 1981\ ] ,  but  a lmost  a l l  of  
th l s  work  see  s :  to  be concerned  wlth  eva luat ing  the  
truth of sentences at points, which, as  we have seen, 
cannot  be immediate ly  extended to  hand le  sentences  about  
intervals. 
We include space under the same heading as tlme 
because a major question about space Is the extent to 
which Its treatment should parallel that of time. From 
an objective standpoint, it is often convenient to view 
physical space and time together as a four-dlmenslonal 
Euclidean space. Furthermore, there are natural- 
language constructions that seem best interpreted as 
asserting that a certain condition holds in a particular 
p lace  ( " In  Ca l i fo rn ia  i t  i s  lega l  to  make a r ight  tu rn  
on a red  l ight" ) ,  Jus t  as  t ime express ions  o f ten  asser t  
that  a cond i t ion  ho lds  a t  a par t i cu la r  t ime.  The 
quest ion  i s  how far  th i s  ana logy  between space  and t ime 
can  be pushed.  
VlI COLLECTIVE ENTITIES AND SUBSTANCES 
Most representat ion  schemes are  des igned to  express  
in fo rmat ion  about  such  d isc rete ,  we l l - ind iv iduated  
ob jec ts  as  peop le ,  cha i rs ,  o r  books .  Not a l l  ob jec ts  
a re  so d i s t inc t ,  however ;  co l lec t ions  and substances  
seem to  pose  special difficulties, Collections are 
often indicated by conjoined noun phrases. If we say 
"Newell and Simon wrote Human Problem Solving," we do 
not  mean that  they each did it individually (cf. 
"Newell and Simon have PhDs."), rather we mean that they 
did it as a unit. Furthermore, if we want the treatment 
of this sentence to be parallel to chat of "~ulne wrote 
Word and Ob ject , "  we need an  exp l i c i t  representat ion  o f  
the  un i t  "Newell and Simon," so that  I t  can  p lay  the  
same role the individual "~ulne" plays in the latter 
sentence. These considerations create difficulties in 
sentence interpretation because of the possibility of 
ambiguities between collective and distributed readings. 
Thus, "Newell and Simon have written many papers," might 
mean that individually each has written many papers or 
that they have jointly coauthored many papers. The 
problems associated with conjoined noun phrases also 
arise with plural noun phrases and singular noun phrases 
that  a re  inherent ly  co l lec t ive .  " John ,  B i l l ,  J oe ,  and 
Sam," "the Jones boys," and "the Jones String Quartet" 
may all refer to the same collective entity, so that an 
adequate  log ica l - fo rm representat ion  needs  to t reat  them 
as much alike as possible. These iss,--S are treated in 
detail by Webber \[1978\]. 
The most  obv ious  approach  to  hand l ing  co l lec t ive  
ent i t ies  i s  to  t reat  them as  sets ,  but  s tandard  set  
theory  does  not  p rov ide  qu i te  the  r ight  logic. The 
in terpretat ion  of  "and"  in  " the  Jones  boys  and the  Smi th  
g i r l s "  would  be the  un ion  o f  two sets ,  but  in " John  and 
Mary" the  in terpretat ion  would be const ruct ing  a set  out  
of  two ind iv idua ls .  A l so ,  the  d i s t inc t ion  made in  set  
theory  between an  ind iv idua l ,  on one hand,  and  the  
s ing le ton  sat  conta in ing  the  ind iv idua l ,  on the  o ther ,  
semas totally artificial in thls context. We need a 
"flatter" kind of structure than is provided by standard 
set theory. The usual formal treatment of strings is a 
useful model; there is no distinction made between a 
character and a string Just one character lens; 
moreover ,  s t r ing  concatenat ion  applies equa l ly  to  
s t r ings  of one character  o r  more than  one .  Co l lec t ive  
ent i t ies  have these  features  in  common wi th  s t r ings ,  but  
share  w i th  sets  the  proper t ies  o f  be ing  uoordered  and 
not  hav ing  repeated  e lements .  
The set  theory  we propose  has  a set  fo rmat ion  
operator  COMB Chat  takes  any  number o f  a rguments .  The 
arguments  o f  COMB may be ind iv idua ls  o r  se ts  of  
ind iv idua ls ,  and  the  va lue  of  COMB i s  the  set  chat  
conta ins  a l l  the  ind iv idua l  a rguments  and a l l  the  
elements of the set arguments; thus, 
(COMB A iS C} D {E F C}) = {A S C D E F G} 
(The notat ion  us ing  braces  i s  NOT par t  o f  the  log ica l -  
fo rm language;  th i s  example  i s  Jus t  an  a t tempt  to  
i l l us t ra te  what  COMB means in  te rms o f  more convent iona l  
concepts.) If A is an individual, (COMB A) is elmply A. 
We need one  o ther  spec ia l  operator  to  hand le  
de f in i te ly  determined p lura l  noun phrases ,  e .g . ,  " the  
Amer ican  sh ips . "  The prob lem i s  that  in  context  th i s  
may re fer  to  some par t i cu la r  se t  o f  Amer ican  sh ips ;  
hence ,  we need to  recogn ize  i t  as  a de f in i te  re ference  
that  has  to  be reso lved .  Fo l low ing  Weber \ [1978\ ] ,  We 
w i l l  use  the  notat ion  (SET X P) to  express  a pred icate  
on sets  that  i s  sa t i s f ied  by any  set ,  a l l  o f  whose 
members sat i s fy  (LAMBDA X P) .  Then " the  P ' s "  would be 
the  contextua l ly  determined set ,  a l l  o f  whose members 
are  P ' s :  
(THE S ((SET X (P X)) S) ...) 
I t  might  seem that ,  to  proper ly  capture  the  mean ing  
of p lura ls ,  we would have to limit the  extens ion  of 
(SET X P) to sets of two or more elements. This is not 
a lways  appropr ia te ,  however .  A l though "There  are  sh ips  
in  the  Med,"  might  seex  to  mean "The set  o f  sh ips  in  the  
Med has  a t  leas t  two members , "  the  quest ion  "Are  there  
any  sh ips  in  the  Med?" does  not  mean "Does the  set  o f  
sh ips  in  the  Mad have  a t  leas t  two members?" The answer  
to  the  fo rmer  quest ion  i s  yes ,  even  i f  there  i s  on ly  one 
sh ip  in  the  Med i ter ranean.  Th is  suggests  Chat  any  
presuppos i t ion  the  p lura l  car r ies  to  the  e f fec t  that  
more than  one ob jec t  i s  invo lved  may be a mat ter  of  
Gr icean  lmpl i ca ture  ( " I f  he knew there  was on ly  one ,  why 
d idn ' t  he say  so?" )  ra ther  than  semant ics .  S imi la r ly ,  
the  p lura l  mark ing  on verbs  seams to  be Jus t  a syntact i c  
re f lex ,  ra ther  than  any  sor t  o f  p lu ra l  operator .  On the  
la t te r  approach  we would  have to  take  "Who k i l l ed  Cock 
Rob in?"  as  amblBuous  between a s ingu lar  and p lura l  
read ing ,  s ince  s inBu lar  and p lura l  verb  forms would be 
semantically distinct. 
To illustrate the use of our notation, we will 
represent "Every one of the men who defeated Hannibal 
was brave . "  S ince  no one defeated  Hann iba l  
ind iv idua l ly ,  th i s  mast  be a t t r ibuted  to  a co l lec t ion  of  
men: 
(soHE T (PAST T) 
(AT T

(EEAVE x) ))) 
Note Chat we can  rep lace  the  p lura l  noun phrase  " the  men 
who defeated Hannibal" by the singular collective noun 
phrase, "the Roman army," as in "Everyone in the  Romeo 
army was brave": 
(SOME T (PAST T)

The only change In the logical form of'the sentence is 
chat IX QUESTIONS AND IMFERATIVE3 
(AND ((SET Y (MAN Y)) S) (DEFEAT S ~NIBAL) )  
is replaced by (AND (ARMY S) (RO~.~N S)). 
Col lec t ive  ent i t ies  a re  not  the  on ly  ob jec ts  that  
a re  difficult to  represent .  Artificial i n te l l igence  
representat ion  schemes have  notor ious ly  sh ied  away f rom 
mass quenc i t ie ?  and  substances .  ( \ [Hayes ,  1978\]  I s  a 
notable exception.) In a sentence like "All Eastern 
coal contains soma sulfur," it see,." tb?\[ "coal" and 
"sulfur" refer to properties of samples or pieces of 
"stuff." We might  paraphrase  thls sentence  as "All 
pieces of stuff that are Eastern coal contain soue  stuff 
that  I s  su l fu r . "  I f  we take  th i s  approach ,  then ,  In  
in terpret ing  a sentence  l i ke  "The Un iverse  I re land  I s  
car ry ing  |00 ,000 bar re l s  o f  Saud i  l ight  c rude , "  we need 
co ind icate  that  the  "p iece  o f  s tu f f "  be ing  descr ibed  i s  
the maximal "piece" of Saudl l i ght  crude the shlp is 
carrying. In other cases, substances seem to be more 
llke abstract individuals, e.g., "Copper is the twenty- 
ninth element in the periodic table." Nouns that refer 
Co substances can also function as do plural noun 
phrases  in the i r  ~ener ic  use :  "Copper  i s  \ [ante lopes  are \ ]  
abundant  in  the  Amer ican  southwest . "  
Vlll PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES AND MODALITIES 
Propos i t iona l  a t t i tudes  and moda l i t ies  a re  
d i scussed  together ,  because  they  are  both  normal ly  
t reated  as  in tens iona l  sentent ia l  operators .  For  
ins tance ,  to  represent  " John  be l ieves  Chat  the  Fox i s  in  
Nap les , "  we wou ld  have  an  operator  BELIEVE that  takes  
" John"  as  i t s  f i r s t  a rgunmnt  and  the  representat ion  o f  
"The Fox is in Naples"  as  I t s  second argument .  
S? , , t la r ly ,  to  represent  '*the Fox might  be  in Naples , "  we 
cou ld  app ly  an" operator  POSSIBLE to  the  representat ion  
o f  "The Fox is in Naples." This approach  works  
par t i cu la r ly  well on a number  of prob lems invo lv ing  
quanCi f ie rs .  For  example, " John  be l ieves  someone i s  in  
the basement s' possesses an ambiguity that is revealed by 
the  two par ?phrases ,  " John  be l ieves  there  i s  someone in  
the  basement"  and "There  i s  someone John  be l ieves  Co be 
in  the  basement . "  As chess  paraphrases  suggest ,  th l s  
d i s t inc t ion  i s  represented  by d i f fe rent  re la t ive  scopes 
of  the  be l ie f  operator  and  the  ex is tent ia l  quant i f ie r  
in t roduced by the  indef in i te  pronoun "someone" :  
(BELIEVE JOHN (SOME X (PERSON X) (LOC X BASEMENT))) 
(SOME X (PERSON X) (BELIEVE JOHN (LOC X ~N~S~IENT))) 
Th is  approach  works  very  we l l  up to  a po in t ,  but  
there  ? re  cases  I t  does  not  hand le .  For  exanp le ,  
somet imes  verbs  l i ke  "be l ieve"  do not  take  a sentenc ?  a ?  
? n ? r s~menc ,  but  ra ther  a descr ip t ion  o f  a sentence ,  
e .g . ,  " John  be l ieves  Go ldbach 's  con jec ture . "  TF we were  
to  make "be l ieve"  a pred icate  ra ther  than  a sentence  
operator  to  hand le  th i s  type  o f  ~m?le ,  the  e legant

i s  t reated  ? s  I f  I t  were  " John  be l leves  o f  Co ldbach 's

ch~ usua l  way f rom " John  be l ieves  that  Co ldbach 's  
- -~-c~nJecture  (whatever  I t  may be)  i s  t rue"  by revers ing  
the  scope  of the  descr ip t ion  "Go ldbach 's  con jec ture"  and 
the  operator  "be l ieve . "  
The on ly  types  of  u t te rances  we have t r ied  Co 
represent  in  log ica l  fo rm to  th i s  po in t  a re  asser t ions ,  
but  o f  course  there  are  o ther  speech  acts  as  we l l .  The 
on ly  two ve  w i l l  cons ider  ? re  quest ions  and imperat ives  
(commands) .  S ince  per fo rmat ives  (promises ,  bets ,  
dec la rat ions ,  e tc . )  have  the  ?a te  syntact i c  fo rm ? s  
asser t ions ,  i t  appears  that  they  ra i se  no new prob lems.  
We wi l l  a l so  concern  ourse lves  on ly  wich the  l i te ra l  
speech act expressed by an utterance.  Dealing wlth 
i nd i rec t  speech acts does noc seem to change the range 
of representations needed; sometimes, fo r  example, we 
may s imply  need to  represent  what  i s  l i te ra l ly  an  
asser t ion  as  somach lng  lnc ?nded as  a command. 
For  quest ion ? ,  we wou ld  l i ke  to  have  a un i fo rm 
t reatment  o f  both  the  yes /no  and WH forms.  The s imples t  
approach  i s  co regard  the  semant ic  content  o f  a WH 
quest ion  to  be a pred icate  whose  extens ion  i s  be ing  
sought .  Th is  does  noc address  the  i ssue  of  what  i s  a 
sat i s fac tory  answer  to  ? quest ion ,  but  we regard  that  as  
par t  o f  the  theory  o f  speech  acts  proper ,  ra ther  than  a 
quest ion  of log ica l  form. We w i l l  introduce the 
operator  WHAT fo r  const ruct lng  complex set  descr ip t ions ,  
wh ich ,  fo r  the  sake  o f  un i fo rmi ty ,  we w i l l  g ive  the  same

represent ? t lon  o f  '~hat  Amer ican  sh ips  a re  in  the  Med?" 
wou ld  rough ly  be as  fo l lows :  
(WHAT X (AND (SHIP X) ~.MERICAN X)) 
(LOC x ~zD)) 
WHAT i s  conven ient ly  mnemonic ,  s ince  we can  represent  
"who" as (WHAT X (PERSON X) .... ), "when" as 
(WHAT X (TZHZ X) . . . .  ) ,  and  so fo r th .  "How many" 
quest ions  wi l l  be t reated  a ?  quest ion ing  the  quant i f ie r .  
'~lov many men ? re  mor ta l? "  wou ld  be represented  a ?  
(WHAT N (Nb~mZR N) 
(N X (MAN X) (MOZTAL X))) 
Yes/no questions can be handled ?s ? degenerate 
case of WH questions by treating a proposition ?s a O- 
ary  pred icate .  S ince  the  exC ?ue ion  of ? n  n -s ty  
pred icate  i s  a set  o f  n - tup les ,  the  extens ion  o f  a 
propos i t ion  wou ld  be a set  o f  0 -~up les .  There  i s  on ly  
one  0 - tup le ,  the  e~ty  top is ,  so  there  ? re  on ly  two 
po ?s lb le  s ? t s  o f  O-~up le ? .  Th ? se  are  the  s ing le to~ set  
conta in ing  the  empty  top is ,  and  the  empty  set ,  wh ich  we 
can identify wlth the truth values TRUE and FALSE. The 
l og ica l  fo rm o f  a yes /no  quest ion  w l th  Che propos i t ion  P 
as  i t s  S 'mant ic  content  wou ld  be (WHAT ( )  TEUE P) ,  o r  
more simply P. 
Wi th  regard  to  imperat ives ,  I t  i s  less  c lear  what 
type  o f  semant ic  ob jec t  Cha i r  content  shou ld  be .  We 
might  propose  that  I t  l ?  a p ropos i t ion ,  but  ve  then  have  
Co account  fo r  the  fact  that  not  ? l l  propos i t ions  are  
acceptab le  as  commands.  For  ins tance ,  John  cannot  be 
commanded "Bill go to  New York . "  The respon ?e  that  a 
person  can  on ly  be "commanded somech lng"  he has cont ro l  
over  i s  not  adequate ,  because any  propos i t ion  can  be 
conver ted  in to  a command by the  verb  "sake" - -e .g . ,  "Make 
Bi l l  So Co New York."  
The awkwerdnas ?  o f  the  phras ing  "command someone 
somath lng"  suggests  another  approach .  One cmmands  
sos 'one  Co d.~o someth ing ,  and  the  th inks  that  a re  done 
are actions. If actions are  treated as objects, we can 
d?flne a relation DO chat map? ?n agent sad an action 
i n to  a propos i t ion  (See  \ [Moore ,  1980\ ] ) .  " John  i s  go ing  
Co New York" would  then  be represented  by 
(DO JO~h~ (GO ~f ) ) .  Ac t ions  are  nov ava i lab le  to  be the  
semant ic  content  of  imperat ives .  The prob lem wi th  th i s  
approach  i s  that  we now have  to  pack  in to  ac t ions  a l l  
the  semant ic  complexities Chat can  ? r i se  in commsnds- 
122 
fo r  ins tance ,  adverb ia l  mod i f ie rs ,  which we have t reated  
above as predicates on events ("Co quickly"), 
quantiflers ("Go to every room in the house"), and 
negation ("Don't go"). 
A third approach, which we feel is actually the 
most promising, is to treat the semantic content of an 
imperative as being a unary  predlcace. The force of an 
imperative 18 that the person to whom the command is 
directed is supposed to satisfy the predlcaCe. 
According to this theory the role of "make" is clear--it 
converts any proposition into a unary predicate. If the 
assertion "John Is making glll go Co NOw York" is 
represented as (MAKE JOHN (GO BILL MY)), we can form a 
unary predicate by LAMBDA abstraction: 
(LAMBDA X (MAKE X (GO gILL mY)), 
which would be the semantic content of the command "Make 
Bill go to New York." 
This approach  does away wlth the prob lem concerning 
adverb ia l  mod i f ie rs  or  quant l f le rs  In  commands; they  can 
s imply  be par t  of  the  propos i t ion  f rom which the  
pred icate  i s  formed.  A f ina l  p iece  of ev idence  favor ing  
th l s  approach  over  a theory  based on the  not ion  of 
ac t ion  i s  that  some imperat ives  have noth ing  a t  a l l  to  
do w l th  ac t ions  d i rec t ly .  The semant ic  content  of 
commands l l ke  "Be good" o r  "Don ' t  be a foo l "  rea l ly  does 
seem to cons is t  exc lus ive ly  of  a p red icate .  
X CONCLUSION 
In a paper  that  covers  such a wide range  of 
d i sparate  top ics ,  i t  i s  hard  to reach  any sweeping 
genera l  conc lus ions ,  but  perhaps  a few remarks  about  the 
nature  and cur rent  s ta tus  of the  research  program are  in 
o rder .  F i r s t ,  i t  shou ld  be c lear  from the i ssues  
d i scussed  that  a t  leas t  as many prob lems remain  in  the  
quest  fo r  log ica l  form as have a l ready  been reso lved .  
Cons ider ing  the  amount of e f fo r t  that  has been expended 
upon natural-language semantics, this is somewhat 
surprising. The reason may be that relatlvely few 
researchers have worked in thls area for its own sake. 
Davldeon's ideas on action sentences, for instance, 
raised some very interesting points about logical form-- 
but the major debate Ic provoked in the philosophical 
llcerature was about the metaphysics of the concept of 
action, noc about the semantics of action sentences. 
Even when semantics is a major concern, as in the work 
of Montague, the emphasis is often on showing chat 
relatively well-understood subareas of semantics (e.g., 
quantificaclon) can be done in a parClcular way, rather 
than on attempting to take on really new problems. 
An additional difficulty is that so much work has 
been done in a fragmentary fashion. It is clear that 
the concept of action is closely related to the concept 
of time, but it is hard to find any work on either 
concept that takes the other one seriously. To build a 
language-processlng system or  a theory of language 
processing, however, requires an integrated theory of 
logical form, not Just a set of incompatible fragmentary 
theories. Our conclusion, then, is chac if real 
progress is to be made on understanding the logical form 
of natural-language utterances, it must be studied in a 
unified way and treated as an important research problem 
in its own right.

NOTES 
I A l though our  immediate  a im i s  to const ruct  a theory  of  
natura l - language process ing  ra ther  than t ru th -  
cond i t iona l  semant ics ,  I t  i s  worth not ing  that a system 
of  logical form wlth a well-deflned semantics 
const i tu tes  a br idge  between the  two pro jec ts .  I f  we 
have a process ing  theory  that  assoc ia tes  Eng l i sh  
sentences with their logical forms, and if those loKical 
forms have a truth-~ondltional semantics, then we will 
have specified the semantics of the English sentences as 
well. 
2 In other papers (e.g., \[Montague, 1974b\]), Montague 
himself uses an intenslonal logic in exactly the role we 
propose for logical form--and for much the same reason: 
'We could ... introduce the semantics of our fraKment 
\ [of  Eng l i sh \ ]  d i rec t ly ;  but  I t  I s  p robab ly  mere 
persp icuous  to  proceed ind i rec t ly  by ( I )  se t t ing  up a 
cer ta in  s imp le  a r t i f i c ia l  l anguage,  that  of tensed  
Intenslonal l og ic ,  (2) giving the  semantics of that  
language, and (3) interpreting English indirectly by 
showing in a rigorous way how to translate it into the 
artificial language. This Is the procedure we shall 
adopt;..." \[Montague, 1974b, p.256\]. 
3 The DIALOGIC system does build such a representation, 
or at least components of one, as an intermediate step 
in deriving the logical form of a sentence. 
4 This suggests chac our logical forms are 
representations of what David Kaplan, in his famous 
unpublished paper on demonstratives \[Kaplan, 1977\], 
calls the content of a sentence, as opposed to Its 
character. Kaplan introduces the content/character 
distinction to sort out puzzles connected wlth the use 
of demonstratives and Indaxlcals. He notes that there 
are at least two different notions of "the meaning of a 
sentence" that conflict when indexical expressions are 
used. If A says to B, "I am hungry," and g says to A, 
"~ am hungry," they have used the same words, but in one 
sense they mean different things. After all, it may be 
the case that what A said is true and what B said is 
false. If A says to g, "~ am hungry," and B says to A, 
"You are hungry," they have used different words, but 
mean the same thing, that A is hungry. This notion of 
"meaning different things" or "meaning the same thing" 
is one kind of meaning, which Kaplan calls "content." 
There Is another sense, though, In which A and g both 
use the words "I am hungry" with the same meanlng, 
namely, that the same rules apply to determine, in 
context, what content is expressed. For thls notion of 
meaning, Kaplan uses the term "character." Kaplan's 
notion, therefore, is that the rules of the language 
determine the character of a sentence--whlch, in turn, 
together wlth the context of utterance, determines the 
content. If ~ broaden the scope of Kaplan's theory to 
include the local pragmatic indetermlnacles we have 
discussed, i t  seems Chec the  way they depend on context 
would also be part of the character of a sentence and 
Chat our logical form is thus a representation of the 
content of the sentence-ln-context. 
5 It should be obvious from the example that nouns 
referring to unlCs of measure--e.g., "feet"--are an 
exception co the general rule. We treat types of 
quanCitles, such as distance, weight, volume, time 
123 
duracioo, etc., as basic conceptual categories. 
Following Hayes \[1979\], unlCs such as feet, pounds, 
gallons, and hours are considered to be functions from 
numbers,to quantities. Thus (FEET 3) and (YARDS l) 
denote the same distance. Halations llke length, 
weight, size, and duration hold between an entity and a 
quantity of an appropriate type. Where a word llke 
"welghc" serves in English to refer co both the relaClon 
and the quantity, we must be careful Co dlsClngulsh 
between chem. To see the dlscincCion, note Chac length,  
beam, and draft are all relaclons between a ship and a 
quanClcy of the same type, discance. We treat 
comparatives llke "greater than" as molcidomain 
relaclons, working with any two quanciCles of the same 
type (or wich pure numbers, for chac matter) .  
6 Hendrix \[1973\], Rieger \[1975\], Hayes \[1978\], and 
McDermott \[1981\] have a l l  dea l t  with conClnuous 
processes co some extent ,  buc none of them has 
considered specifically how language expresses 
information about processes. 
7 This point was impressed upon me by Pat Hayes.
