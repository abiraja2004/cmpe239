Abstract
Manual annotation of natural language to
capture linguistic information is essen-
tial for NLP tasks involving supervised
machine learning of semantic knowledge.
Judgements of meaning can be more or
less subjective, in which case instead of
a single correct label, the labels assigned
might vary among annotators based on the
annotators? knowledge, age, gender, intu-
itions, background, and so on. We intro-
duce a framework ?Anveshan,? where we
investigate annotator behavior to find out-
liers, cluster annotators by behavior, and
identify confusable labels. We also in-
vestigate the effectiveness of using trained
annotators versus a larger number of un-
trained annotators on a word sense annota-
tion task. The annotation data comes from
a word sense disambiguation task for pol-
ysemous words, annotated by both trained
annotators and untrained annotators from
Amazon?s Mechanical turk. Our results
show that Anveshan is effective in uncov-
ering patterns in annotator behavior, and
we also show that trained annotators are
superior to a larger number of untrained
annotators for this task.

2 Introduction
Manual annotation of language data in order to
capture linguistic knowledge has become increas-
ingly important for semantic and pragmatic an-
notation tasks. A very short list of a few such
tasks illustrates the range of types of annotation,
in varying stages of development: predicate ar-
gument structure (Palmer et al, 2005b), dialogue
acts (Hu et al, 2009), discourse structure (Carbone
et al, 2004), opinion (Wiebe and Cardie, 2005),
emotion (Alm et al, 2005). The number of ef-
forts to create corpus resources that include man-
ual annotations has also been growing. A common
approach in assessing the resulting manual anno-
tations is to report a single quantitative measure
reflecting the quality of the annotations, either a
summary statistic such as percent agreement, or
an agreement coefficient from the family of met-
rics that include Krippendorff?s alpha (Krippen-
dorff, 1980) and Cohen?s kappa (Cohen, 1960).
We present some new assessment methods to use
in combination with an agreement coefficient for
understanding annotator behavior when there are
multiple annotators and many annotation values.
Anveshan (Annotation Variance Estimation)1 is
a suite of procedures for analyzing patterns of
agreement and disagreement among annotators,
as well as the distributions of annotation values
across annotators. Anveshan thus makes it pos-
sible to explore annotator behavior in more detail.
Currently, it includes three types of analysis: inter-
annotator agreement (IA) among all subsets of an-
notators, leverage of annotation values for outlier
detection, and metrics for comparing annotators?
distributions of annotation values (e.g., Kullbach-
Liebler divergence).
As an illustration of the utility of Anveshan, we
compare two groups of annotators on the same an-
notation word sense annotation tasks: a half dozen
trained annotators and fourteen Mechanical Turk-
ers. Previous work has argued that it can be cost
effective to collect multiple labels from untrained
labelers at a low cost per label, and to combine
the multiple labels through a voting method, rather
than to collect single labels from highly trained la-

search or exploration.

belers (Snow et al, 2008; Sheng et al, 2008; Lam
and Stork, 2003). The tasks included in (Snow et
al., 2008), for example, include word sense an-
notation; in contrast to our case, where the av-
erage number of senses per word is 9.5, the one
word sense annotation task had three senses. We
find that the same half dozen trained annotators
can agree well or not on sense labels for poly-
semous words. When they agree less well, we
find that it is possible to distinguish between prob-
lems in the labels (e.g., confusable senses) and
systematic differences of interpretation among an-
notators. When we use twice the number of Me-
chanical Turkers as trained annotators for three of
our ten polysemous words, we find inconsistent re-
sults.
The next section of the paper presents the moti-
vation for Anveshan and its relevance to the word
sense annotation task, followed by a section on
related work. The word sense annotation data is
given in section 5. Anveshan is described in the
subsequent section, followed by the results of its
application to the two data sets. We discuss the
comparison of trained annotators and Mechanical
Turkers, as well as differences among words, in
section 7. Section 7 concludes with a short recap
of Anveshan in general, and its application to word
sense annotations in particular.
3 Beyond Interannotator Agreement (IA)
Assessing the reliability of an annotation typically
addresses the question of whether different anno-
tators (effectively) assign the same annotation la-
bels. Various measures can be used to compare
different annotators, including agreement coeffi-
cients such as Krippendorff?s alpha (Krippendorff,
1980). Extensive reviews of the properties of such
coefficients have been presented elsewhere, e.g.,
(Artstein and Poesio, 2008). Briefly, an agree-
ment produce values in the interval [-1,1] indicat-
ing how much of the observed agreement is above
(or below) agreement that would be predicted by
chance (value of 0). To measure reliability in this
way is to assume that for most of the instances in
the data, there is a single correct response. Here
we present the use of reliability metrics and other
measures for word sense annotation, and we as-
sume that in some cases there may not be a single
correct response. When annotators have less than
excellent agreement, we aim to examine possible
causes.
We take word sense to be a problematic anno-
tation to perform, thus requiring a deeper under-
standing of the conditions under which annotators
might disagree. The many reasons can only be
touched on here. For example, word senses are
not discrete, atomic units that can be delimited and
enumerated. While dictionaries and other lexical
resoures, such as WordNet (Miller et al, 1993) or
the Hector lexicon (cf. SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff
and Palmer, 2000)), do provide enumerations of
the senses for a given word, and their interrela-
tions (e.g., a list of senses, a tree of senses), it is
widely agreed that this is a convenient abstraction,
if for no other reason than the fact that words shift
meanings along with the communicative needs of
the groups of individuals who use them. The con-
text in which a word is used plays a significant role
in restricting the current sense. As a result, it is
often argued that the best representation for word
meaning would consist in clustering the contexts
in which words are used (Kilgarriff, 1997). Yet
even this would be insufficient because new com-
munities arise, new behaviors and artifacts emerge
along with them, hence new contexts of use and
new clusters. At the same time, contexts of use
and the senses that go along with them can fade
away (cf. the use of handbag discussed in (Kilgar-
riff, 1997) pertaining to disco dancing). Because
an enumeration of word senses is somewhat arti-
ficial, annotators might disagree on word senses
because they disagree on the boundaries between
one sense and another, just as professional lexi-
cographers do.
Apart from the artificiality of creating flat or
hierarchical sense inventories, the meanings of
words can vary in their subjectivity, due to differ-
ences in the perception or experience of individu-
als. This can be true for word senses that are inher-
ently relative, such as cold (as in, turn up the ther-
mostat, it?s too cold in here); or that derive their
meaning from cultural norms that may differ from
community to community, such as justice; or that
change as one grows older, e.g., whether a long
time to wait pertains to hours versus days.
Despite the arguments against using word sense
inventories, until they are replaced with an equally
convenient and more representative abstraction,
they are an extremely convenient computational
representation. We rely on WordNet senses, which
are presented to annotators with a gloss (defini-
tion) and with example uses. In order to better un-
48
derstand reasons for disagreement on senses, we
collect labels from multiple annotators. When an-
notators agree, having multiple annotators is re-
dundant. But when annotators disagree, having
multiple annotators is necessary in order to de-
termine whether the disagreement is due to noise
based on insufficiently clear sense definitions ver-
sus a systematic difference between individuals,
e.g., those who see a glass as half empty where
others see it as half full. To insure the opportu-
nity to observe how varied the labeling of a single
word can be, we collect word sense annotations
from multiple annotators. One potential benefit of
such investigation might be a better understanding
of how to model word meaning.
In sum, we hypothesize the following cases:
? Outliers: A small proportion of annotators
may assign senses in a manner that differs
markedly from the remaining annotators.
? Confusability of senses: If multiple annota-
tors assign multiple senses in an apparently
random fashion, it may be that the senses are
not sufficiently distinct.
? Systematic differences among subsets of an-
notators: If the same 50% of annotators al-
ways pick sense X where the remaining an-
notators always pick sense Y, it may be that
properties of the annotators, such as their age
cohort, account for the disagreement.
4 Related Work
There has been a decade-long community-wide ef-
fort to evaluate word sense disambiguation (WSD)
systems across languages in the four Senseval ef-
forts (1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007, cf. (Kilgarriff,
1998; Pedersen, 2002a; Pedersen, 2002b; Palmer
et al, 2005a)), with a corollary effort to investi-
gate the issues pertaining to preparation of man-
ually annotated gold standard corpora tagged for
word senses (Palmer et al, 2005a).
Differences in IA and system performance
across part-of-speech have been examined, as
in (Ng et al, 1999; Palmer et al, 2005a). Fac-
tors that have been proposed as affecting agree-
ment include whether annotators are allowed to as-
sign multilabels (Ve?ronis, 1998; Ide et al, 2002;
Passonneau et al, 2006), the number or granu-
larity of senses (Ng et al, 1999), merging of re-
lated senses (Snow et al, 2007), sense similar-
ity (Chugur et al, 2002), entropy (Diab, 2004;
Palmer et al, 2005a), and reactions times required
to distinguish senses (Klein and Murphy, 2002;
Ide and Wilks, 2006).
We anticipate that one of the ways in which the
data will be used will be to train machine learning
approaches to WSD. Noise in labeling and the im-
pact on machine learning has been discussed from
various perspectives. In (Reidsma and Carletta,
2008), it is argued that machine learning perfor-
mance does not vary consistently with interannota-
tor agreement. Through a simulation study, the au-
thors find that machine learning performance can
degrade or not with lower agreement, depending
on whether the disagreement is due to noise or sys-
tematic behavior. Noise has relatively little impact
compared with systematic disagreements. In (Pas-
sonneau et al, 2008), a similar lack of correla-
tion between interannotator agreement and ma-
chine learning performance is found in an empiri-
cal investigation.
5 Word Sense Annotation Data
5.1 Trained Annotator data
The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)
project (Ide et al, 2010) is creating a small,
representative corpus of American English written
and spoken texts drawn from the Open American
National Corpus (OANC).2 The MASC corpus
includes hand-validated or manual annotations
for a variety of linguistic phenomena. The first
MASC release, available as of May 2010, consists
of 82K words.3 One of the goals of MASC is
to support efforts to harmonize WordNet (Miller
et al, 1993) and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al,
2006), in order to bring the sense distinctions each
makes into better alignment.
We chose ten fairly frequent, moderately poly-
semous words for sense tagging. One hundred oc-
currences of each word were sense annotated by
five or six trained annotators. The ten words are
shown in Table 1, the words are grouped by part of
speech, with the number of WordNet senses, the
number of senses used by the trained annotators
(TAs), the number of annotators, and Alpha. We
call this the Trained annotator (TA) data.
We find that interannotator agreement (IA)
among half a dozen annotators varies depending
on the word. For ten words nearly balanced with

Table 1: Interannotator agreement on ten poly-
semous words: three adjectives, three nouns and
four verbs among trained annotators
respect to part of speech, we find a range of about
0.50 to 0.70 for nouns and adjectives, and about
0.37 to 0.46 for verbs. Table 1 shows the ten words
and the alpha scores for the same five or six an-
notators. The layout of the table illustrates both
that verbs have lower agreement than adjectives
or nouns, and that within each part of speech, an-
notators achieve varying levels of agreement, de-
pending on the word. The annotators, their level
of training, the number of sense choices, the anno-
tation tool, and other factors remain constant from
word to word. Thus we hypothesize that the differ-
ences in IA reflect differences in the degree of sub-
jectivity of the sense choices, the sense similarity,
or both. Anveshan is a data exploration framework
to help understand the differences in the ability of
the same annotators to agree well on sense anno-
tation for some words and not others.
As shown, annotators achieve respectable
agreement on long, time and work, and lower
agreement on the remaining words. Verbs have
lower agreement overall.

tion GUI developed in Java. The sense number ap-

Table 2: Interannotator agreement on adjectives

(HITs) such as sense annotation for words in a
sentence, can be set up and results from a large
number of annotators (or turkers) can be obtained
quickly. We used Mechanical Turk to obtain anno-
tations from 14 annotators on the set of adjectives
to analyze IA for a larger set of untrained annota-
tors.
The task was set up to get 150 occurrences an-
notated for each of the three adjectives: fair, long
and quiet, by 14 mechanical turk annotators each.
100 of these occurrences were the same as those
done by the trained annotators. For each word,
the 150 instances were divided into 15 HITs of 10
instances each. The average submit time of a HIT
was 200 seconds. We report the IA among the Me-
chanical Turk annotators using Krippendorff?s Al-
pha in Table 2. As shown, the turkers have poor
agreement, particularly on long and quiet, which
is at the chance level.
6 Anveshan
Anveshan: Annotation Variance Estimation, is
our approach to perform a more subtle analysis
of inter-annotator agreement. Anveshan uses sim-
ple statistical methods to achieve the three goals
identified in section 3: outlier detection, confus-
able senses, and distinct subsets of annotators that
agree with each other.
6.1 Method
This section uses the following notation to explain
Anveshan?s methodology:
We assume that we have n annotators annotat-
ingm senses. The probability of annotator a using
sense si is given by
Pa(S = si) =
count(si, a)
?m
j=1 count(sj , a)
where, count(si, a) is number of times si was
used by a.

1 primarily temporal sense; being or indicating a relatively great or greater than average duration or passage of time
or a duration as specified: ?a long life?; ?a long boring speech?; ?a long time?; ?a long friendship?;
?a long game?; ?long ago?; ?an hour long?
2 primarily spatial sense; of relatively great or greater than average spatial extension or extension as specified:
?a long road?; ?a long distance?; ?contained many long words?; ?ten miles long?
3 of relatively great height: ?a race of long gaunt men? (Sherwood Anderson); ?looked out the long French windows?
Figure 1: Three of the WordNet senses for ?Long?
Anveshan uses the Kullbach-Liebler divergence
(KLD), Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and
Leverage to compare probability distributions.
The KLD of two probability distributions P and
Q is given by:
KLD(P,Q) =
?
i
P (i) log
P (i)
Q(i)
JSD is a modified version of KLD, it is also
known as total divergence to the average, and is
given by:
JSD(P,Q) =
1
2
KLD(P,M) +
1
2
KLD(Q,M)
where
M = (P + Q)/2
We define Leverage Lev of probability distribu-
tion P over Q as:
Lev(P,Q) =
?
k
|P (k) ?Q(k)|
We now compute the following statistics:
? For each annotator ai, we compute Pai .
? We compute Pavg, which is (
?
i Pai)/n.
? We compute Lev(Pai , Pavg),?i
? Then we compute JSD(Pai , Paj ) ?(i, j),
where i, j ? n and i 6= j
? Lastly, we compute a distance measure for
each annotator, by computing the KLD be-
tween each annotator and the average of
the remaining annotators, i.e. we get
?i,Dai = KLD(Pai , Q), where Q =
(
?
j 6=i Paj )/(n? 1)
These statistics give us a deeper understanding
of annotator behavior. Looking at the sense us-
age probabilities, we can identify how frequently
senses are used by an annotator. We can see how
much an annotator deviates from the average sense

tween two annotators gives us a measure of how
close they are to each other. KLD of an annota-
tor with the remaining annotators shows us how
different the annotator is from the rest. In the fol-
lowing section we show results, which illustrate
the effectiveness of Anveshan in identifying use-
ful patterns in the data from the trained annotators
(TAs) and Mechanical Turkers (MTs).
6.2 Results
We used Anveshan on all data from TAs and MTs.
We were successful in correctly identifying out-
liers on many words. Also, analyzing the sense
usage patterns and observing the JSD and KLD
scores gave us useful insights on annotator differ-
ences. In the figures for this section, the six TAs
are represented by their unique identifiers (A101,
A102, A103, A105, A107, A108). Word senses
are identified by adding 100 to the WordNet sense

number. An additional ?None of the Above? label
is represented as 999; annotators select this when
no sense applies, when the word occurs as part of
a large lexical unit (collocation) with a clearly dis-
tinct meaning, or when the sentence is not a cor-
rect example for other reasons (e.g., wrong part of
speech).
Figure 2 shows the distance measure (KLD) for
each annotator from the rest of the annotators for
the word long with respect to the probability for
each of the four senses used (cf. Table 1). It can
be clearly seen that annotator A108 is an outlier.
A108 differs in her excessive use of label 999, as
shown in Figure 3. Indeed, by dropping A108,
we see that the IA score (Alpha) jumps from 0.67
to 0.8 for long. Similar results were obtained
for annotations for other words as well. Table 3
shows the jump in IA score after outlier(s) were
dropped.
Anveshan helps us differentiate between noisy
disagreement versus systematic disagreement.
The word show with 5 annotators has a low
agreement score of 0.45. By looking at the
sense distributions for the various annotators,
and observing annotation preferences for each
annotator, we can see that annotators A102 and
A105 have similar behavior (Figure 4, with a
pairwise alpha of 0.52 versus 0.46 for all five

annotators), and annotators A107 and A108 have
similar behavior (Figure 5, with a pairwise alpha
of 0.53). In contrast, Annotator A101 has very
distinct preferences (Figure 6). This behavior
is captured by computing JSD scores among all
pairs of annotators. As can be seen in Figure 7,
the pairs A102-A105 and A107-A108 have very
low JSD values, indicating similarity in annotator
behavior. At the same time we also see the pairs
having A101 in them have a much higher JSD
score, which is attributed to the fact that A101
is different from everyone else. If we look at
corresponding Alpha scores, we see that pairs
having low JSD values have higher agreement
scores and vice versa.
Observing the sense usage distributions also
helps us identify confusable senses. For example,
Figure 8 shows us the differences in sense usage
patterns of A101, A103 and the average of all
annotators for the word say. We can see that
A101 and A103 deviate in distinct ways from the
average. A101 prefers sense 101 whereas A103
prefers sense 102. This indicates that sense 101
and 102 might be confusable. Sense 1 is given
as ?expressing words?; sense 2 as ?report or
maintain?.

Figure 11: Sense usage distribution among TAs
and MTs for fair
Anveshan not only helps us understand under-
lying patterns in annotator behavior and remove
noise from IA scores, but also helps identify
cases where there is no noise and no systematic
subsets of annotators that agree with each other.
An example can be seen in for the noun work. We
observed that the annotators do not have largely
different behavior, which is reflected in Figure 9.
As none of the annotators are significantly differ-
ent from the others, the KLD scores are low and
the plotted line does not have any steep rises, as
seen in Figure 2.
Similar to the results for TA data, Anveshan
was successful in identifying outliers in Mechan-
ical Turk data as well. In order to compare the
agreement among TAs and MTs, we looked at IA
scores of all subsets of annotators for the three ad-
jectives in the Mechanical Turk data. We observed
that MTs used much more senses than TAs for all
words and that there was a lot of noise in sense us-
age distribution. Figure 10 illustrates the sense us-
age statistics for long among MTs, for frequently
used senses.
We also looked at agreement scores among all
subsets of MTs to see if there are any subsets of
annotators who agree as much as TAs, and we ob-
served that for both long and quiet, there were no
53
subsets of MT annotators whose agreement was
comparable or greater than the same number of the
TAs, however for fair, we found one set of 5 an-
notators whose IA score (0.61) was greater than
the IA score (0.54) of trained annotators. We also
observed that among both these pairs of annota-
tors, the frequently used senses were the same, as
illustrated in Figure 11. Still, the two groups of an-
notators have sufficiently distinct sense usage that
the overall IA for the combined set drops to 0.43.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
For annotations on a subjective task, there are
cases where there is no single correct label. In
this paper, we presented Anveshan, an approach to
study annotator behavior and to explore datasets
with multiple annotators, and with a large set of
annotation values. Here we looked at data from
half a dozen trained annotators and fourteen un-
trained Mechanical Turkers on word sense anno-
tation for polysemous words. The analysis using
Anveshan provided many insights into sources of
disagreement among the annotators.
We learn that IA Scores do not give us a com-
plete picture and it is necessary to delve deeper
and study annotator behavior in order to identify
noise possibly due to sense confusability, to elim-
inate noise due to outliers, and to identify system-
atic differences where subsets of annotators have
much higher IA than the full set.
The results from Anveshan are encouraging and
the methodology can be readily extended to study
patterns in human behavior. We plan to extend
our work by looking at JSD scores of all subsets
of annotators instead of pairs, to identify larger
subsets of annotators who have similar behavior.
We also plan to investigate other statistical meth-
ods of outlier detection such as the orthogonalized
Gnanadesikan-Kettenring estimator.
