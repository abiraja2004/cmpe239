Abstract 
We aim to investigate cross-cultural patterns 
of thought through cross-linguistic investiga-
tion of the use of metaphor.  As a first step, 
we produce a system for locating instances of 
metaphor in English and Spanish text.  In con-
trast to previous work which relies on re-
sources like syntactic parsing and WordNet, 
our system is based on LDA topic modeling, 
enabling its application even to low-resource 
languages, and requires no labeled data.  We 
achieve an F-score of 59% for English. 
1 Introduction 
Patterns in the use of metaphors can provide a 
great deal of insight into a culture. Cultural differ-
ences expressed linguistically as metaphor can play 
a role in matters as complex and important as dip-
lomatic relations.  For instance, Thornborrow 
(1993) discusses the different metaphors that are 
used in the context of security in French and Brit-
ish coverage of two major post-cold-war summit 
meetings.  Example metaphors such as ?the corner-
stone of the new security structure,? ?structures for 
defence and security cooperation,? and ?the emerg-
ing shape of Europe,? exemplify the English use of 
the source concept structure in describing the tar-
get concept of security.  In contrast, the metaphors 
?des r?gles de s?curit? nouvelles (new rules of se-
curity)?, ?une r?vision fondamentale des disposi-
tions de s?curit? (a fundamental revision of 
security provisions)?, and ?un syst?me de s?curit? 
europ?en (a system of European security)? exem-
plify the French use of the more abstract source 
concept system to describe the same target concept.  
As Thornborrow notes, the implied British concep-
tion of security as ?concrete, fixed, and immobile? 
contrasts deeply with the French conception of se-
curity as ?a system as a series of processes.? 
Our ultimate goal is to use metaphor to further 
our knowledge of how different cultures under-
stand complex topics.  Our immediate goal in this 
paper is to create an automated system to find in-
stances of metaphor in English and Spanish text. 
Most existing work on metaphor identification 
(Fass, 1991; Martin, 1994; Peters and Peters, 2000; 
Mason, 2004; Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Gegigan et 
al., 2006; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Shutova 
et  al., 2010; Shutova et al, 2012)1 has relied 
on some or all of handwritten rules, syntactic pars-
ing, and semantic databases like WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) and FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998).  
This limits the approaches to languages with rich 
linguistic resources.  As our ultimate goal is broad, 
cross-linguistic application of our system, we can-
not rely on resources which would be unavailable 
in resource-poor languages.  Instead, we apply 
LDA topic modeling (Blei et al, 2003b) which 
requires only an adequate amount of raw text in the 
target language.  This work is similar to Bethard et 
al. (2009), in which an SVM model is trained with 
LDA-based features to recognize metaphorical 
text. There the work is framed as a classification 
task, and supervised methods are used to label 
metaphorical and literal text.  Here, the task is one 
of recognition, and we use heuristic-based, unsu-

pervised methods to identify the presence of meta-
phor in unlabeled text. We hope to eliminate the 
need for labeled data which, as discussed in 
Bethard et al (2009) and elsewhere, is very diffi-
cult to produce for metaphor recognition. 
2 Terminology 
We will refer to a particular instance of metaphori-
cal language in text as a linguistic metaphor.  
Each such metaphor talks about a target concept 
in terms of a source concept.  For example, in 
?Dems, like rats, will attack when cornered? the 
source concept is animals and the target concept is 
politicians2, or at a higher level, governance.  The 
abstract mapping between a source concept and a 
target concept will be referred to as a conceptual 
metaphor which is grounded by a collection of 
linguistic metaphors. 
In this work, we restrict our attention to a single 
target concept, governance.  Our definition of gov-
ernance is broad, including views of the governed 
and those who govern, institutions of government, 
laws, and political discourse.  We used a large col-
lection (see Table 1) of potential source concepts.  
Beginning with the source concepts of primary 
metaphors, which are hypothesized to be univer-
sal (Grady, 1998), we expanded our set to include 
source concepts commonly found in the scientific 
literature about metaphor, as well as those found 
by human annotators manually collecting instances 
of governance-related metaphors.

3 High-level system overview 
 
Figure 1: System Overview 
 
Our main hypothesis is that metaphors are likely to 
be found in sentences that exhibit evidence of both 
a source and a target concept.  The core idea of our 
system is to use LDA topics as proxies for seman-
tic concepts which may serve as the source or tar-
get for a metaphor.  For a given language, we build 
an LDA model from Wikipedia and then align its 
topics to potential source and target concepts, 
which are defined by small human-created lists of 
seed words. 
At runtime, the system first does LDA infer-
ence on our input corpus to get topic probabilities 
for each document and sentence.  The system then 
selects those sentences linked by LDA to both a 
source-aligned topic and a target-aligned topic.3 
For example, a sentence containing ??virtud so-
                                                          
3 This is a distant, automatic relative of the ?directed-search? 
technique of Martin (1994). 
59
cial para construir la democracia??4 will be se-
lected because LDA strongly associates it with 
both the topic [elecciones, ministro, sucesor, ?]5, 
aligned to the target concept governance, and the 
topic [edificio, arquitectura, torre,?] 6, aligned to 
the source concept physical structure.  
Next, the system identifies the words in each 
selected sentence that are strongly associated with 
each concept. In the sentence above, it marks vir-
tud and democracia as target-associated and con-
struir as source-associated. 
Next it applies two filters. First, we exclude any 
sentence with too few words that are not LDA 
stopwords, because the model's predictions may be 
very inaccurate in these cases.  Second, if the topic 
associated with the source model for a sentence is 
also a top-ranked topic for the document as a 
whole, the sentence is excluded.  The reason for 
this is that if the source concept is present through-
out the document, it is probably being used literal-
ly (see Figure 2). 
Finally, it uses previously-computed infor-
mation to determine a final score.  All linguistic 
metaphors scoring above a certain threshold are 
returned.  By varying this threshold, the user can 
vary the precision-recall tradeoff as needed. A dia-
gram of the system can be found in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 2: Even though the last sentence is relevant to the 
source concept pathways and the target concept govern-
ance, it will be correctly rejected because pathways-
aligned topics are present throughout the document. 
4 Implementation Details: Training 
Our runtime system requires as input an LDA 
model, a list of seed words for each concept, and 
an alignment between concepts and LDA topics. 
4.1 LDA Topic Model 
The topics defined by LDA topic modeling serve 
as stand-ins for the more abstractly-defined source 
and target concepts underlying the metaphors.  The 
input to training our LDA model is the full text of

5 elections, minister, successor 
6 building, architecture, tower 
Wikipedia articles in the target language.  Wikipe-
dia is available in numerous languages and serves 
as a corpus of general knowledge, providing us 
with topics corresponding to a broad range of con-
cepts.  Our LDA model is trained using MALLET 
(McCallum, 2002) for 1000 iterations with 100 
topics, optimizing hyperparameters every 10 itera-
tions after a 100 iteration burn-in period. The 500 
most common tokens in the training corpus were 
used as stopwords. The result of LDA is 100 top-
ics, where each topic is a probability distribution 
over the training corpus vocabulary.  Representa-
tive words for example English topics are shown in 
Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3: Sample LDA topics with representative terms 
4.2 Concept Seed Word Lists 
For each concept  , we have a label and a small set 
of seed words representing that concept, referred to 
as     .  These lists were created by hand in Eng-
lish and then translated into Spanish by native 
speakers. The translation was not intended to be 
exact; we instructed the annotators to create the 
lists in a way that was appropriate for their lan-
guage and culture.  For instance, the football topic 
for English describes American football, but in 
Spanish, the same topic describes soccer. 
4.3 Concept-Topic Alignment 
The final input to our system is an alignment be-
tween concepts and topics, with every topic being 
mapped to at most one concept.  In addition to the 
seed lists and LDA model, this alignment process 
takes a score threshold        and a maximum 
number of alignments per source and target con-
cept   and  .  
The alignment algorithm is as follows. We 
align each topic   to the concept   with the maxi-
mum score       , which measures the concept 
terms? summed probability in the LDA topic: 
                      .  We remove all align-
ments where                . Finally, for each 
concept, only the   highest scoring alignments 
are kept, where   may be different for source and

Table 2: Sample concepts, manually-created seed lists, 
and aligned topics 
A last condition on the topic-concept alignment 
is the assignment of topics to trump concepts. Our 
only trump concept in this study is war. If an LDA 
topic is aligned with both the war concept and the 
governance concept, it is removed from alignment 
with the governance concept. We do this because 
war is so tightly associated with governments that 
the alignment algorithm invariably aligns it to the 
governance topic.  However, war is also a very 
important source concept for governance meta-
phors; our choice is to suffer on recall by missing 
some governance-relevant sentences, but increase 
recall on metaphors for which the source concept is 
war. Sample topic-concept alignments are shown 
inTable 2. By inspecting the resulting alignments 
by hand, we chose the following parameter values 
for both languages:       =0.01,  =3,  =5.   
The process of defining concepts is simple and 
fast and the alignment method is inexpensive.  
Therefore, while we have not captured all possible 
source concepts in our initial list, expanding this 
list is not difficult.  We can define new source con-
cepts iteratively as we analyze metaphors that our 
extraction system misses, and we can add target 
concepts as our interests broaden. 
5 Implementation Details: Runtime 
The system receives as input a corpus of docu-
ments, their LDA decodings, the LDA decodings 
of each sentence treated as a separate document, 
and the topic-concept alignments. Each four-tuple 
          is processed independently, where   is 
the language,   is the source concept,   is the tar-
get concept, and   is the sentence. 
 
Determining Concept Relevance: Recall our 
basic intuition that a sentence relevant both to an 
LDA topic in      (termed source-relevant) and 
one in      (termed target-relevant) is potentially 
metaphorical.  The system judges a sentence   to 
be  -relevant if the probability of  -aligned topics 
in that sentence is above a threshold:       
                      , where        is an ad-
justable parameter tuned by hand.         is 0.06 in 
English and 0.05 in Spanish.        is 0.1 in both 
languages. On the source side, the system removes 
all topics in      from        and renormalizes 
before determining relevance in order to avoid pe-
nalizing sentences for having very strong evidence 
of relevance to governance in addition to providing 
evidence of relevance to a source concept.  For 
reference below, let                    (a 
measure of how strongly the sentence is associated 
with its topics) and let 
                            (the most proba-
ble  -aligned topic in the sentence). 
If   is not both source- and target-relevant, the 
system stops and the sentence is not selected. 
 
Finding Concept-Associated Words: The system 
next creates sets    of the words in   associated 
with the concept  .  Let                   .  
Then let   
  {                   , where 
      is a hand tuned parameter set to 0.1 for both 
languages. That is, any word whose probability in 
the topic is higher than a theshold is included as a 
concept-associated word in that sentence.  Let 
               and vice-versa. Note that words 
which could potentially be associated with either 
concept are associated with neither.  For reference 
below, let                      (the most 
strongly concept-associated words in the sentence) 
61
and                    (the combined 
strength of those associations).  
If   lacks words strongly associated with the 
source and target concepts (that is,    or    is 
empty), the system stops and the sentence is not 
selected. 
Filters: The system applies two filters. First,   
must have at least four words which are not LDA 
stopwords; otherwise, the LDA predictions which 
drive the system's concept-relevance judgements 
tend to be unreliable.  Second, the most likely 
source topic       must not be one of the top 10 
topics for the document as a whole, for reasons 
described above.  If either of these requirements 
fail, the system stops and the sentence is not se-
lected. 
Final Scoring: Finally, the system determines 
if  
  (  (     )  (     )            )         
where        is a hand-tuned threshold set to -10.0 
for English and -13.0 for Spanish.  This takes into 
account the strength of association between topics 
and the sentence, between the annotated words and 
the topics, and between the topics and their aligned 
concepts.  Any sentence passing this threshold is 
selected as a linguistic metaphor. 
6 Example Output 
We provide examples of both true and false posi-
tives extracted by our system.  The annotations of 
source and target-associated words in each sen-
tence are those defined as    and    above.  The 
source concept animals is used for all examples.

Examples 1 through 4 are correct metaphors ex-
tracted by our system.  In each, some words related 
to the target concept governance are described us-
ing terms related to the source concept animals.  
Example 1 best represents the desired output of our 
system, such that it contains a governance- and 
animals-relevant metaphor and the terms associat-
ed with the metaphor are properly annotated. Some 
issues do arise in these true positive examples. Ex-
ample 2, while often termed a simile, is counted as 
a metaphor for our purposes.  In example 3, the 
source term is correctly annotated, but the target 
terms should be political ambitions rather than  
Obama.  It is unclear why the term snakehead but 
not the term fish in example 4 is associated with 
the source concept.  
Examples 5 through 8 represent system errors.  
In example 5, the fact that the word whopper oc-
curs frequently to describe a large animal (espe-
cially a fish) causes the sentence to be mistakenly 
identified as relevant to the source concept animal.  
The source term animal in example 6 is clearly 
relevant to the source concept, but it is being used 
literally.  The document-level source concept fil-
tering does not entirely eliminate this error class.  
While example 7 contains a metaphor and has 
some relationship to American politics, it would be 
counted as an error in our evaluations because the 
metaphor itself is not related to governance. In ex-
ample 8, we have two errors. First, tea is strongly 
present in the topic aligned to the animal concept, 
causing the sentence to be incorrectly marked as 
source-relevant. Second, because our topic model 
operates at the level of individual words, it was 
unable to recognize that tea here is part of the 
fixed, governance-related phrase tea party. 7 
7 Evaluation 
7.1 Collecting Evaluation Data 
We collected a domain-specific corpus in each 
language.  We curated a set of news websites and 
governance-relevant blogs in English and Spanish 
and then collected data from these websites over 
the course of several months. For each language, 
we ran our system over this corpus (all steps in 
                                                          
7 an American political movement 
62
Section 5), produced a set of linguistic metaphors 
for each topic-aligned source concept (the target 
concept was always governance), and ranked them 
by the final score (Section 4.4). Below, we will 
refer to the set of all linguistic metaphors sharing 
the same source and target concept as a conceptual 
metaphor. 
7.2 Simple Evaluation 
For this evaluation, we selected the top five exam-
ples for each conceptual metaphor.  If the same 
sentence was selected by multiple conceptual met-
aphors, it was kept for only the highest scoring 
one.  We then added enough of the highest-ranked 
unselected metaphors to create a full set of 300. 
We then added random sentences from the corpus 
that were not selected as metaphorical by the sys-
tem to bring the total to 600.  Our Spanish annota-
tors were unavailable at the time this evaluation 
took place, so we are only able to report results for 
English in this case. 
For each of these instances, two annotators 
were asked the question, ?Is there a metaphor 
about governance in this example?? These annota-
tors had previous experience in identifying meta-
phors for this study, both by searching manually in 
online texts and evaluating previous versions of 
our system.  Over time we have given them feed-
back on what does and does not constitute a meta-
phor.  In this case, the annotators were given 
neither the system's concept-word association an-
notations nor the source concept associated with 
the instance.  In one way, the evaluation was gen-
erous, because any metaphor in the extracted sen-
tence would benefit precision even if it was not the 
metaphor found by our system. On the other hand, 
the same is true for the random sentences; while 
the system will only extract metaphors with source 
concepts in our list, the annotators had no such 
restriction. This causes the recall score to suffer.  
The annotation task was difficult, with a  -score of 
0.48.  The resulting scores are given in Table 3.   
The examples given in Section 5 illustrate the error 
classes found among the false positives identified 
by the human annotators. There are many cases 
where the source-concept associated terms are used 
literally rather than metaphorically, and many cas-
es where the system-found metaphor is not about 
governance.  Some text processing issues, such as 
a bug in our sentence breaking script, as well as the 
noisy nature of blog and blog comment input, 
caused some of the examples to be difficult to in-
terpret or evaluate.

7.3 Stricter Evaluation 
Common Experimental Setup 
We did a second evaluation of both English and 
Spanish using a different paradigm.  For each lan-
guage, we selected the 250 highest-ranked linguis-
tic metaphor instances in the corpus.  Subjects on 
Amazon Mechanical Turk were shown instances 
with the system-predicted concept-associated 
words highlighted and asked if the highlighted 
words were being used metaphorically (options 
were yes and no).  Each subject was randomly 
asked about roughly a quarter of the data. 
 
We paid the subjects $10 per hour.  We added 
catch trial sentences which asked the subject to 
simply answer yes or no as a way of excluding 
those not actually reading the sentences.  Subjects 
answering these questions incorrectly were exclud-
ed (17 in English, 25 in Spanish).  
We defined the metaphoricity of an instance to 
be the fraction of subjects who answered yes for 
that instance. We define the metaphoricity of a 
conceptual metaphor as the average metaphoricity 
of its groundings among the instances in this eval-
uation set.

English Results 
We restricted our subjects to those claiming to 
be native English speakers who had IP addresses 
within the U.S. and had 115 participants.  The ex-
amples were grouped into 66 conceptual meta-
phors. The mean metaphoricity of instances was 
0.41 (standard deviation=0.33).  The mean meta-
phoricity of the conceptual metaphors (Figure 4), 
was 0.39 (SD=0.26).  Although there was wide 
variance in metaphoricity across conceptual meta-
phors, it appears likely that most of the conceptual 
metaphors discovered by the system are correct: 
65% of the conceptual metaphors had metaphorici-
ty greater than 0.25, and 73% greater than 0.2. 
Given that many metaphors are conventional and 
difficult to detect in natural language (Lakoff and 
Johnson, 1980), it is possible that even in cases in 
which only a minority of subjects detected a meta-
phor, a metaphor nonetheless exists 
Spanish Results 
We restricted our subjects to those claiming to be 
native speakers of Mexican Spanish with IP ad-
dresses in the US (57) or Mexico (29).  The in-
stances were grouped into 52 conceptual meta-
phors.  The mean metaphoricity of instances was 
0.33 (SD=0.23) and for conceptual metaphors 
(Figure 4), 0.31 (SD=0.16). 60% of conceptual 
metaphors had metaphoricity greater than 0.25, and 
73% greater than 0.2.  That performance was only 
slightly lower than English is a positive indication 
of our method?s cross-linguistic potential. 
8 Discussion and Future Work 
We observed a number of problems with our ap-
proach which provide avenues for future research. 
8.1 Topics as Proxies of Primary Metaphor 
Concepts 
Many of the metaphors missed by our system were 
instances of primary metaphor, especially those 
involving movement and spatial position.  Our 
LDA approach is poorly suited to these because the 
source concepts are not well-characterized by word 
co-occurrence: words describing movement and 
spatial position do not have a strong tendency to 
co-occur with other such words, at least in Wik-
ipedia.  Augmenting our system with a separate

64
approach to primary metaphor would boost its per-
formance significantly. 
8.2 Topics as Proxies of Non-Primary Meta-
phor Concepts 
We found that most of our potential source con-
cepts did not correspond to any LDA topic. How-
ever, many of these, such as wild west, have fairly 
strong word co-occurrence patterns, so they plau-
sibly could be found by a different topic modeling 
algorithm.  There are two promising approaches 
here which could potentially be combined.  The 
first is to use a hierarchical LDA algorithm (Blei et 
al, 2003b) to allow concepts to align to topics with 
varying degrees of granularity, from the very gen-
eral (e.g. war) to the very specific (e.g. wild west).  
The second is to use constrained LDA approaches 
(Andrzejewski and Zhu, 2009; Hu et al, 2010) to 
attempt to force at least one topic to correspond to 
each of our seed concept lists.   
A different approach would leave behind seed 
lists entirely.  In our current approach, only about 
one third of the topics modeled by LDA are suc-
cessfully aligned with a source concept from our 
hand-made list.  However, some non-aligned LDA 
topics have properties similar to those that were 
chosen to represent source concepts.  For instance, 
the topic whose highest ranked terms are [institute, 
professor, engineering, degree] is comprised of a 
set of semantically coherent and concrete terms, 
and could be assigned a reasonably accurate label 
such as higher education.  If we were to choose 
LDA topics based on the terms? coherence and 
concreteness (and perhaps other relevant, measura-
ble properties), then assign a label using a method 
such as that in Mei et al (2007), we would be able 
to leverage more of the concepts in the LDA mod-
el. This would increase the recall of our system, 
and also reduce some of the confusion associated 
with incorrect labeling of concepts in linguistic and 
conceptual metaphors.  Applying Labeled LDA, as 
in Ramage et al (2009), would be a similar ap-
proach. 
8.3 Confusion of Literal and Metaphorical 
Usage of Source Concepts 
Another major problem was the confusion between 
literal and metaphorical usage of source terms.  
This is partly addressed by our document topics 
filter, but more sophisticated use of document con-
text for this purpose would be helpful.  A similar 
filter based on contexts across the test corpus 
might be useful. 
8.4 Fixed Expressions 
Some of our errors were due to frequent fixed 
phrases which included a word strongly associated 
with a source topic, like Tea Party.  Minimum de-
scription length (MDL) phrase-finding or similar 
techniques could be used to filter these out.  Initial 
experiments performed after the evaluations dis-
cussed above show promise in this regard. Using 
the MDL algorithm (Rissanen, 1978), we devel-
oped a list of likely multi-word expressions in the 
Wikipedia corpus.  We then concatenated these 
phrases in the Wikipedia corpus before LDA mod-
eling and in the test corpus before metaphor pre-
diction.  Though we did not have time to formally 
evaluate the results, a subjective analysis showed 
fewer of these fixed phrases appearing as indica-
tors of metaphor (as words in    or   ). 
8.5 Difficulty of Annotation 
A different method of presentation of metaphors to 
the subjects, for instance with annotations marking 
where in the sentence we believed metaphor to 
exist or with a suggestion of the source concept, 
may have improved agreement and perhaps the 
system?s evaluation score. 
8.6 Summary 
We have presented a technique for linguistic and 
conceptual metaphor discovery that is cross-
linguistically applicable and requires minimal lin-
guistic resources.  Our approach of looking for 
overlapping semantic concepts allows us to find 
metaphors of any syntactic structure.  The frame-
work of our metaphor discovery technique is flexi-
ble in its ability to incorporate a wide variety of 
source and target concepts. The only linguistic re-
sources the system requires are a corpus of gen-
eral-knowledge text adequate for topic modeling 
and a small set of seed word lists. We could im-
prove our system by applying new research in au-
tomatic topic modeling, by creating new filters and 
scoring mechanisms to discriminate between literal 
and figurative word usages, and by creating train-
ing data to allow us to automatically set certain 
system parameters.
