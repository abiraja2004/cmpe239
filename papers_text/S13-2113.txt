Abstract
This paper presents UoS, a graph-based Word
Sense Induction system which attempts to
find all applicable senses of a target word
given its context, grading each sense accord-
ing to its suitability to the context. Senses
of a target word are induced through use of
a non-parameterised, linear-time clustering al-
gorithm that returns maximal quasi-strongly
connected components of a target word graph
in which vertex pairs are assigned to the same
cluster if either vertex has the highest edge
weight to the other. UoS participated in
SemEval-2013 Task 13: Word Sense Induc-
tion for Graded and Non-Graded Senses. Two
system were submitted; both systems returned
results comparable with those of the best per-
forming systems.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the task of automat-
ically discovering word senses from text. In princi-
ple, WSI avoids reliance on a pre-defined sense in-
ventory.1 Whereas the related task of Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) can only assign pre-defined
senses to words on the basis of context, WSI fol-
lows the dictum that ?The meaning of a word is its
use in the language.? (Wittgenstein, 1953) to dis-
cover senses through examination of context of use
in large text corpora. WSI, therefore, may be applied
1In practice, evaluation of a WSI system requires the use of
a gold standard sense inventory such as WordNet (Miller et al,
1990) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006).
to discover new, rare, or domain specific senses;
senses undefined in existing sense inventories.2
Previous WSI evaluations (Agirre and Soroa,
2007; Manandhar et al, 2010) have approached
sense induction in terms of finding the single most
salient sense of a target word given its context.
However, as shown in Erk and McCarthy (2009), a
graded notion of sense may be more applicable, as
multiple senses of the target word may be perceived
by readers. The SemEval-2013 WSI evaluation de-
scribed in this paper is designed to explore the possi-
bility of finding all perceived senses of a target word
in a single contextual instance. The aim for partici-
pants in the task is therefore to design a system that
will induce a set of graded (weighted) senses of a
target word in a particular context.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 in-
troduces SemEval-2013 Task 13: Word Sense In-
duction for Graded and Non-Graded Senses; Sec-
tion 3 presents UoS, the system that participated in
the task; Section 4 reports evaluation results, show-
ing that UoS returns scores comparable with those
of the best performing systems.
2 SemEval-2013 Task 13
2.1 Aim
The aim for participants in SemEval-2013 Task 13:
Word Sense Induction for Graded and Non-Graded
Senses is to construct a system that will: (1) induce
the senses of a given set of target words and (2), label
each test set context (instance) of a target word with
2Surveys of WSI and WSD approaches are found in Navigli
(2009) and Navigli (2012).
689
all applicable target word senses. Candidate senses
are drawn from the WordNet 3.1 sense inventory.
Systems must therefore return a set of graded senses
for each target word in a particular context, where a
numeric weight signifies (grades) each sense?s appli-
cability to the context. A non-graded sense is simply
the highest graded (weighted) sense out of all graded
senses.
2.2 Test Set
The test set consists of 4806 instances of 50 target
words: 20 verbs (1901 instances), 20 nouns (1908),
and 10 adjectives (997).3 Instances are extracted
from the Open American National Corpus, being a
mix of both written and spoken contexts of target
words.4 Only 542 instances are assigned more than
one sense by annotators, thus have graded senses.
This figure somewhat detracts from the task?s aim as
just 11.62% of the test set can be assigned graded
senses.
2.3 Evaluation Measures
Systems are evaluated in two ways: (1) in a WSD
task and (2), a clustering task. In the first evalu-
ation, systems are assessed by their ability to cor-
rectly identify which WordNet 3.1 senses of the tar-
get word are applicable in a given instance, and to
quantify, and so, rank, senses according to their level
of applicability. The supervised evaluation method
of previous SemEval WSI tasks (Agirre and Soroa,
2007; Manandhar et al, 2010) is applied to map in-
duced senses to WordNet 3.1 senses, with the map-
ping function of Jurgens (2012) used to account for
the applicability weights. Three evaluation metrics
are used -
? Jaccard Index: measures the overlap between
gold standard senses and those returned by a
WSI system.
? Positionally-Weighted Kendall?s Tau: measures
the ability of a system to rank senses by their
applicability.
3Stated as 4664 instances on the task website. Note that the
figure of 4806 is for the revised test set.
4http://www.americannationalcorpus.org/
OANC/index.html.
? Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (NDCG): measures the agreement in ap-
plicability ratings, accounting for both the
ranking and difference in weights assigned to
senses.
In the second evaluation, similarity between a partic-
ipant?s clustering solution and that of the gold stan-
dard set of senses is measured using two metrics -
? Fuzzy Normalised Mutual Information (NMI):
extends the method of Lancichinetti et al
(2009) to compute NMI between overlapping
(fuzzy) clusters. Fuzzy NMI measures the
alignment of system and gold standard senses
independently of the cluster sizes, so returns a
measure of how well a WSI system would per-
form regardless of the sense distribution in a
corpus.
? Fuzzy B-Cubed: adapts the overlapping B-
Cubed measure defined in Amigo? et al (2009)
to the fuzzy clustering setting. As an item-
based, rather than cluster-based, measure,
Fuzzy B-Cubed is sensitive to cluster size skew,
thus captures the expected performance of a
WSI system on a new corpus where the sense
distribution is the same.
3 The UoS System
The UoS system uses a graph-based model of word
co-occurrence to induce target word senses as fol-
lows:
3.1 Constructing a Target Word Graph
A graph G = (V,E) is constructed for each tar-
get word. V is a set of vertices and E ? V ? V
a set of edges. Each vertex v ? V represents a
word found in a dependency relation with the tar-
get word. Words are extracted from the dependency-
parsed version of ukWaC (Ferraresi et al, 2008). In
this evaluation V consists of the 300 highest ranked
dependency relation words.5 Words are ranked us-
ing the Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information
5|V | = 300 was found to return the best results on the trial
set over the range |V | = [100, 200, 300, ..., 1000].
690
(NPMI) measure (Bouma, 2009)6, defined for two
words w1, w2 as:
NPMI(w1, w2) =
(
log p(w1,w2)p(w1) p(w2)
)
?log p(w1, w2)
. (1)
An edge (vi, vj) ? E is a pair of vertices. An edge
represents a symmetrical relationship between ver-
tices vi and vj ; here, that words wi and wj co-occur
in ukWaC contexts. Each edge (vi, vj) is assigned
a weight w(vi, vj) to quantify the significance of
wi, wj co-occurrence, the weight being the value re-
turned by NPMI(wi, wj).
3.2 Clustering the Target Word Graph
A clustering algorithm is applied to the target word
graph, partitioning it to a set of clusters. Each
set of words in a cluster is taken to represent a
sense of the target word. The clustering algorithm
applied is MaxMax, a non-parameterised, linear-
time algorithm shown to return good results in pre-
vious WSI evaluations (Hope and Keller, 2013).
MaxMax transforms the weighted, undirected target
word graph G into an unweighted, directed graph
G?, where edge direction in G? indicates a maximal
affinity relationship between two vertices. A ver-
tex vi is said to have maximal affinity to a vertex
vj if the edge weight w(vi, vj) is maximal amongst
the weights of all edges incident on vi. Clusters are
identified by finding root vertices of quasi-strongly
connected (QSC) subgraphs in G? (Thulasiraman
and Swamy, 1992). A directed subgraph is said to
be QSC if, for any vertices vi and vj , there is a root
vertex vk (not necessarily distinct from vi and vj)
with a directed path from vk to vi and a directed path
from vk to vj .7
3.3 Merging Clusters
MaxMax tends to generate many fine-grained sense
clusters. Clusters are therefore merged using two
measures: cohesion and separation (Tan et al,
6Application of the Log Likelihood Ratio measure (Dun-
ning, 1993) returned the same set of words. Though not re-
quired here, NPMI has the useful properties that: if w1 and w2
always co-occur NPMI = 1; if w1 and w2 are distributed as ex-
pected under independence NPMI = 0, and if w1 and w2 never
occur together, NPMI = ?1.
7MaxMax is described in detail in Hope and Keller (2013).
2006). The cohesion of a cluster Ci is defined as:
cohesion(Ci) =
?
x?Ci,
y?Ci
w(x, y)
|Ci|
. (2)
Separation between two clusters Ci, Cj is defined
as:
separation(Ci, Cj) = 1?
?
?
?
?
x?Ci,
y?Cj
w(x, y)
|Ci| ? |Cj |
?
?
? .
(3)
Cluster pairs with high cohesion and low separation
are merged, the intuition being that words in such
pairs will retain a relatively high degree of semantic
similarity. High cohesion is defined as greater than
average cohesion. Low separation is defined as a re-
ciprocal relationship between two clusters: if a clus-
ter Ci has the lowest separation to a cluster Cj (out
of all clusters) and Cj the lowest separation to Ci,
then the two (high cohesion) clusters are merged.8
3.4 Assigning Graded Word Senses to Target
Words
Each test instance is labelled with graded senses of
the target word. A score is computed for the test in-
stance and each target word cluster as the reciprocal
of the separation measure, where Ci is the set of con-
tent words in the instance (nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs, minus the target word itself) and Cj ,
the words in the cluster. The cluster with the lowest
separation score is taken to be the most salient sense
of the target word, with all other positive separation
scores taken to be perceived, graded senses of the
target word in that particular instance.
4 Evaluation Results
Two sets of results were submitted. The first, UoS
(top 3), returns the three highest scoring senses for
each instance; the second, UoS (# WN senses), re-
turns the n = number of target word senses in Word-
Net 3.1 most cohesive clusters, as defined by Equa-
tion (2).
Results for the seven participating WSI systems
are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The ten baselines,
provided by the organisers of the task, are -
8The average number of WordNet 3.1 senses for target
words is 8.58. MaxMax returns an average of 59.54 clusters for
target words; merging results in an average of 21.86 clusters.

As noted by the task?s organisers11, the SemCor
scores are the fairest baselines for participating sys-
tems to compare against as they have no knowledge
of the test set sense distribution; the other baselines
are more challenging as they have knowledge of the
test set sense distribution and annotator grading.
4.1 Summary Analysis of Evaluation Results
Given the number of evaluation metrics (16 in total
on the task website), individual analysis of system
results per metric is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, a ranking of systems may be obtained by
taking a summed ranked score; that is, by adding
10For the random senses baselines, induced senses are
mapped to WordNet 3.1 senses using the mapping procedure
described in Agirre and Soroa (2007). The mapping is provided
by the task organisers.

up each system?s rankings over all evaluation met-
rics. The summed ranking finds that UoS (top 3)
is placed first. If the WSD and cluster-based eval-
uations are considered separately, then UoS (top 3)
is ranked, respectively, first and fourth. However,
this result is countered by the relatively poor per-
formance of UoS (# WN senses), being ranked fifth
overall. Considering baselines, UoS (top 3) equals
or surpasses the SemCor baseline scores 67% of the
time, and 54% for the more challenging baselines;
UoS (# WN senses) scores, respectively, 50% and
44%.
All instances results were supplemented with
single-sense (non-graded) and multi-sense (graded)
splits at a later date.12 These results show (again,
using a ranked score) that for single-sense instances,
AI-KU is the best performing system, with UoS (top
3) placed fifth, and UoS (# WN senses) last. Both
UoS (top 3) and UoS (# WN senses) surpass the
SemCor MFS baseline, with UoS (top 3) surpassing
or equalling the harder baselines 79% of the time,
and UoS (# WN senses) 68% of the time. For multi-
sense instances, AI-KU is, again, the best perform-
ing system, with UoS (# WN senses) placed sec-
ond and UoS (top 3) sixth. UoS (top 3) surpasses
or equals the SemCor baseline scores 67% of the
time; UoS (# WN senses) 83% of the time. UoS
(top3) passes/equals, the harder baselines 63% of the
time, with UoS (# WN senses) doing so 67% of the
time. These results are somewhat confounding as
12http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/
task13/index.php?id=results (4/4/2013)
one would expect a system that performs well in the
main set of results (all instances), as UoS (top 3)
does, to do so in at least one of the single-sense /
multi-sense splits: this is clearly not the case. In-
deed, the results suggest that UoS (# WN senses),
found to perform poorly over all instances, is better
suited to the task?s aim of finding graded senses.
5 Conclusion
This paper presented UoS, a graph-based WSI sys-
tem that participated in SemEval-2013 Task 13:
Word Sense Induction for Graded and Non-Graded
Senses. UoS applied the MaxMax clustering algo-
rithm to find a set of sense clusters in a target word
graph. The number of clusters was found automati-
cally through identification of root vertices of max-
imal quasi-strongly connected subgraphs. Evalua-
tion results showed the UoS (top 3) system to be
the best performing system (all instances), if a sim-
ple ranking over all evaluation measures is applied.
The second system, UoS (# WN senses), performed
poorly, being ranked fifth out of the seven participat-
ing WSI systems. Note, however, that the number of
evaluation metrics applied, and the wide variability
in each system?s performances over different met-
rics and different splits of instance types, make it
difficult to judge exactly which system is the best
performing. Future research therefore aims to carry
out a detailed analysis of the results and to assess
whether the measures applied in the evaluation ade-
quately reflect the performance of WSI systems.
