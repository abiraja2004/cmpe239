ABSTRACT 
This paper describes a general formalism for integrating two  
or more speech recognition technologies, which could be devel- 
oped at different research sites using different recognition strate- 
gies. In this formalism, one system uses the N-best search strat- 
egy to generate a list of candidate sentences; the list is rescorred 
by other systems; and the different scores axe combined to opti- 
mize performance. Specifically, we report on combining the BU 
system based on stochastic segment models and the BBN sys- 
tem based on hidden Markov models. In addition to facilitating 
integration of different systems, the N-best approach results in 
a large reduction in computation for word recognition using the 
stochastic segment model 
INTRODUCTION 
While most successful systems to date have been based 
on hidden Markov models (HMMs), there may be utility in 
combining the HMM approach with some other very differ- 
ent approach. For example, the research group at Boston 
University is exploring the use of the Stochastic Segment 
Model (SSM) \[9,11\] as an alternative to the HMM. In con- 
trast to the HMM, the SSM scores a phoneme as a whole 
entity, allowing a more detailed acoustic representation. I  
previous work \[6\], it was demonstrated that the SSM is ef- 
fective in the task of phoneme recognition, with results on 
the TIMIT database using context-independent phoneme 
models that are comparable to context-dependent HMMs. 
Thus, there is a good possibility that, with the proper use 
of context, the performance may surpass that of the HMM 
system. Unfortunately, the computation required for the 
SSM is considerably greater than that for HMMs, making 
it impractical to implement the standard optimal dynamic 
programming search algorithms. 
In this paper, we introduce a general formalism for inte- 
grating different speech recognition technologies, which also 
enables evaluation ofword recognition performance with the 
SSM. In this approach, one recognition system uses the N- 
best search strategy to provide a list of sentence hypothe- 
ses. A second system (presumably more complex) is used to 
rescore these hypotheses, and the scores of the different sys-

terns are combined, giving a new ranking of the sentence hy- 
potheses. If the errors made by the two systems differ, then 
combining the two sets of scores would yield an improve- 
ment in overall performance ( ither in terms of the percent 
of correct sentences or the average rank of the correct sen- 
tence). The N-best formalism offers a means of reducing 
the computation associated with combining the results of 
two systems by restricting the search space of the second 
system. It therefore also provides a lower cost mechanism 
for evaluating word recognition performance of the SSM by 
itself, through simply ignoring the scores of the HMM in 
reranking the sentences. 
In the following section, we describe the integration method- 
ology in more detail. Next, we present experimental results 
combining the stochastic segment model with the BBN By- 
blos system, including a result that incorporates statistical 
grammar scores as well as a benchmark result using the 
word-pair grammar. Finally, we conclude with a discussion 
of possible implications and extensions of this work. 
INTEGRATION STRATEGY 
The basic approach involves 
1. computing the N best sentence hypotheses with one 
system; 
2. rescoring this list of hypotheses with a second system; 
and 
3. combining the scores to improve overall performance. 
Although the scores from more than two systems can be 
combined using this methodology, we consider only two sys- 
tems here. The BBN Byblos system was used to generate 
the N best hypotheses, and the Boston University SSM sys- 
tem was used to rescore the N hypotheses. Details of each 
step, based on the use of these two systems, are given below. 
N-Best  Scoring 
The idea of scoring the N best sentence hypotheses was 
introduced by BBN as a strategy for integration of speech 
83 
and natural anguage \[3\]. Given a list of N candidate sen- 
tences, a natural anguage system could process the differ- 
ent hypotheses until reaching one that satisfied the syntactic 
and semantic onstraints of the task. An exact, but some- 
what expensive algorithm for finding the N best sentence 
hypotheses was also described in \[3\]. Since then, several 
sites have adopted the N-Best strategy for combining speech 
recognition with natural language. In addition, more effi- 
cient approximate scoring algorithms for finding the N Best 
sentences have been developed (e.g., \[12,13\]). These algo- 
rithms introduce only a short delay after finding the 1-Best 
hypothesis for finding the N-Best hypotheses. 
This same N-best scoring paradigm can be used for the 
integration of different recognition techniques. The main 
difference is that, for the rescoring application, it is useful to 
have the word and/or phoneme boundaries associated with 
this hypothesis. Since the recognition algorithm involves 
maximizing the joint probability of the HMM state sequence 
and the observed ata, the boundaries can be obtained from 
the traceback array typically used in decoding. 
Rescoring 
Rescoring the list of hypotheses i  a constrained recogni- 
tion task, where the phoneme and/or word sequence is given 
and the phonetic segmentation is optionally given. Here we 
use a stochastic segment model in rescoring, but any acous- 
tic model would be useful in this formalism. (For example, 
a neural network model of phoneme segments i used in \[1\].) 
The constrained recognition search is particularly useful for 
segmental coustic models, which have a significantly larger 
recognition search space than frame-based hidden Markov 
models. 
If the phoneme segmentations are given and assumed 
fixed, the computation required for rescoring is extremely 
small. If the phoneme segmentations are not given for the 
N hypotheses, then rescoring is essentially automatic seg- 
mentation. The maximum likelihood segmentation is given 
by a dynamic programming algorithm, typically with min- 
imum and maximum phoneme duration constraints, as in 
\[9\]. Scoring a sentence with the optimal segmentation for a 
model will yield better results than scoring according to the 
segmentation determined by a different model, but the cost 
in computation is significant (roughly a factor of 300 more 
than using fixed segmentations). Since we have found the 
stochastic segment model performance to be fairly sensitive 
to boundary location, we anticipate that optimal segmen- 
tation may be very important. A compromise strategy is 
to find the optimal segmentation subject to the constraint 
of being within a fixed number of frames of the HMM seg- 
mentation. The constrained dynamic programming solution 
appears to suffer no loss in performance and saves a factor of 
30 in computation relative to the unconstrained algorithm. 
A slight variation of the segmentation algorithm involves 
searching for the optimal phone sequence and its segmen- 
tation, given a word sequence. In other words, we allow 
alternative pronunciations in rescoring a sentence hypothe- 
sis. We hypothesize that the use of alternative pronuncia- 
tions will significantly improve SSM word recognition per- 
formance, mainly because SSM phoneme recognition perfor- 
mance is much higher on the carefully hand-labeled TIMIT 
database than it is on the Resource Management Task (in 
which case we assume that the phone sequence assigned 
by the BBN single pronunciation recognizer is "correct"). 
However, we have not investigated this question on a dic- 
tionary with a sufficiently rich set of pronunciations. The 
additional cost of modeling multiple pronunciations should 
be relatively small. 
Combin ing  Scores  
An important issue is how to combine the scores from 
the systems o as to optimize the performance of the overall 
system. In this initial work, we chose to use a linear combi- 
nation of HMM log acoustic score, log grammar score, num- 
ber of words in the sentence (insertion penalty), number of 
phonemes in the sentence, and SSM log acoustic score. This 
is a simple extension of the current HMM system ranking, 
which uses the first three of these five measures. 
We estimate the set of weights that optimizes a general- 
ized mean of the rank of the correct answer: 
s 
1 re(S) = I'~ ~ r(i)~l ~" (1) 
i=1 
where r(i) is the rank of the correct answer in sentence i of 
a set S of S sentences, and p determines the type of mean. 
For example, p = 1 specifies the average, p -- 2 specifies 
the root-mean-square, p ---- -1  specifies the harmonic mean, 
and p = -oo  only counts the percent correct. For speech 
recognition applications p = -oo  would be appropriate, but 
for speech understanding applications, p = 1 might be more 
useful. In practice we find that the different values of p did 
not have a significant impact on the results. 
Estimation of the weights is an unconstrained multi- 
dimensional minimization problem. The algorithm used 
here is Powell's method \[10\], which iteratively minimizes the 
generalized mean (Equation 1) by optimizing the weights 
in successive conjugate directions. Because the algorithm 
seemed to be sensitive to local optima, we determine the 
weights by trying several different initial points. This strat- 
egy gave an increase in performance. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The recognition experiments were based on the Resource 
Management (RM) corpus. Both the BBN Byblos system 
and the BU stochastic segment models were trained on 
the speaker-independent SI109 corpus. Both systems used 
84  
feature vectors comprised of 14 reel-warped cepstral coeffi- 
cients and the respective derivatives; the BBN system also 
used power and second derivatives of the cepstra. 
The basic BBN Byblos system is essentially the same as 
originally described in \[2\]. These experiments u ed context- 
dependent but not cross-word triphone models. The mod- 
els are gender-dependent; the system scores a sentence with 
both male and female models and then chooses the answer 
that gives the highest score. With few exceptions, the cor- 
rect speaker sex is chosen. The Byblos system was used 
to generate the top 20 sentence hypotheses for each utter- 
ance. Experiments with larger numbers of hypotheses sug- 
gested that the additional rescoring computation was not 
warranted. This was due to the fact that, using the HMM 
models, the correct sentence was almost always included 
within the top 20 hypotheses. 
Two different SSM systems were used to rescore these 
hypotheses: one context-independent a d one using left- 
context phone models. In both cases gender-dependent 
models are used, where the speaker sex was that chosen 
by the BBN system. The model structure from the best 
case system found in previous tudies \[5\] was used. This 
system is based on independent samples, frame-dependent 
feature transformations, and five distributions per model. 
Infrequently observed classes are modeled with a frame- 
dependent, model-independent tied covariance matrix, oth- 
erwise a model- and frame-dependent dovariance matrix is 
used. Using more sophisticated estimation techniques, as 
well as generalized triphones \[8\], would likely yield signifi- 
cant improvements for context-dependent models. In addi- 
tion, recent work in time correlation modeling \[7\] could be 
used to improve performance, and this will be integrated 
into a later version of the system. 
Results for two different est sets are described below. 
First, we investigated different score combinations on the 
February 1989 RM test set. Second, we report results on the 
February 1991 RM benchmark test set, where the previous 
test set is used to estimate weights for combining the scores.

In the first set of experiments, the N-best hypotheses 
were generated using the Byblos system with a fully-connected' 
statistical bi-class grammar \[4\]. In this experiment, we used 
a grammar with 548 classes that had a perplexity of 23 on 
the test set. This system finds the correct sentence in the 
top 20 hypotheses 98% of the time. These sentences were 
rescored using the two different stochastic segment models. 
For each sentence hypothesis, the total score included the 
log HMM acoustic score and/or the log SSM acoustic score 
(either context-independent or context-dependent). In ad- 
dition, all score combinations included log grammar scores, 
word and phoneme count. The weights for different combi- 
nations of scores were designed as described in the previous

section, using the generalized mean optimization criterion 
with p = -1.  Table 1 summarizes the performance of sev- 
eral different system combinations. 
The table shows improved performance for more com- 
plex versions of the stochastic segment model. Using the 
fixed segmentations yields significantly lower performance 
for the segment model, so all further experiments use the 
constrained optimal segmentation. The simple left-context 
model results in improved performance over the context- 
independent model, both alone and in combination with 
the HMM. The HMM which uses triphone models outper- 
forms the SSM which uses left-context models; but the per- 
formance of the two systems is close in comparing percent 
sentence correct in the top N for N > 4 (see Figure 1). 
Table 1 also shows the improvement associated with the 
rescoring formalism. First, since the N-best search algo- 
rithm is sub-optimal, simply rescoring the hypotheses with 
the original ttMM (referred to in the table and figure as 
an "optimized HMM") yields some improvement in perfor- 
mance. More importantly, the results how that even at the 
lower level of performance of the SSM, combining the HMM 
and SSM scores yields improvement in performance, par- 
ticularly through raising the rank of the correct sentence. 
This is shown more clearly in Figure 1, which illustrates 
the cumulative distribution function of percent of sentences 
correct in the top N hypotheses. 
As mentioned previously, this is a preliminary result, so 
we expect additional improvement - both for the SSM alone 
and the combined systems - from further research in SSM 
context modeling. 
Benchmark  Resu l ts  
A second experiment involved testing performance of the 
scoring combinations on the February 91 benchmark test 
set. In this case, the 20 best sentence hypotheses were gen- 
erated using the word-pair grammar. These sentences were

restored using the context-independent SSM with the con- 
strained optimal segmentation algorithm. The scores used 
were log HMM and SSM scores and word and phoneme 
counts; no grammar scores were used in this experiment. 
Weights were trained using the February 1989 test set. Al- 
though p = --oo would be appropriate for this task, we used 
p = -1  because of the sensitivity of the search to local op- 
tima. In Table 2, we show benchmark test results for differ- 
ent combinations of HMM and SSM, with performance on 
the February 1989 test set given for comparison. For each 
case, we give the percent of the sentences recognized cor- 
rectly as the top choice and the average rank of the correct 
answer when it is in the top 20..The HMM results reported 
here may be lower than other results reported in this pro- 
ceedings, since we are using a simpler version of the Byblos 
system (specifically without cross-word phonetic models). 
As before, we find that the context-dependent HMM is out- 
performing the context-independent SSM, and that rescor- 
ing yields a small improvement in performance, mainly in 
average sentence rank. 
DISCUSSION 
In summary, we have introduced a new formalism for in- 
tegrating different speech recognition technologies based on 
generating the N best sentence hypotheses with one system, 
rescoring these hypotheses, and combining the scores of the 
different systems. This N-best rescoring formalism can be 
useful in several ways. 
Specifically, it makes practical the implementation of a 
computationally expensive system such as the Stochastic 
Segment Model, and has allowed us to investigate the util- 
ity of the SSM for word recognition. The results reported 
here are the first reported on the Resource Management

task for the SSM. Our initial results were much lower than 
would be predicted from phoneme recognition results on 
the TIMIT database, underscoring the need for additional 
system development. The rescoring formalism will facih- 
tare further research in SSM word recognition, particularly 
in the utilization of recent techniques developed for time 
correlation modeling and context modeling. Research in 
context-modeling is particularly facilitated by the rescoring 
formalism, since the computation time is the same order of 
magnitude as context-independent models. 
More generally, the rescoring formalism enables cross- 
site collaboration and fast evaluation of potential improve- 
ments in speech understanding associated with integration 
of different knowledge sources. It provides a simple mech- 
anism for integrating even radically different recognition 
technologies, enabling higher performance than either tech- 
86  
nique alone. The results reported here yield some improve- 
ment in performance, but we anticipate a greater effect with 
future improvements o the SSM. Improvements can also 
be gained from further research on score combination, since 
the weight estimation technique was found to be very sensi- 
tive to initial starting points. In addition, scores from very 
different ypes of knowledge sources could be combined to 
improve the performance of a speech understanding system. 
For example, if scores are combined after natural anguage 
processing, it would be possible to include a score which 
represents the prosodic consistency of a parse \[14\]. This is 
one of many possible areas for future research.
