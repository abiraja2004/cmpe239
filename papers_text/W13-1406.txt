Abstract
T.S. Eliot?s modernist poem The Waste Land is
often interpreted as collection of voices which
appear multiple times throughout the text. Here,
we investigate whether we can automatically
cluster existing segmentations of the text into
coherent, expert-identified characters. We show
that clustering The Waste Land is a fairly dif-
ficult task, though we can do much better than
random baselines, particularly if we begin with
a good initial segmentation.
1 Introduction
Although literary texts are typically written by a sin-
gle author, the style of a work of literature is not nec-
essarily uniform. When a certain character speaks,
for instance, an author may shift styles to give the
character a distinct voice. Typically, voice switches
in literature are explicitly marked, either by the use
of quotation marks with or without a said quota-
tive, or, in cases of narrator switches, by a major
textual boundary (e.g. the novel Ulysses by James
Joyce). However, implicit marking is the norm in
some modernist literature: a well-known example is
the poem The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, which is
usually analyzed in terms of voices that each appear
multiple times throughout the text. Our interest is
distinguishing these voices automatically.
One of the poem?s most distinctive voices is that
of the woman who speaks at the end of its second
section:
I can?t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
It?s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said
[158?159]
Her chatty tone and colloquial grammar and lexis
distinguish her voice from many others in the poem,
such as the formal and traditionally poetic voice of a
narrator that recurs many times in the poem:
Above the antique mantel was displayed
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
The change of Philomel
[97?99]
Although the stylistic contrasts between these and
other voices are clear to many readers, Eliot does
not explicitly mark the transitions, nor is it obvi-
ous when a voice has reappeared. Our previous
work focused on only the segmentation part of the
voice identification task (Brooke et al, 2012). Here,
we instead assume an initial segmentation and then
try to create clusters corresponding to segments of
the The Waste Land which are spoken by the same
voice. Of particular interest is the influence of the
initial segmentation on the success of this down-
stream task.
2 Related Work
There is a small body of work applying quantita-
tive methods to poetry: Simonton (1990) looked
at lexical and semantic diversity in Shakespearean
sonnets and correlated this with aesthetic success,
whereas Dugan (1973) developed statistics of for-
mulaic style and applied them to the Chanson de
Roland to determine whether it represents an oral
or written style. Kao and Jurafsky (2012) quantify
various aspects of poety, including style and senti-
ment, and use these features to distinguish profes-
sional and amateur writers of contemporary poetry.
41
With respect to novels, the work of McKenna and
Antonia (2001) is very relevant; they used principal
components analysis of lexical frequency to discrim-
inate different voices and narrative styles in sections
of Ulysses by James Joyce.
Clustering techniques have been applied to liter-
ature in general; for instance, Luyckx (2006) clus-
tered novels according to style, and recent work in
distinguishing two authors of sections of the Bible
(Koppel et al, 2011) relies crucially on an initial
clustering which is bootstrapped into a supervised
classifier which is applied to segments. Beyond lit-
erature, the tasks of stylistic inconsistency detec-
tion (Graham et al, 2005; Guthrie, 2008) and intrin-
sic (unsupervised) plagiarism detection (Stein et al,
2011) are very closely related to our interests here,
though in such tasks usually only two authors are
posited; more general kinds of authorship identifi-
cation (Stamatatos, 2009) may include many more
authors, though some form of supervision (i.e. train-
ing data) is usually assumed.
Our work here is built on our earlier work (Brooke
et al, 2012). Our segmentation model for The Waste
Land was based on a stylistic change curve whose
values are the distance between stylistic feature vec-
tors derived from 50 token spans on either side of
each point (spaces between tokens) in the text; the
local maxima of this curve represent likely voice
switches. Performance on The Waste Land was far
from perfect, but evaluation using standard text seg-
mentation metrics (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) indi-
cated that it was well above various baselines.
3 Method
Our approach to voice identification in The Waste
Land consists first of identifying the boundaries of
voice spans (Brooke et al, 2012). Given a segmenta-
tion of the text, we consider each span as a data point
in a clustering problem. The elements of the vector
correspond to the best feature set from the segmen-
tation task, with the rationale that features which
were useful for detecting changes in style should
also be useful for identifying stylistic similarities.
Our features therefore include: a collection of read-
ability metrics (including word length), frequency
of punctuation, line breaks, and various parts-of-
speech, lexical density, average frequency in a large
external corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006), lexicon-
based sentiment metrics using SentiWordNet (Bac-
cianella et al, 2010), formality score (Brooke et al,
2010), and, perhaps most notably, the centroid of 20-
dimensional distributional vectors built using latent
semantic analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), re-
flecting the use of words in a large web corpus (Bur-
ton et al, 2009); in previous work (Brooke et al,
2010), we established that such vectors contain use-
ful stylistic information about the English lexicon
(including rare words that appear only occasionally
in such a corpus), and indeed LSA vectors were the
single most promising feature type for segmentation.
For a more detailed discussion of the feature set, see
Brooke et al (2012). All the features are normalized
to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.
For clustering, we use a slightly modified ver-
sion of the popular k-means algorithm (MacQueen,
1967). Briefly, k-means assigns points to a cluster
based on their proximity to the k cluster centroids,
which are initialized to randomly chosen points from
the data and then iteratively refined until conver-
gence, which in our case was defined as a change of
less than 0.0001 in the position of each centroid dur-
ing one iteration.1 Our version of k-means is distinct
in two ways: first, it uses a weighted centroid where
the influence of each point is based on the token
length of the underlying span, i.e. short (unreliable)
spans which fall into the range of some centroid will
have less effect on the location of the centroid than
larger spans. Second, we use a city-block (L1) dis-
tance function rather than standard Euclidean (L2)
distance function; in the segmentation task, Brooke
et al found that city-block (L1) distance was pre-
ferred, a result which is in line with other work
in stylistic inconsistency detection (Guthrie, 2008).
Though it would be interesting to see if a good k
could be estimated independently, for our purposes
here we set k to be the known number of speakers in
our gold standard.
4 Evaluation
We evaluate our clusters by comparing them to a
gold standard annotation. There are various met-
rics for extrinsic cluster evaluation; Amigo? et al
1Occasionally, there was no convergence, at which point we
halted the process arbitrarily after 100 iterations.
42
(2009) review various options and select the BCubed
precision and recall metrics (Bagga and Baldwin,
1998) as having all of a set of key desirable prop-
erties. BCubed precision is a calculation of the frac-
tion of item pairs in the same cluster which are also
in the same category, whereas BCubed recall is the
fraction of item pairs in the same category which
are also in the same cluster. The harmonic mean
of these two metrics is BCubed F-score. Typically,
the ?items? are exactly what has been clustered, but
this is problematic in our case, because we wish to
compare methods which have different segmenta-
tions and thus the vectors that are being clustered
are not directly comparable. Instead, we calculate
the BCubed measures at the level of the token; that
is, for the purposes of measuring performance we
act as if we had clustered each token individually,
instead of the spans of tokens actually used.
Our first evaluation is against a set of 20
artificially-generated ?poems? which are actually
randomly generated combinations of parts of 12 po-
ems which were chosen (by an English literature ex-
pert, one of the authors) to represent the time period
and influences of The Waste Land. The longest of
these poems is 1291 tokens and the shortest is just
90 tokens (though 10 of the 12 have at least 300 to-
kens); the average length is 501 tokens. Our method
for creating these poems is similar to that of Kop-
pel et al (2011), though generalized for multiple
authors. For each of the artificial poems, we ran-
domly selected 6 poems from the 12 source poems,
and then we concatenated 100-200 tokens (or all the
remaining tokens, if less than the number selected)
from each of these 6 poems to the new combined
poem until all the poems were exhausted or below
our minimum span length (20 tokens). This allows
us to evaluate our method in ideal circumstances, i.e.
when there are very distinct voices corresponding to
different poets, and the voice spans tend to be fairly
long.
Our gold standard annotation of The Waste Land
speakers is far more tentative. It is based on a
number of sources: our own English literature ex-
pert, relevant literary analysis (Cooper, 1987), and
also The Waste Land app (Touch Press LLP, 2011),
which includes readings of the poem by various ex-
perts, including T.S. Eliot himself. However, there
is inherently a great deal of subjectivity involved in
literary annotation and, indeed, one of the potential
benefits of our work is to find independent justifi-
cation for a particular voice annotation. Our gold
standard thus represents just one potential interpre-
tation of the poem, rather than a true, unique gold
standard. The average size of the 69 segments in
the gold standard is 50 tokens; the range, however,
is fairly wide: the longest is 373 tokens, while the
shortest consists of a single token. Our annotation
has 13 voices altogether.
We consider three segmentations: the segmen-
tation of our gold standard (Gold), the segmenta-
tion predicted by our segmentation model (Auto-
matic), and a segmentation which consists of equal-
length spans (Even), with the same number of spans
as in the gold standard. The Even segmentation
should be viewed as the baseline for segmentation,
and the Gold segmentation an ?oracle? represent-
ing an upper bound on segmentation performance.
For the automatic segmentation model, we use the
settings from Brooke et al (2012). We also com-
pare three possible clusterings for each segmenta-
tion: no clustering at all (Initial), that is, we assume
that each segment is a new voice; k-means clustering
(k-means), as outlined above; and random clustering
(Random), in which we randomly assign each voice
to a cluster. For these latter two methods, which both
have a random component, we averaged our metrics
over 50 runs. Random and Initial are here, of course,
to provide baselines for judging the effectiveness of
k-means clustering model. Finally, when using the
gold standard segmentation and k-means clustering,
we included another oracle option (Seeded): instead
of the standard k-means method of randomly choos-
ing them from the available datapoints, each cen-
troid is initialized to the longest instance of a dif-
ferent voice, essentially seeding each cluster.
5 Results
Table 1 contains the results for our first evaluation
of voice clustering, the automatically-generated po-
ems. In all the conditions, using the gold segmen-
tation far outstrips the other two options. The au-
tomatic segmentation is consistently better than the
evenly-spaced baseline, but the performance is actu-
ally worse than expected; the segmentation metrics
we used in our earlier work

The results for The Waste Land are in Table 2.
Many of the basic patterns are the same, including
the consistent ranking of the methods; overall, how-
ever, the clustering is far less effective. This is par-
ticularly true for the gold-standard condition, which
only increases modestly between the initial and clus-
tered state; the marked increase in recall is balanced
by a major loss of precision. In fact, unlike with
the artificial text, the most promising aspect of the
clustering seems to be the fairly sizable boost to the
quality of clusters in automatic segmenting perfor-
mance. The effect of seeding is also very consistent,
nearly as effective as in the automatic case.
We also looked at the results for individual speak-
ers in The Waste Land; many of the speakers (some
of which appear only in a few lines) are very poorly
distinguished, even with the gold-standard segmen-
tation and seeding, but there are a few that cluster
quite well; the best two are in fact our examples from
Section 1,2 that is, the narrator (F-score 0.869), and
the chatty woman (F-score 0.605). The former re-
sult is particularly important, from the perspective
of literary analysis, since there are several passages
which seem to be the main narrator (and our ex-
pert annotated them as such) but which are definitely
open to interpretation.
6 Conclusion
Literature, by its very nature, involves combin-
ing existing means of expression in surprising new
ways, resisting supervised analysis methods that de-
pend on assumptions of conformity. Our unsuper-
vised approach to distinguishing voices in poetry of-
fers this necessary flexibility, and indeed seems to
work reasonably well in cases when the stylistic dif-
ferences are clear. The Waste Land, however, is a
very subtle text, and our results suggest that we are
a long way from something that would be a consid-
ered a possible human interpretation. Nevertheless,
applying quantitative methods to these kinds of texts
can, for literary scholars, bridge the gab between
abstract interpretations and the details of form and
function (McKenna and Antonia, 2001). In our own
case, this computational work is just one aspect of
a larger project in literary analysis where the ulti-
mate goal is not to mimic human behavior per se,
but rather to better understand literary phenomena
by annotation and modelling of these phenomena
(Hammond, 2013; Hammond et al, 2013).
With respect to future enhancements, improving
segmentation is obviously important; the best au-
tomated efforts so far provide only a small boost
over a baseline approach to segmentation. However,
independently of this, our experiments with gold-
standard seeding suggest that refining our approach
to clustering, e.g. a method that identifies good ini-
tial points for our centroids, may also pay dividends
in the long run. A more radical idea for future work
would be to remove the somewhat artificial delim-
2These passages are the original examples from our earlier
work (Brooke et al, 2012), selected by our expert for their dis-
tinctness, so the fact that they turned out to be the most easily
clustered is actually a result of sorts (albeit an anecdotal one),
suggesting that our clustering behavior does correspond some-
what to a human judgment of distinctness.

itation of the task into segmentation and clustering
phases, building a model which works iteratively
to produce segments that are sensitive to points of
stylistic change but that, at a higher level, also form
good clusters (as measured by intrinsic measures of
cluster quality).
