Abstract
In this paper, we present an in depth revi-
sion of the preliminary version of PrepNet,
an lexical semantics database of preposition
behaviors. This revision includes a much
more detailed structure for the language re-
alization level.
1 Aims
Describing the syntax and the semantics of prepo-
sitions, in a way similar to verbs (e.g. in
FrameNet (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ framenet/), or
VerbNet (www.cis.upenn.edu/verbnet/)) or to nouns
(as in WordNet and EuroWordNet) is obviously
a very challenging, but necessary task. Preposi-
tions turn out to be a very useful category in a
number of applications such as indexing, knowl-
edge extraction, textual entailment and question
answering since they convey basic meanings of
much interest like instruments, means, comparisons,
amounts, approximations, localizations, etc. They
must necessarily be taken into account?and ren-
dered accurately?for effective machine translation
and lexical choice in language generation. However,
so far, prepositions have not been studied in NLP
circles as extensively as nouns and verbs.
PrepNet (http://www.irit.fr/recherches/ILPL/Site-
Equipe/ILPL.htm under revision) is a framework
that aims at constructing a repository of preposition
syntactic and semantic behaviors. PrepNet is struc-
tured in two levels:
 the abstract notion level: global, language inde-
pendent, characterization of preposition senses
in an abstract way, where frames represent
some generic semantic aspects of these notions,
 the language realization levels that deal with re-
alizations for various languages, using a variety
of marks (postpositions, affixes, compounds,
etc.). However, we will keep the term ?preposi-
tion? hereafter for all these marks.
We present here a revised version of a preliminary
PrepNet. Besides some simplifications of the struc-
ture, innovations mainly concern the structures pro-
vided at the language realization level, motivated by
the study of a few notions for a variety of languages.
We provide the means to describe syntactic subcate-
gorization forms, as well as semantic and pragmatic
restrictions on uses. It seems that our view is now
usable in a number of languages, but some are still
resistant, like, e.g. Malay.
2 Related work
There is quite a lot of literature on prepositions in
psycholinguistics circles, and some in AI and in
cognitive sciences (Horno Cheliz, 82), (Cervioni,
91), (Lindstomberg 97), (Mari, 00), (Pesetzky, 82),
(Talmy 76, 85), but less in NLP (Saint-Dizier, 06).
A quite old, but still of interest work (Spark-Jones
et al 85) proposes, via cases or roles, a structure for
prepositions, and their relations to verbs.
The basis and the starting point of our research
was developed about 10 years ago by Bonnie Dorr,
it is accessible at:
www.umiacs.umd.edu/?bonnie/
AZ-preps-English.lcs.
This is a very large database of preposition semantic
763
representations, characterized by their LCS repre-
sentation and, sometimes, by a thematic grid. It
was concieved for machine translation tasks, which
explains some of its features. There are about 500
entries (compared to our 165 abstract notions),
for probably all English prepositions. Finally, the
Preposition Project offers a lexicographic view of
prepositions in English.
3 Main features of PrepNet
Within the PrepNet framework, we have identified
so far 195 preposition senses (which may have sub-
senses in particular languages), which can be repre-
sented in the Lexical Conceptual Structure frame-
work on the basis of 65 primitives, based on En-
glish preposition names (on, near, with, etc.). These
senses reflect the variety of primitive notions con-
veyed by prepositions. Abstract notion representa-
tions may be a composition of several primitives.
Primitives are viewed here as linguistic macros,
which can then be interpreted depending on the envi-
ronment (e.g. Euclidean geometry for spatial prepo-
sitions, fuzzy logic axioms for the notion of approx-
imation).
To elaborate an adequate formalism for the syn-
tactic and semantic aspects of prepositions we want
to encode in PrepNet, we have studied in depth
preposition realizations in language around the ab-
stract notions of theme and approximation (French,
Spanish, Catalan, English, Thai) and instruments
(for German, Italian, Spanish, French, Arabic and
Berber, Thai, Bahasa Malaysia, Hindi, Urdu, Kash-
miri, Bengali, and Filipino). This latter notion is
much wider than the first two, and has a large variety
of realization parameters, which greatly contributed
to this second version of PrepNet. A multilingual
analysis needs to be somewhat transcategorial and
both syntactic and semantic.
4 Preposition usage characterizations
using Frames
4.1 General overview of abstract notions
In PrepNet, preposition senses are characterized by
means of abstract notions which capture senses in
a conceptual and language independent way. These
abstract notions have been defined from corpus anal-
ysis and bilingual dictionaries (in particular the
German-French Harrap?s, which has an excellent
conceptual approach to translation). From corpora,
focussing on French, Spanish and English, we have
studied every preposition lexeme, its distributions
and constraints, and we have identified manually
the different meanings they convey. We have then
formed groups of senses out of which the abstract
notions emerged. This took about 1.5 man/year
of work, preposition being not as numerous as e.g.
verbs or adjectives (about 50 to 100).
The first level, the abstract notions, is organized
as follows:
- a first level characterizes a semantic family, of a
level roughly comparable to thematic roles: local-
ization, manner, quantity, accompaniment, etc.,
- a second level accounts for the different facets of
a semantic family, e.g. source, destination, via, and
fixed position for the localization family,
- a third level characterizes, roughly speaking, the
modalities of a facet when appropriate. For exam-
ple, the facet manner and attitudes is decomposed
into 3 modalities: basic manner, manner by com-
parison and manner with a reference point. Due to
space limitations, this latter level will not be much
developed here.
Abstract notions are the following (revised from
(Saint-Dizier, 05)):
 Localization with facets:
- source, - destination, - via/passage, - fixed
position.
From an ontological point of view, all of theses
facets can, a priori, apply to spatial, temporal
or to more abstract arguments.
 Quantity with facets:
- numerical or referential quantity, - fre-
quency and iterativity, - proportion or ratio.
 Manner with facets:
- manners and attitudes, - means (instru-
ment or abstract), - imitation, agreement or
analogy.
Imitation: he walks like a robot; agreement: he
behaves according to the law,
 Accompaniment with facets:
- adjunction, - simultaneity of events (co-
events), - inclusion, - exclusion.
764
Adjunction : flat with terrace / steak with
French fries / tea with milk, Exclusion: they all
came except Paul.
 Choice and exchange with facets:
- exchange, - choice or alternative, - substi-
tution.
Substitution : sign for your child, Choice:
among all my friends, he is the funniest one.
 Causality with facets :
- cause, - goal or consequence, - intention -
purpose.
Cause: the rock fell under the action of frost.
 Opposition with two ontological distinctions:
physical opposition and psychological or epis-
temic opposition, e.g.: to act contrary to one?s
interests.
 Ordering with facets:
- priority, - subordination, - hierarchy, -
ranking, - degree of importance.
Ranking : at school, she is ahead of me.
 Instrument (see below),
 Other groups: - Theme, - in spite of, - com-
parison.
Theme: a book concerning dinosaurs.
4.2 Representation of abstract notions
An abstract notion is characterized by:
1. a name and a gloss, that informally describe
the abstract notion at stake,
2. a conceptual representation, in simplified
LCS form,
3. inferential patterns and presuppositions,
which will not be developed here.
4.3 Representation of the language level
While we have a unique, language independent,
structure for abstract notions, we have a set of de-
scriptions for each language. At this level, we may
also have semantic subdivisions whenever relevant,
called strata. Let us study here the direct usages,
i.e. those which are not a priori metaphorical or
in any other form of meaning shift. Our approach,
however, integrates the possibility to describe these
shifts either directly or via rules.
The language level descriptions include at the mo-
ment the following features:
 syntactic frames: the syntactic subcategoriza-
tion frames the preposition heads (possibly
in conjunction with other predicates like a
verb), with some statistics on usage frequency.
Frames are a little bit complex since they need
to take into account (1) elements not com-
pletely headed by the preposition but which
nevertheless play a major role (the verb and the
?external argument? of the preposition) and (2)
the structure the preposition heads (in general
an NP, possibly an S). This is realized by cor-
pus inspection. In addition, alternations prepo-
sitions may undergo are given and some gram-
matical movements (such as fronting).
 semantic and domain restrictions: each argu-
ment in the frame may have selectional restric-
tions. These allow us to identify different lan-
guage realizations. Restrictions may also be re-
lated to domains and not to arguments.
 pragmatic aspects: prepositions convey a num-
ber of pragmatic factors such as: stress (iden-
tifying a new focus), polarity, illocutionary
force, formal character, etc. These are mainly
given to restrict usages.
4.4 Basic case: the VIA notion
The facet VIA of the ?localisation? family describes
a movement via a passage. The abstract notion
frame is defined as follows:
VIA
?An entity X moving via a location Y?
representation: X : via(loc, Y)
This frame reads as follows: after the name and
the gloss of the notion, we find a simple, LCS-based,
semantic representation where X is the external ar-
gument, and loc specifies the domain: localization
(other cases are assumed to be derived by metaphor).
Let us now consider the language level. In
French, the by-default associated synset is {par,
via} . X and Y are restricted respectively to concrete
entities and location, the verb is restricted to inher-
ently directed motion (in B. Levin?s terminology),
as in:
765
passer par la porte, transiter par la Belgique,
Paris-Strasbourg via Nancy.
Syntactic frames examples are (given informally, in
readable format):
[X(np,subj), Verb, Y(np,obj,optional),
preposition, Z(np,obj2)],
[Y(compound NP, +loc), preposition, Z(np, +loc)], etc.
Next, we also have a specific case (a strata) where
the passage is narrow. In that case, the synset is
{a` travers, au travers de, dans}, and Verbs are ei-
ther inherently directed motion or perception verbs
(regarder dans le te?le?scope, regarder a` travers la
grille).
4.5 Compound forms: via under
The abstract notion VIA has a few strata that
correspond to compound notions that express a
more precise trajectory like via under, via above.
For example, in French, to express this notion, the
preposition par is combined with a fixed location
preposition such as dessous, dessus etc. to form
compounds such as: par dessus, par dessous (via
under, via above). The frame structure remains the
same, except that the semantic representation has
then an embedded functional structure:
VIA UNDER
?An entity moving via under a location?
representation: X : via(loc, under(loc,Y))
At the language realization level, the French
synset is: {par dessous }.
5 A more complex case: dealing with
instruments
The study of the abstract notion of instrumentality,
as reported in (Kawtrakul et ali, 06), has led us to
revise and largely improve the language level for-
malism. Let us report here some of its main facets.
In this work, 12 languages from 5 linguistic families
are studied: Thai, Malay, Hindi, Urdu, Kashmiri,
Bengali, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic
and Berber. Filipino has been recently considered.
Besides basic syntactic frames, of much interest
is that most of these languages use other forms than
?prepositions? to realize these abstract notions: post-
positions, various kinds of affixes, verb compounds,
etc. A number of the languages studied have an in-
strumental case.
Our investigations tend to show that we can have
on the one hand a stable abstract frame that repre-
sents the semantic and some pragmatic aspects of
the abstract notion and, on the other hand, at the
language realization level, a description of the be-
haviors of ?prepositions? in the various languages.
We do not establish any direct connection between
two preposition realizations in two languages. The
relation, in terms of translation, is established via
the set of restrictions imposed on each lexicalization
that corresponds the best to the restrictions imposed
on the argument Y. The impact of the other elements
(arguments and verb) remains to be explored. Each
language has an independent description.
5.1 Representing the abstract notion
The generic frame for instruments is as follows:
INSTRUMENT
?An actor X uses an object Z (the instrument)
to reach a goal E?
X, Y : by_means_of(E, Z)
In this frame, an event E is introduced to refer to
the goal, e. g. ?cut bread? as in John cuts bread
with a knife. Note also that in the semantic represen-
tation, the instrumental expression has wider scope
over the event: this reflects the fact that most ad-
juncts have scope over propositions (predicate and
its arguments).
In terms of restrictions, a major difficulty is the
prototypicality of instruments. At a conceptual
level, it is quite difficult to characterize what is a pro-
totypical instrument for a given action. Each event
has its own prototypical instrument, making corpus
studies extremely large, probably unfeasable. For
the time being, we leave the type of the instrument
largely open. However, at the language realization
level, we may have some useful restrictions, as will
be seen below.
5.2 Dealing with language realizations
Let us now present a variety of language realizations
that motivated the different facets of the formalism
we have developed. In each case, we have a by-
default synset of marks, and more restricted sets of
marks for specific cases, related in particular to the
semantic type of the instrument, but also to prag-
matic effects or domains of discourse.
The different language variations presented be-
low have been elaborated in several steps via cor-
766
pus and dictionaries. A first set of utterances was
collected by using the various prepositions in each
language and by analyzing the usage restrictions ob-
served. Then we constructed a second set of utter-
ances to confirm the analysis, by attempting to find
counter examples. Counter examples always exist,
but they must remain marginal for the analysis to
be confirmed. Analysis was done independently for
each language in order to avoid any influence. Much
more data can be found in (Kawtrakul et ali, 06).
Let us now present language realization levels for
a few quite diverse languages.
French by-default synset: [avec, par, au
moyen de, gra?ce a`, a` l?aide de, a`
travers].
some syntactic structures:
[X(subj) Verb(action) Y(obj) preposition
Z(np or S)], [?utiliser? Z ?pour?
Verb(action, infinitive) Y], etc. .
More informally, other syntactic properties are:
the instrument is in general an adjunct to the VP,
it therefore has the properties of such types of ad-
juncts. It undergoes the alternation: ?Characteristic
property of instrument? (Levin 86) and a few other
movements, e.g.: fronting. Finally, it cannot be
inserted between the verb and the object.
Usage restrictions: introduces a focus on the in-
strument (in particular to focus on non prototypical
instruments): au moyen de.
polarity: positive: gra?ce a`
German by-default synset: [mit, mit
Hilfe von, mittels, durch, anhand,
kraft, dank, per.]
Of interest here are the domain and pragmatic
restrictions on preposition usages, e.g.:
domain: juridical, psychological: kraft,
anhand
formal usage: mittels
focus: mittels, mit Hilfe von
instrumental manner: durch.
Hindi by-default synset: [se, me, ke
karaan, ke dwaraa, kar, karaan,
dwara]
the syntactic frame encodes here postpositions,
case marks and the SOV form: [X(subject,
ergative), Y(object, accusative),
Z(adjunct), postposition, Verb(action)].
This form is a priori very regular, Z is an NP or an
S. Y and Z can occasionally be permuted. Let us
note some interesting usage restrictions:
instrument type: concrete: se
instrument type: abstract: dwAra
instrument type: means of transportation: me
involvement of instrument: agentive: ke dwara,
causal ke karaan
instrumental path: me, se.
Concerning other Northern India languages, Urdu
has about the same distribution and distinctions,
while Kashmiri and most notably Bengali have some
more distinctions, with the use of a large number
of prefixes and suffixes, which are expressed in the
subcat frame by means of features. Thai is relatively
straightforward, prepositions may be even omitted.
Filipino is close to Malay and Indonesian in terms
of structure, except that it is basically a VSO lan-
guage. It has also a large number of marks to capture
the notion of preposition: [ng, kay, kina,
sa], as in:
Pinalo niya ang aso ng patpat (litt. hits he the dog
with a stick).
The syntaxtic structure is therefore: [Verb,
X(subj), Y(obj), preposition, Z].
So far, the formalism we have elaborated allows
us to encode syntactic frames, restrictions, case
marks, prefixes and suffixes as well as postpositions.
However, languages of the malayo-polynesian fam-
ily raise additional problems which are not so easy
to capture. Let us just, for the sake of illustration,
survey a few aspects here for Malay and Filipino.
Malay has three ways to introduce instruments:
preposition + NP, affixes and compounding. Affixed
words are built from stems which are instrumental
nouns, this allows for the construction of the equiv-
alent of PPs, based on the prototypical use of the
instrumental noun. The most common being: pre-
fixes: beR- (e.g. from kuda, horse, berkuda, on
horseback), meN- (e.g. from kunci, key, mengunci,
lock with key), prefix + suffix: meN- + -kan (e.g.
from paku, nail, memakukan, to fasten with nails),
and with suffix -i (e.g. from ubat, medicine, mengu-
bati, by means of medicine). At the moment, we feel
it may be confusing to add derivational morphology
considerations (with many restrictions) into syntac-
tic frames, probably an additional means would be
necessary.
767
Similarly, Filipino has also a large number of
marks that play the role of prepositions, one of
which is viewed as an anteposed particle, working
as a determiner.
6 Perspectives
Although we have stabilized semantic notions and
some formalisms for the representation of preposi-
tion behaviors over a number of languages, PrepNet
is still in a development stage. The descriptions over
various languages are huge tasks. Our method for
the future will be to proceed by notion and study
a variety of languages to have a better grasp at the
semantic distinctions and language realizations, as
we did for instruments. For each case, a dedicated
method is often required. Descriptions are encoded
in XML, so that data can be easily shared.
Although the study of prepositions is an interest-
ing topic in itself, it is of much interest to investigate
how this work can be integrated into larger frame-
works such as FrameNet or VerbNet, and this is one
of our major prospective.
FrameNet says little about prepositions, but it has
a few frames such as Accompaniment which are of
interest. The roles defined in FrameNet are more ac-
curate than the abstract notions of PrepNet, which
aims at a relatively generic description. Those roles
are related to a variety of situations which are not
necessarily introduced by prepositions. However, a
preliminary, exploratory, task could be to attempt to
classify FrameNet roles under the main abstract no-
tions of PrepNet.
VerbNet uses a quite detailed list of thematic roles
which have some similarities with the top nodes of
PrepNet abstract notions hiererachy. In a VerbNet
frame, the syntax slot could be enriched by prepo-
sition type (abstract notions) restrictions. Similarly,
predefined primitives such as location or direction
are really close to our semantic representations in
LCS, but they are used in a different manner. Prep-
Net has additional primitives to handle argument and
non argument structures (e.g. approximation).
