Abstract
Although traditionally seen as a language-
independent task, collocation extraction
relies nowadays more and more on the
linguistic preprocessing of texts (e.g.,
lemmatization, POS tagging, chunking or
parsing) prior to the application of sta-
tistical measures. This paper provides
a language-oriented review of the exist-
ing extraction work. It points out sev-
eral language-specific issues related to ex-
traction and proposes a strategy for cop-
ing with them. It then describes a hybrid
extraction system based on a multilingual
parser. Finally, it presents a case-study on
the performance of an association measure
across a number of languages.
1 Introduction
Collocations are understood in this paper as ?id-
iosyncratic syntagmatic combination of lexical
items? (Fontenelle, 1992, 222): heavy rain, light
breeze, great difficulty, grow steadily, meet re-
quirement, reach consensus, pay attention, ask a
question. Unlike idioms (kick the bucket, lend a
hand, pull someone?s leg), their meaning is fairly
transparent and easy to decode. Yet, differently
from the regular productions, (big house, cultural
activity, read a book), collocational expressions
are highly idiosyncratic, since the lexical items
a headword combines with in order to express
a given meaning is contingent upon that word
(Mel?c?uk, 2003).
This is apparent when comparing a colloca-
tion?s equivalents across different languages. The
English collocation ask a question translates as
poser une question in French (lit., ?put a question),
and as fare una domanda, hacer una pregunta in
Italian and Spanish (lit., to make a question).
As it has been pointed out by many researchers
(Cruse, 1986; Benson, 1990; McKeown and
Radev, 2000), collocations cannot be described
by means of general syntactic and semantic rules.
They are arbitrary and unpredictable, and there-
fore need to be memorized and used as such. They
constitute the so-called ?semi-finished products?
of language (Hausmann, 1985) or the ?islands of
reliability? (Lewis, 2000) on which the speakers
build their utterances.
2 Motivation
The key importance of collocations in text pro-
duction tasks such as machine translation and nat-
ural language generation has been stressed many
times. It has been equally shown that collocations
are useful in a range of other applications, such as
word sense disambiguation (Brown et al, 1991)
and parsing (Alshawi and Carter, 1994).
The NLP community fully acknowledged the
need for an appropriate treatment of multi-word
expressions in general (Sag et al, 2002). Collo-
cations are particularly important because of their
prevalence in language, regardless of the domain
or genre. According to Jackendoff (1997, 156)
and Mel?c?uk (1998, 24), collocations constitute
the bulk of a language?s lexicon.
The last decades have witnessed a considerable
development of collocation extraction techniques,
that concern both monolingual and (parallel) mul-
tilingual corpora.
We can mention here only part of this work:
(Berry-Rogghe, 1973; Church et al, 1989;
Smadja, 1993; Lin, 1998; Krenn and Evert, 2001)
for monolingual extraction, and (Kupiec, 1993;
Wu, 1994; Smadja et al, 1996; Kitamura and Mat-
40
sumoto, 1996; Melamed, 1997) for bilingual ex-
traction via alignment.
Traditionally, collocation extraction was con-
sidered a language-independent task. Since collo-
cations are recurrent, typical lexical combinations,
a wide range of statistical methods based on word
co-occurrence frequency have been heavily used
for detecting them in text corpora. Among the
most often used types of lexical association mea-
sures (henceforth AMs) we mention: statistical
hypothesis tests (e.g., binomial, Poisson, Fisher, z-
score, chi-squared, t-score, and log-likelihood ra-
tio tests), that measure the significance of the asso-
ciation between two words based on a contingency
table listing their joint and marginal frequency,
and Information-theoretic measures (Mutual In-
formation ? henceforth MI ? and its variants),
that quantity of ?information? shared by two ran-
dom variables. A detailed review of the statistical
methods employed in collocation extraction can be
found, for instance, in (Evert, 2004). A compre-
hensive list of AMs is given (Pecina, 2005).
Very often, in addition to the information on co-
occurrence frequency, language-specific informa-
tion is also integrated in a collocation extraction
system (as it will be seen in section 3):
- morphological information, in order to count
inflected word forms as instances of the same
base form. For instance, ask questions, asks
question, asked question are all instances of
the same word pair, ask - question;
- syntactic information, in order to recognize a
word pair even if subject to (complex) syntac-
tic transformations: ask multiple questions,
question asked, questions that one might ask.
The language-specific modules thus aim at cop-
ing with the problem of morphosyntactic varia-
tion, in order to improve the accuracy of frequency
information. This becomes truly important espe-
cially for free-word order and for high-inflection
languages, for which the token(form)-based fre-
quency figures become too skewed due to the high
lexical dispersion. Not only the data scattering
modify the frequency numbers used by AMs, but
it also alters the performance of AMs, if the the
probabilities in the contingency table become very
low.
Morphosyntactic information has in fact been
shown to significantly improve the extraction re-
sults (Breidt, 1993; Smadja, 1993; Zajac et al,
2003). Morphological tools such as lemmatizers
and POS taggers are being commonly used in ex-
traction systems; they are employed both for deal-
ing with text variation and for validating the can-
didate pairs: combinations of function words are
typically ruled out (Justeson and Katz, 1995), as
are the ungrammatical combinations in the sys-
tems that make use of parsers (Church and Hanks,
1990; Smadja, 1993; Basili et al, 1994; Lin, 1998;
Goldman et al, 2001; Seretan et al, 2004).
Given the motivations for performing a
linguistically-informed extraction ? which were
also put forth, among others, by Church and
Hanks (1990, 25), Smadja (1993, 151) and Heid
(1994) ? and given the recent development of
linguistic analysis tools, it seems plausible that the
linguistic structure will be more and more taken
into account by collocation extraction systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
section 3 we provide a language-oriented review
of the existing collocation extraction work. Then
we highlight, in section 4, a series of problems that
arise in the transfer of methodology to a new lan-
guage, and we propose a strategy for dealing with
them. Section 5 describes an extraction system,
and, finally, section 6 presents a case-study on the
collocations extracted for four languages, illustrat-
ing the cross-lingual variation in the performance
of a particular AM.
3 Overview of Extraction Work
3.1 English
As one might expect, the bulk of the collocation
extraction work concerns the English language:
(Choueka, 1988; Church et al, 1989; Church and
Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Justeson and Katz,
1995; Kjellmer, 1994; Sinclair, 1995; Lin, 1998),
among many others1.
Choueka?s method (1988) detects n-grams (ad-
jacent words) only, by simply computing the co-
occurrence frequency. Justeson and Katz (1995)
apply a POS-filter on the pairs they extract. As in
(Kjellmer, 1994), the AM they use is the simple
frequency.
Smadja (1993) employs the z-score in conjunc-
tion with several heuristics (e.g., the systematic
occurrence of two lexical items at the same dis-
tance in text) and extracts predicative collocations,
1E.g., (Frantzi et al, 2000; Pearce, 2001; Goldman et al,
2001; Zaiu Inkpen and Hirst, 2002; Dias, 2003; Seretan et al,
2004; Pecina, 2005), and the list can be continued.
41
rigid noun phrases and phrasal templates. He then
uses the a parser in order to validate the results.
The parsing is shown to lead to an increase in ac-
curacy from 40% to 80%.
(Church et al, 1989) and (Church and Hanks,
1990) use POS information and a parser to extract
verb-object pairs, which then they rank according
to the mutual information (MI) measure they in-
troduce.
Lin?s (1998) is also a hybrid approach that relies
on a dependency parser. The candidates extracted
are then ranked with MI.
3.2 German
German is the second most investigated language,
thanks to the early work of Breidt (1993) and,
more recently, to that of Krenn and Evert, such as
(Krenn and Evert, 2001; Evert and Krenn, 2001;
Evert, 2004) centered on evaluation.
Breidt uses MI and t-score and compares the
results accuracy when various parameters vary,
such as the window size, presence vs. absence
of lemmatization, corpus size, and presence vs.
absence of POS and syntactic information. She
focuses on N-V pairs2 and, despite the lack of
syntactic analysis tools at the time, by simulating
parsing she comes to the conclusion that ?Very
high precision rates, which are an indispensable
requirement for lexical acquisition, can only real-
istically be envisaged for German with parsed cor-
pora? (Breidt, 1993, 82).
Later, Krenn and Evert (2001) used a German
chunker to extract syntactic pairs such as P-N-V.
Their work put the basis of formal and system-
atic methods in collocation extraction evaluation.
Zinsmeister and Heid (2003; 2004) focused on
N-V and A-N-V combinations identified using a
stochastic parser. They applied machine learning
techniques in combination to the log-likelihood
measure (henceforth LL) for distinguishing trivial
compounds from lexicalized ones.
Finally, Wermter and Hahn (2004) identified
PP-V combinations using a POS tagger and a
chunker. They based their method on a linguistic
criterion (that of limited modifiability) and com-
pared their results with those obtained using the
t-score and LL tests.
2The following abbreviations are used in this paper: N -
noun, V - verb, A - adjective, Adv - adverb, Det - determiner,
Conj - conjunction, P - preposition.
3.3 French
Thanks to the outstanding work of Gross on
lexicon-grammar (1984), French is one of the
most studied languages in terms of distributional
and transformational potential of words. This
work has been carried out before the computer era
and the advent of corpus linguistics, while auto-
matic extraction was later performed, for instance,
in (Lafon, 1984; Daille, 1994; Bourigault, 1992;
Goldman et al, 2001).
Daille (1994) aimed at extracting compound
nouns, defined a priori by means of certain syn-
tactic patterns, like N-A, N-N, N-a`-N, N-de-N, N
P Det N. She used a lemmatizer and a POS-tagger
before applying a series of AMs, which she then
evaluated against a domain-specific terminology
dictionary and against a gold-standard manually
created from the extraction corpus.
Similarly, Bourigault (1992) extracted noun-
phrases from shallow-parsed text, and Goldman et
al. (2001) extracted syntactic collocations by us-
ing a full parser and applying the LL test.
3.4 Other Languages
In addition to English, German and French, other
languages for which notable collocation extraction
work was performed, are ? as we are aware of ?
the following:
? Italian: early extraction work was carried out
by Calzolari and Bindi (1990) and employed
MI. It was followed by (Basili et al, 1994),
that made use of parsing information;
? Korean: (Shimohata et al, 1997) used an ad-
jacency n-gram model, and (Kim et al, 1999)
relied on POS-tagging;
? Chinese: (Huang et al, 2005) used POS in-
formation, while (Lu et al, 2004) applied ex-
traction techniques similar to Xtract system
(Smadja, 1993);
? Japanese: (Ikehara et al, 1995) was based on
an improved n-gram method.
As for multilingual extraction via alignment
(where collocations are first detected in one lan-
guage and then matched with their translation in
another language), most or the existing work con-
cern the English-French language pair, and the
Hansard corpus of Canadian Parliament proceed-
ings. Wu (1994) signals a number of problems
42
that non-Indo-European languages pose for the
existing alignment methods based on word- and
sentence-length: in Chinese, for instance, most of
the words are just one or two characters long, and
there are no word delimiters. This result suggests
that the portability of existing alignment methods
to new language pairs is questionable.
We are not concerned here with extraction via
alignment. We assume, instead, that multilingual
support in collocation extraction means the cus-
tomization of the extraction procedure for each
language. This topic will be addressed in the next
sections.
4 Multilingualism: Why and How?
4.1 Some Issues
As the previous section showed, many systems of
collocation extraction rely on the linguistic pre-
processing of source corpora in order to support
the candidate identification process. Language-
specific information, such as the one derived from
morphological and syntactic analysis, was shown
to be highly beneficial for extraction. Moreover,
the possibility to apply the association measures
on syntactically homogenous material is argued to
benefit extraction, as the performance of associa-
tion measures might vary with the syntactic con-
figurations because of the differences in distribu-
tion (Krenn and Evert, 2001).
The lexical distribution is therefore a relevant
issue from the perspective of multilingual colloca-
tion extraction. Different languages show different
proportions of lexical categories (N, V, A, Adv,
P, etc.) which are evenly distributed across syn-
tactic types3. Depending on the frequency num-
bers, a given AM could be more suited for a spe-
cific syntactic configuration in one language, and
less suited for the same configuration in another.
Ideally, each language should be assigned a suit-
able set of AMs to be applied on syntactically-
homogenous data.
Another issue that is relevant in the multi-
lingualism perspective is that of the syntactic
configurations characterizing collocations. Sev-
eral such relations (e.g., noun-adjectival modifier,
predicate-argument) are likely to remain constant
through languages, i.e., to be judged as colloca-
tionally interesting in many languages. However,
3For instance, V-P pairs are more represented in English
than in other languages (as phrasal verbs or verb-particle con-
structions).
other configurations could be language-specific
(like P-N-V in German, whose English equiva-
lent is V-P-N). Yet other configurations might have
no counterpart at all in another language (e.g., the
French P-A pair a` neuf is translated into English
as a Conj-A pair, as new).
Finding all the collocationally-relevant syntac-
tic types for a language is therefore another prob-
lem that has to be solved in multilingual extrac-
tion. Since a priori defining these types based
on intuition does not ensure the necessary cover-
age, an alternative proposal is to induce them from
POS data and dependency relations, as in (Seretan,
2005).
The morphoyntactic differences between lan-
guages also have to be taken into account. With
English as the most investigated language, several
hypotheses were put forth in extraction and be-
came common place.
For instance, using a 5-words window as search
space for collocation pairs is a usual practice, since
this span length was shown sufficient to cover a
high percentage of syntactic co-occurrences in En-
glish. But ? as suggested by other researchers,
e.g., (Goldman et al, 2001) ?, this assumption
does not necessary hold for other languages.
Similarly, the higher inflection and the higher
transformation potential shown by some lan-
guages pose additional problems in extraction,
which were rather ignored for English. As Kim et
al. (1999) notice, collocation extraction is particu-
larly difficult in free-order languages like Korean,
where arguments scramble freely. Breidt (1993)
also pointed out a couple of problems that makes
extraction for German more difficult than for En-
glish: the strong inflection for verbs, the variable
word-order, and the positional ambiguity of the ar-
guments. She shows that even distinguishing sub-
jects from objects is very difficult without parsing.
4.2 A Strategy for Multilingual Extraction
Summing up the previous discussion, the cus-
tomization of collocation extraction for a given
language needs to take into account:
- the syntactic configurations characterizing
collocations,
- the lexical distribution over syntactic config-
urations,
- the adequacy of AMs to these configurations.
43
These are language-specific parameters which
need to be set in a successful multilingual extrac-
tion procedure. Truly multilingual systems have
not been developed yet, but we suggest the fol-
lowing strategy for building such a system:
A. parse the source corpus, extract all the syn-
tactic pairs (e.g., head-modifier, predicate-
argument) and rank them with a given AM,
B. analyze the results and find the syntactic con-
figurations characterizing collocations,
C. evaluate the adequacy of AMs for ranking col-
locations in each syntactic configuration, and
find the most convenient mapping configura-
tions - AMs.
Once customized for a language, the extraction
procedure involves:
Stage 1. parsing the source corpus for extract-
ing the lexical pairs in the relevant,
language-specific syntactic configura-
tions found in step B;
Stage 2. ranking the pairs from each syntactic
class with the AM assigned in step C.
5 A Multilingual Collocation Extractor
Based on Parsing
Ever since the collocation was brought to the at-
tention of linguists in the framework of contextu-
alism (Firth, 1957; Firth, 1968), it has been pre-
ponderantly seen as a pure statistical phenomenon
of lexical association. In fact, according to a well-
known definition, ?a collocation is an arbitrary and
recurrent word combination? (Benson, 1990).
This approach was at the basis of the computa-
tional work on collocation, although there exist an
alternative approach ? the linguistic, or lexico-
graphic one ? that imposes a restricted view on
collocation, which is seen first of all as an expres-
sion of language.
The existing extraction work (section 3) shows
that there is a growing interest in adopting the
more restricted (linguistic) view. As mentioned in
section 3, the importance of parsing for extraction
was confirmed by several evaluation experiments.
With the recent development in the field of linguis-
tic analysis, hybrid extraction systems (i.e., sys-
tems relying on syntactical analysis for colloca-
tion extraction) are likely to become the rule rather
than the exception.
Our system (Goldman et al, 2001; Seretan and
Wehrli, 2006) is ? to our knowledge ? the first
to perform the full syntactic analysis as support for
collocation extraction; similar approaches rely on
dependency parsers or on chunking.
It is based on a symbolic parser that was de-
veloped over the last decade (Wehrli, 2004) and
achieves a high level of performance, in terms of
accuracy, speed and robustness. The languages it
supports are, for the time being, French, English,
Italian, Spanish and German. A few other lan-
guages are being also implemented in the frame-
work of a multilingualism project.
Provided that collocation extraction can be seen
as a two-stage process (where, in stage 1, collo-
cation candidates are identified in the text corpora,
and in stage 2, they are ranked according to a given
AM, cf. section 4.2), the role of the parser is to
support the first stage. A pair of lexical items is
selected as a candidate only if there exist a syntac-
tic relation holding between the two items.
Unlike the traditional, window-based methods,
candidate selection is based on syntactic proxim-
ity (as opposed to textual proximity). Another
peculiarity of our system is that candidate pairs
are identified as the parsing goes on; in other ap-
proaches, they are extracted by post-processing
the output of syntactic tools.
The candidate pairs identified are classified into
syntactically homogenous sets, according to the
syntactic relations holding between the two items.
Only certain predefined syntactic relations are
kept, that were judged as collocationally rele-
vant after multiple experiments of extraction and
data analysis (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-object,
subject-verb, noun-noun, verb-preposition-noun).
The sets obtained are then ranked using the log-
likelihood ratios test (Dunning, 1993).
More details about the system and its perfor-
mance can be found in (Seretan and Wehrli, 2006).
The following examples (taken from the extraction
experiment we will describe below) illustrate its
potential to detect collocation candidates, even if
these are subject to complex syntactic transforma-
tions:

tifs fixe?s a` l?e?chelle internationale

1.c) reforzar cooperacio?n (Es): Quer-
emos permitir a los pases que lo

The collocation extractor is part of a bigger sys-
tem (Seretan et al, 2004) that integrates a con-
cordancer and a sentence aligner, and that sup-
ports the visualization, the manual validation and
the management of a multilingual terminology
database. The validated collocations are used for
populating the lexicon of the parser and that of a
translation system (Wehrli, 2003).
6 A Cross-Lingual Extraction
Experiment
A collocation extraction experiment concern-
ing four different languages (English, Spanish,
French, Italian) has been conducted on a parallel
subcorpus of 42 files from the European Parlia-
ment proceedings. Several statistics and extraction
results are reported in Table 1.

Table 1: Extraction statistics
We computed the distribution of pair tokens
according to the syntactic type and noted that
the most marked distributional difference among
these languages concern the following types: N-A
(7.12), A-N (4.26), V-O (2.68), V-P (4.16), N-P-N
(3.81)4.
Unsurprisingly, the Romance languages are less
different in terms of syntactic co-occurrence dis-
tribution, and the deviation of English from the
Romance mean is more pronounced ? in particu-
lar, for N-A (9.72), V-P (5.63), A-N (5.25), N-P-N
4The numbers represent the values the standard deviation
of the relative percentages in the whole lists of pairs.
(4.77), and V-O (3.57). These distributional differ-
ences might account for the types of collocations
highlighted by a particular AM (such as LL) in a
language vs. another. Figure 1 displays the rela-
tive proportions of 3 syntactic types ? adjective-
noun, subject-verb and verb-object ? that can be
found at different levels in the significance list re-
turned by LL.
Figure 1: Cross-lingual proportions of A-N, S-V
and V-O pairs at different levels in the significance
lists
We performed a contrastive analysis of results,
by carrying out a case-study aimed at checking
the LL performance variability across languages.
The study concerned the verb-object collocations
having the noun policy as the direct object. We
specifically focused on the best-scored collocation
extracted from the French corpus, namely mener
une politique (lit., conduct a policy).
We looked at the translation equivalents of its
74 instances identified by our extraction system
in the corpus. The analysis revealed that ? at
least in this particular case ? the verbal collo-
cates of this noun are highly scattered: pursue,
implement, conduct, adopt, apply, develop, have,
draft, launch, run, carry out for English; prac-
ticar, llevar a cabo, desarrollar, realizar, aplicar,
seguir, hacer, adoptar, ejercer for Spanish; con-
durre, attuare, portare avanti, perseguire, pratti-
care, adottare, fare for Italian (among several oth-
ers). Some of the collocates (those listed first) are
more prominently used. But generally they are
highly dispersed, and this might indicate a bigger
difficulty for LL to pinpoint the best collocate in a
language vs. another.
We also observed that quite frequently (in about
25% of the cases) the collocation did not conserve
its syntactic configuration. Either the verb ? here,
45
the equivalent for the French mener ? is omitted
in translations (like in 2.b below):
2.a) des contradictions existent dans la
politique qui est mene?e (Fr);
2.b) we are dealing with contradictory
policy (En),
or, in a few other cases, the whole collocation
disappears, since paraphrased with a completely
different syntactic construction:
3.a) direction qui a mene? une politique
insense?e de re?duction de personnel
(Fr);
3.b) a management that foolishly en-
gaged in staff reductions (En).
In order to quantify the impact such factors have
on the performance of the AM considered, we
further scrutinized the collocates list for politique
proposed by LL test for each language (see Table
2). The rank of a pair in the whole list of verb-
object collocations extracted, as assigned by the
LL test, is shown in the last column. In these sig-
nificance lists, the collocations with politique as an
object constitute a small fraction, and from these,
only the top collocations are displayed in Table 2.
The threshold was manually defined in accordance
with our intuition that the lower-scored pairs ob-
served manifest less a collocational strength. It
happens to be situated around the LL value of 20
for each language (and is of course specific to the
size of our corpus and to the number of V-O tokens
identified therein).
If we consider the LL rank as the success mea-
sure for collocate detection, we can infer that the
collocates of the word under investigation are eas-
ier to found in French, as compared to English,
Italian or Spanish, because the value in the first
row of the last column is smaller. This holds if we
are interested in only one (the most salient) collo-
cate for a word.
If we measure the success of retrieving all the
collocates (by considering, for instance, the speed
to access them in the results list ? the higher the
rank, the better), then French can be again consid-
ered the easiest because overall, the positions in
the V-O list are higher (i.e., the mean of the rank
column is smaller) with respect to Spanish, Italian
and, respectively, English.
This latter result corresponds, approximately,
to the order given by relative proportion of V-O

Table 2: Verbal collocates for the headword policy
pairs in each language (Spanish 15.12%, French
15.14%, Italian 17.06%, and English 20.82%).
Given that in English V-O pairs are more numer-
ous and the verbs also participate in V-P construc-
tions, it might seem reasonable to expect lower
LL scores for V-O collocations in English vs. the
other 3 languages.
In general, we expect a correlation between ex-
traction difficulty and the distributional properties
of co-occurrence types.
7 Conclusion
The paper pointed out several issues that oc-
cur in transfering a hybrid collocation extraction
methodology (that combines linguistic with statis-
tic information) to a new language.
Besides the questionable availability of
language-specific text analysis tools for the new
language, a number of issues that are relevant to
extraction proper were addressed: the changes
in the distribution of (syntactic) word pairs, and
the need to find, for each language, the most
46
appropriate association measure to apply for each
syntactic type (given that AMs are sensitive to
distributions and syntactic types); the lack of
a priori defined syntactic types for a language;
and, finally, the portability of some widely used
techniques (such as the window method) from
English to other languages exhibiting a higher
word order freedom.
It is again in the multilingualism perspective
that the inescapable need for preprocessing the
text emerged (cf. different researchers cited in sec-
tion 3): highly inflected languages need lemma-
tizers, free-word order languages need structural
information in order to guarantee acceptable re-
sults. As language tools become nowadays more
and more available, we expect the collocation ex-
traction (and terminology acquisition in general)
to be exclusively performed in the future by re-
lying on linguistic analysis. We therefore believe
that multilingualism is a true concern for colloca-
tion extraction.
The paper reviewed the extraction work in a
language-oriented fashion, while mentioning the
type of linguistic preprocessing performed when-
ever it was the case, as well as the language-
specific issues identified by the authors. It then
proposed a strategy for implementing a multilin-
gual extraction procedure that takes into account
the language-specific issues identified.
An extraction system for four different lan-
guages, based on full parsing, was then described.
Finally, an experiment was carried out as a case
study, which pointed out several factors that might
determine a particular AM to perform differently
across languages. The experiment suggested that
log-likelihood ratios test might highlight certain
verb-object collocations easier in French than in
Spanish, Italian and English (in terms of salience
in the significance list).
Future work needs to extend the type of cross-
linguistic analysis initiated here, in order to pro-
vide more insights on the differences expected at
extraction between one language and another and
on the responsible factors, and, accordingly, to de-
fines strategies to deal with them.
