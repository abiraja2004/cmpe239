Some 15 years ago, when Machine Translation had become fashionable again in Europe, few 
people would be prepared to consider seriously embarking upon spoken language translation (SLT). 
After all, where neither machine translation of written text, nor speech understanding or speech 
production had led to any significant results yet, it seemed clear that putting three not even 
halfway understood systems together would be premature, and bound to fail. 
Since then, the world has changed. If we look at the papers contained in the proceedings of this 
workshop we can clearly see that many researchers, both in academia nd in industry, have taken 
up the challenge to build systems capable of translating spoken language. Does that mean that 
most of the problems involved in speech-to-text, text-to-text translation, and text-to-speech 
have been solved? Or should we rather conclude that all these courageous people are heading for 
another traumatic experience, just as we have seen happen in the sixties and, to a lesser extent, 
in the eighties. 
The answer to the first question is probably: No  - although we have made a tremendous progress, 
both from a scientific and from a technological point of view, many of the fundamental problems 
in MT and in speech understanding remain unsolved. Yet we are convinced that the bleak scenario 
we mentioned as the alternative does not apply either. 
There are a few reasons why we feel confident that a certain degree of optimism is justified here. 
First of all, it is clear that on the whole people's expectations of what MT will do for them are 
changing. Where in the past the ultimate goal of MT  seemed to be to provide a perfect, but 
cheaper and faster alternative to the human translator, there is now a clear shift from the ideal 
of fully automated high quality translation of unrestricted texts to the more practical problem of 
overcoming the language barriers we encounter in various situations. This shift of focus allows us 
to partition the problem we address into a series of smaller ones, the solution to which may be 
within our reach. In other words, instead of trying to win the war against an enemy we are not 
even sure we can see, we have decided to engage into a series of battles we can be confident of 
winning. 
This applies both to spoken and written language translation. If we look at spoken communication 
between human beings with different native languages, very often the main success criterion for 
this communication is not whether or not the individual sentences produced by the participants 
have been expressed or understood without errors (which will rarely be the case), but rather 
whether the intended goal of the communication has been attained (hotel room reservation, airline 
information, etc). This observation is extremely important when we try to set our goals for spoken 
translation systems. Once we have realized that communication takes place in a specific context, 
with a specific goal, and have accepted that sentence-by-sentence linguistically correct translation 
is not a necessary condition for successful multilingual communication, we can start exploiting the 
full potential of spoken dialogues in human-human and human-machine interaction: the basic 
structure of dialogues, the ways to control dialogue flow, the possibility for repair. 
To summarize, although many of the fundamental problems of MT and speech have not been 
solved, the movement  towards more specialized systems, the redefinition of the notion of success, 
and the potential of dialogues, taken together, give us reason to believe that we will see many 
successful spoken translation systems in the near future, and we hope that this workshop will 
contribute to this. 
In the rest of the introduction we will introduce very briefly the topics of the four sessions of the 
workshop. 
In the proceedings one will also find three 'poster papers'. Although the workshop session itself 
did not leave space for poster presentations, we felt that it was important to dedicate a small 
section of the proceedings to short poster papers, where researchers can communicate to others 
what they are doing, so that people who are interested in the same or related research topics know 
where to go. 
Exploiting and Exploring Dialogue Structure 
SLT is the latest frontier for MT research - perhaps the last frontier. A term sometimes seen used 
is "Machine Interpreting", but it seems that this might apply to only one aspect of SLT, implying 
some activity similar to that of human interpreters, i.e. simultaneous or consecutive translation 
of spoken language, often in the context of a meeting or someone addressing a group of people. 
Notice that such speech may or may not be wholly spontaneous. This contrasts with the type 
of SLT  which is the theme of this first session, and indeed more predominantly influences SLT 
research so far, namely Dialogue Translation. Let us note in passing a third type of SLT, "Message 
passing", for example so-called "voice-mall", or real-time messages between emergency or security 
services across linguistic borders (e.g. the Channel Tunnel). 
Within the subdomain of Dialogue Translation, we can make some further relevant distinctions, 
all of which will impinge on the design of the MT system: telephonic vs. face-to-face dialogue, 
co-operative vs. adversarial (Kay et a/1994:175f), involving completely or partially monolingual 
speakers, with or without system-user "meta-dialogue" (Somerset a/1990), and so on. 
Dialogue MT introduces interesting problems beyond the already difficult issues of integrating 
speech processing with translation. As has clearly been recognised in the three papers which 
make up this opening session, identifying the special pragmatic features of spoken dialogue which 
distinguish such "texts" from the type of input that a traditional MT system might deal with is 
a crucial part of the problem. Traditionally (e.g. Hutchins & Somers 1992:92)~ the incorpora- 
tion of contextual knowledge into an MT system was just dismissed as impractical, or at best, 
uneconomical. In a dialogue system, such an approach is unthinkable. 
Manfred Stede and Birte Schmitz initiate the proceedings with a close look at "discourse particles", 
the little words which can carry so much meaning, especially in terms of the overall dialogue 
structure. An  additional problem is that many of these particles are ambiguous in that they also 
have an interpretation not related to discourse structure. 
Jae-won Lee et allook at words whose translation is particularly dependent on the context, a 
problem which is exacerbated in a language-pair such as Korean-English. Their approach is to 
apply a statistical model of dialogue structure based on trigrams of speech acts. 
Keiko Horiguchi discusses meaningful "errors" in speech which convey contextual meaning or the 
speaker's attitude, and then focuses on the translation of discourse particles from Japanese into 
English. The approach adopted here is an analogical framework using a Cascaded Noisy Channel 
Model.

Dealing with Differences 
Although translation of written and spoken language have much in common, there is no evading the 
fact that text and speech are in some ways fundamentally different modalities. The impermanent 
nature of vocal communication makes speech an intrinsically more unreliable medium; conversely, 
a spoken utterance contains information that is only residually present in its text version, such as 
prosody, tone and accent. 
The three papers in this section explore some aspects of the SLT problem which highlight the 
differences between translation of written and spoken text. Yumi Wakita et aldescribe a method 
which attempts to extract the parts of a spoken utterance which have been reliably recognized, 
ignoring those which represent probable recognition errors. They present results indicating that 
their method has an appreciable effect on the performance of a Japanese-English speech translation 
system. 
Keiko Horiguchi and Alexander Franz describe another piece of work aimed at counteracting 
the problems involved in taking translation input from a speech recognizer. They present an 
example-based hybrid approach containing aspects of both corpus-based and rule-based styles 
of translation architecture; this move towards hybrid architectures seems to represent a strong 
tendency in current work within the field of SLT  
Finally, Pascale Fung et alpresent a paper focussed on the problems which a speech recognizer 
has to contend with in a multilingual environment, where people typically speak using a variety of 
languages and accents. The paper describes initial experiments which investigate the parameters 
of the problem, and in particular explores the possibility of constructing recognizers capable of 
recognizing multilingual input. 
Towards Efficiency 
The papers in this section address problems of efficiency in two senses. On  the one hand SLT has 
to meet specific requirements of effciency and robustness in processing, because 
? speech recognition is imperfect and the input is often not a string but a lattice of word 
hypotheses representing a set of possible utterances 
? spoken utterances are often linguistically not well-formed 
? the translation must be available nearly simultaneously with the utterance 
? the quality of the translation must be sufficiently high as in most applications post-editing 
is not possible. The approach of Frederking et a/differs in this respect as it allows for user 
interaction to improve the translation. 
To solve these problems finite state transducer technologies are often employed and investigated. 
The papers by Alshawi et a/and Amengual et aldiscuss different approaches along these lines. 
Both attempt to gain additional efficiency by a tight integration of analysis and transfer instead 
of assuming two different processing stages. 
Another efffciency problem is that of acquiring the knowledge for building such a system. SLT 
systems are often heavily restricted to specific domains and in their vocabulary. This raises the 
question how such systems can be adapted to new domains and vocabulary. Therefore corpus- 
based statistical methods for language modelling and automatic acquisition are of special interest 
for SLT as addressed in in Amengual et aland Frederking eta/. 
iii 
Methodo log ica l  I ssues  
The common theme for the final three papers in the workshop is an emphasis on methodology 
and architecture. In the first two, the focus is on the methodology required when one moves from 
one application domain to another. In the case of the first paper, it is the move from smaller 
domains to larger more inclusive domains, in the case of the second, it is the move "across" from 
one domain to a distinct and separate domain of similar size. Both papers explore the sorts of 
approach and architecture that the different sorts of move require. Given that the state of the 
art in Speech Translation is such that realistic applications are restricted to particular domains, 
this sort of study is clearly of general importance. The third paper, by Mark Seligman, takes a 
broader methodological nd architectural perspective, and identifies ix issues of importance to 
the field as a whole. 
The first paper in the section, Lavie et al focuses on the issues that arise when one transfers 
from a relatively narrow domain (in this case, Appointment Scheduling dialogues) to a broader 
domain (Travel Planning dialogues). The paper describes ome preliminary results of making this 
transfer for the JANUS system, and some modifications that may be required. Differences between 
smaller and larger domains include a higher out-of-vocabulary rate, a higher rate of ambiguity, and 
generally the existence of a much wider range of expressions and expressive devices in dialogues 
which make the 'semantic grammar' approach - -  which worked well in the narrower domain 
problematic. Lavie et a/'s suggestion is that this problem and the problems that arise from 
increased ambiguity can both be overcome if the larger domain can be factored into a number of 
sub-domains, each of which can be given its own semantic grammar. Such sub-grammars should 
be far less ambiguous than a grammar for the whole domain would be, if parsing proceeds with 
separate sub-grammars in parallel, which should also yield benefits in terms of processing speed. 
In the second paper in this section (by Carter eta/), the main issue is not how one can broaden or 
enlarge the domain of a system, but how one can move from one domain to a distinct, potentially 
unrelated, domain of similar size (or even to a distinct language pair, which can raise similar 
issues - -  this should be clear if one compares moving between pairs of very similar languages 
which may share a great deal of grammar and vocabulary with moving between very different 
domains which share very few features of grammar and vocabulary). In other words, the focus is 
on the problems of customizing systems for new domains and languages. Carter et alargue that the 
characteristics of the Core Language Engine - -  the language processing component of the system 
they are describing (SLT) -- facilitate this customization. In particular, they suggest that the use 
of a general-purpose linguistic rule component, and a transfer architecture, in combination with 
statistical information derived from supervised training on corpora make most of the SLT system 
portable across domains, and even languages, and the remaining, non-portable, parts of the system 
are such that they require relatively little expert knowledge. This conclusion is interestingly at 
variance with that of Lavie et a/in the previous paper, who argue for an interlingual approach to 
translation and the use of domain-specific semantic grammars. 
The final contribution in this section is Mark Seligman's, which takes a personal perspective 
in identifying six areas of SLT  research as particularly interesting. (I) He argues the need for 
interactive disambiguation (a view that the authors of the other papers in this section would 
probably reject), and (2) for a particular kind of system architecture (a variant of the blackboard 
architecture incorporating a supervisory coordinator program) which may also be controversial. 
(3) The third issue he addresses is that of how Speech Recognition and MT techniques hould 
be integrated - -  in particular, whether a single set of techniques can or should be used to cover 
both tasks, e.g. parsing to the level of phones. Seligman suggests that this is promising, though 
there are technical problems. (4) Seligman's fourth issue is how far natural pauses can be used 
in segmenting utterances, and how far analysis and translation can proceed on the basis of such 
segmentation. (5) The fifth issue recognizes the importance of Speech Act identification i dialogue 
translation, and considers how a defensible and usable classification may be found. (6) Finally, 
there is the question of how one can restrict the range of candidate lexical items that have to 
iv 
be considered at each point in processing, and how candidates can be weighted appropriately. 
Seligman observes that accepting the importance of these issues suggests a particular architecture 
for an experimental SLT system which differs from systems described in other contributions in 
significant ways. 
Concluding Remarks 
As we wdcome delegates to what we believe is the first major open meeting in Europe devoted 
entirely to SLT, but surely not the last, we signal yet another important milestone in the history 
of Machine Translation. Just fifty years since Warren Weaver, in his letter to Norbert Wiener 
(later reproduced in his famous memorandum), first expressed realistic hopes for "mechanical 
translation" (see Hutchins, in press), we find ourselves realistically discussing the possibility of 
using computers to translate the spoken word. Dismissed not so long ago as an impossible dream, 
the contributions to this workshop demonstrate that, while still perhaps something of a dream, 
it is far from impossible. As the world of MT looks for new directions, SLT offers a wide range 
of new challenges. This new focus will be reflected in a Special Issue of the journal Machine 
Translation devoted to SLT, for which a call for papers will be issued soon; and already we can 
see, in other MT-related conferences and publications, a clear inclination towards this problem 
area. Let us hope that in years to come, the Workshop on Spoken Language Translation at 
the 1997 ACL/EACL meeting in Madrid is seen as an important and memorable vent in the 
development of SLT techniques.
