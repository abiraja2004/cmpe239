Abstract
This paper presents an unsupervised
graph-based method for automatic word
sense induction and disambiguation. The
innovative part of our method is the as-
signment of either a word or a word pair
to each vertex of the constructed graph.
Word senses are induced by clustering the
constructed graph. In the disambiguation
stage, each induced cluster is scored ac-
cording to the number of its vertices found
in the context of the target word. Our sys-
tem participated in SemEval-2010 word
sense induction and disambiguation task.
1 Introduction
There exists significant evidence that word sense
disambiguation is important for a variety of nat-
ural language processing tasks: machine transla-
tion, information retrieval, grammatical analysis,
speech and text processing (Veronis, 2004). How-
ever, the ?fixed-list? of senses paradigm, where the
senses of a target word is a closed list of defini-
tions coming from a standard dictionary (Agirre
et al, 2006), was long ago abandoned. The rea-
son is that sense lists, such as WordNet (Miller,
1995), miss many senses, especially domain-
specific ones (Pantel and Lin, 2002). The miss-
ing concepts are not recognised. Moreover, senses
cannot be easily related to their use in context.
Word sense induction methods can be divided
into vector-space models and graph based ones.
In a vector-space model, each context of a target
word is represented as a feature vector, e.g. fre-
quency of cooccurring words (Katz and Gies-
brecht, 2006). Context vectors are clustered and
the resulting clusters represent the induced senses.
Recently, graph-based methods have been em-
ployed for word sense induction (Agirre and
Soroa, 2007). Typically, graph-based methods
represent each context word of the target word as
a vertex. Two vertices are connected via an edge
if they cooccur in one or more instances. Once
the cooccurrence graph has been constructed, dif-
ferent graph clustering algorithms are applied to
partition the graph. Each cluster (partition) con-
sists of a set of words that are semantically related
to the particular sense (Veronis, 2004). The poten-
tial advantage of graph-based methods is that they
can combine both local and global cooccurrence
information (Agirre et al, 2006).
Klapaftis and Manandhar (2008) presented a
graph-based approach that represents pairs of
words as vertices instead of single words. They
claimed that single words might appear with more
than one senses of the target word, while they hy-
pothesize that a pair of words is unambiguous.
Hard-clustering the graph will potentially identify
less conflating senses of the target word.
In this paper, we relax the above hypothesis be-
cause in some cases a single word is unambiguous.
We present a method that generates two-word ver-
tices only when a single word vertex is unambigu-
ous. If the word is judged as unambiguous, then it
is represented as a single-word vertex. Otherwise,
it is represented as a pair-of-words vertex.
The approach of Klapaftis and Manandhar
(2008) achieved good results in both evaluation
settings of the SemEval-2007 task. A test in-
stance is disambiguated towards one of the in-
duced senses if one or more pairs of words rep-
resenting that sense cooccur in the test instance.
This creates a sparsity problem, because a cooc-
currence of two words is generally less likely than
the occurrence of a single word. We expect our ap-
proach to address the data sparsity problem with-
out conflating the induced senses.
2 Word Sense Induction
In this section we present our word sense in-
duction and disambiguation algorithms. Figure
355
1 shows an example showing how the sense in-
duction algorithm works: The left side of part
I shows the context nouns of four snippets con-
taining the target noun ?chip?. The most rele-
vant of these nouns are represented as single word
vertices (part II). Note that ?customer? was not
judged to be significantly relevant. In addition,
the system introduced several vertices represent-
ing pairs of nouns. For example, note the vertex
?company potato?. The set of sentences contain-
ing the context word ?company? was judged as
very different from the set of sentences contain-
ing ?company? and ?potato?. Thus, our system
hypothesizes that probably ?company? and ?com-
pany potato? are relevant to different senses of
?chip?, and allows them to be clustered accord-
ingly. Vertices whose content nouns or pairs of
nouns cooccur in some snippet are connected with
an edge (part III and right side of part I). Edge
weights depend upon the conditional probabilities
of the occurrence frequencies of the vertex con-
tents in a large corpus, e.g. w
2,6
in part III. Hard-
clustering the graph produces the induced senses
of ?chip?: (a) potato crisp, and (b) microchip.
In the following subsections, the system is de-
scribed in detail. Figure 2 shows a block diagram
overview of the sense induction system. It consists
of three main components: (a) corpus preprocess-
ing, (b) graph construction, and (c) clustering.
In a number of different stages, the system uses
a reference corpus to count occurrences of word
or word pairs. It is chosen to be large because fre-
quencies of words in a large corpus are more sig-
nificant statistically. Ideally we would use the web
or another large repository, but for the purposes of
the SemEval-2010 task we used the union of all
snippets of all target words.
2.1 Corpus Preprocessing
Corpus preprocessing aims to capture words that
are contextually related to the target word. Ini-
tially, all snippets
1
that contain the target word are
lemmatised and PoS tagged using the GENIA tag-
ger
2
. Words that occur in a stoplist are filtered out.
Instead of using all words as context, only nouns
are kept, since they are more discriminative than
verbs, adverbs and adjectives, that appear in a va-
riety of different contexts.
1
We refer to instances of the target word as snippets, since
they can be either sentences or paragraphs.

Figure 1: An example showing how the proposed
word sense induction system works.
Nouns that occur infrequently in the reference
corpus are removed (parameter P
1
). Then, log-
likelihood ratio (LL) (Dunning, 1993) is em-
ployed to compare the distribution of each noun
to its distribution in reference corpus. The null
hypothesis is that the two distributions are simi-
lar. If this is true, LL is small value and the cor-
responding noun is removed (parameter P
2
). We
also filter out nouns that are more indicative in the
reference corpus than in the target word corpus;
i.e. the nouns whose relative frequency in the for-
mer is larger than in the latter. At the end of this
stage, each snippet is a list of lemmatised nouns
contextually related to the target word.
2.2 Constructing the Graph
All nouns appearing in the list of the previous
stage output are represented as graph vertices.
Moreover, some vertices representing pairs of
nouns are added. Each noun within a snippet is
combined with every other, generating
(
n
2
)
pairs.
Log-likelihood filtering with respect to the refer-
ence corpus is used to filter out unimportant pairs.
Thereafter, we aim to keep only pairs that might
refer to a different sense of the target word than
their component nouns. For each pair we construct
a vector containing the snippet IDs in which they
occur. Similarly we construct a vector for each
component noun. We discard a pair if its vector is
very similar to both the vectors of its component
nouns, otherwise we represent it as a vertex pair.
Dice coefficient was used as a similarity measure
and parameter P
4
as threshold value.
Edges are drawn based on cooccurrence of the
corresponding vertices contents in one or more
snippets. Edges whose respective vertices con-
tents are infrequent are rejected. The weight ap-

plied to each edge is the maximum of the condi-
tional probabilities of the corresponding vertices
contents (e.g. w
2,6
, part III, figure 1). Low weight
edges are filtered out (parameter P
3
).
2.3 Clustering the Graph
Chinese Whispers (CW) (Biemann, 2006) was
used to cluster the graph. CW is a randomised
graph-clustering algorithm, time-linear to the
number of edges. The number of clusters it pro-
duces is automatically inferred. Evaluation has
shown that CW suits well in sense induction appli-
cations, where class distributions are often highly
skewed. In our experiments, CW produced less
clusters using a constant mutation rate (5%).
To further reduce the number of induced clus-
ters, we applied a post-processing stage, which
exploits the one sense per collocation property
(Yarowsky, 1995). For each cluster l
i
, we gener-
ated the set S
i
of all snippets that contain at least
one vertex content of l
i
. Then, any clusters l
a
and
l
b
were merged if S
a
? S
b
or S
a
? S
b
.
3 Word Sense Disambiguation
The induced senses are used to sense-tag each test
instance of the target word (snippet). Given a snip-
pet, each induced cluster is assigned a score equal
to the number of its vertex contents (single or pairs
of words) occurring in the snippet. The instance is
assigned to the sense with the highest score or with
equal weights to all highest scoring senses.
4 Tuning parameter and inducing senses
The algorithm depends upon 4 parameters: P
1
thresholds frequencies and P
3
collocation weights.
P
2
is the LL threshold and P
4
the similarity thresh-
old for discarding pair-of-nouns vertices.
We chose P
1
? {5, 10, 15}, P
2
?
{2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35}, P
3
? {0.2, 0.3, 0.4}
and P
4
? {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}. The parameter tun-
ing was done using the trial data of the SemEval-
2010 task and on the noun data of correspond-
ing SemEval-2007 task. Parameters were tuned
by choosing the maximum supervised recall. For
both data sets, the chosen parameter values were
P
1
? 10, P
3
? 0.4 and P
4
? 0.8. Due to the
size difference of the datasets, for the Semeval-
2010 trial data P
2
? 3, while for the SemEval-
2007 noun data P
2
? 10. The latter was adopted
because the size of training data was announced to
be large. We induced senses on the training data
and then disambiguated the test data instances.
5 Evaluation results
Three different measures, V-Measure, F-Score,
and supervised recall on word sense disambigua-
tion task, were used for evaluation. V-Measure
and F-Score are unsupervised. Supervised recall
was measured on two different data splits. Table 1
shows the performance of our system, UoY, for all
measures and in comparison with the best, worst
and average performing system and the random
and most frequent sense (MFS) baselines. Results
are shown for all words, and nouns and verbs only.

Table 2 shows the ranks of UoY for all evalu-
ation categories. Our system was generally very
highly ranked. It outperformed the random base-
line in all cases and the MFS baseline in measures
but F-Score. No participant system managed to
achive higher F-Score than the MFS baseline.
The main disadvantage of the system seems to
be the large number of induced senses. The rea-
sons are data sparcity and tuning on nouns, that
might have led to parameters that induce more
senses. However, the system performs best among
systems that produce comparable numbers of clus-
ters. Table 3 shows the number of senses of UoY
and the gold-standard. UoY produces significantly
more senses than the gold-standard, especially for
nouns, while for verbs figures are similar.
The system achieves low F-Scores, because this
measure favours fewer induced senses. Moreover,
we observe that most scores are lower for verbs
than nouns. This is probably because parameters
are tuned on nouns and because in general nouns
appear with more senses than verbs, allowing our
system to adapt better. As an overall conclusion,
each evaluation measure is more or less biased to-
wards small or large numbers of induced senses.
6 Conclusion
We presented a graph-based approach for word
sense induction and disambiguation. Our ap-
proach represents as a graph vertex an unambigu-
ous unit: (a) a single word, if it is judged as unam-
biguous, or (b) a pair of words, otherwise. Graph
edges model the cooccurrences of the content of

graph induces a set of senses. To disambiguate
a test instance, we assign it to the induced sense
whose vertices contents occur mostly in the in-
stance. Results show that our system achieves very
high recall and V-measure performance, higher
than both baselines. It achieves low F-Scores due
to the large number of induced senses.
