Abstract
We propose a method for annotating post-
to-post discourse structure in online user
forum data, in the hopes of improving
troubleshooting-oriented information ac-
cess. We introduce the tasks of: (1) post
classification, based on a novel dialogue
act tag set; and (2) link classification. We
also introduce three feature sets (structural
features, post context features and seman-
tic features) and experiment with three dis-
criminative learners (maximum entropy,
SVM-HMM and CRF).We achieve above-
baseline results for both dialogue act and
link classification, with interesting diver-
gences in which feature sets perform well
over the two sub-tasks, and go on to per-
form preliminary investigation of the inter-
action between post tagging and linking.
1 Introduction
With the advent of Web 2.0, there has been an ex-
plosion of web authorship from individuals of all
walks of life. Notably, social networks, blogs and
web user forums have entered the mainstream of
modern-day society, creating both new opportuni-
ties and challenges for organisations seeking to en-
gage with clients or users of any description. One
area of particular interest is web-based user sup-
port, e.g. to aid a user in purchasing a gift for a
friend, or advising a customer on how to config-
ure a newly-acquired wireless router. While such
interactions traditionally took place on an indi-
vidual basis, leading to considerable redundancy
for frequently-arising requests or problems, user
forums support near-real-time user interaction in
the form of a targeted thread made up of individ-
ual user posts. Additionally, they have the poten-
tial for perpetual logging to allow other users to
benefit from them. This in turn facilitates ?sup-
port sharing??i.e. the ability for users to look
over the logs of past support interactions to deter-
mine whether there is a documented, immediately-
applicable solution to their current problem?on a
scale previously unimaginable. This research is
targeted at this task of enhanced support sharing,
in the form of text mining over troubleshooting-
oriented web user forum data (Baldwin et al, to
appear).
One facet of our proposed strategy for enhanc-
ing information access to troubleshooting-oriented
web user forum data is to preprocess threads to
uncover the ?content structure? of the thread, in
the form of its post-to-post discourse structure.
Specifically, we identify which earlier post(s) a
given post responds to (linking) and in what man-
ner (tagging), in an amalgam of dialogue act tag-
ging (Stolcke et al, 2000) and coherence-based
discourse analysis (Carlson et al, 2001; Wolf and
Gibson, 2005). The reason we do this is gauge
the relative role/import of individual posts, to in-
dex and weight component terms accordingly, ul-
timately in an attempt to enhance information ac-
cess. Evidence to suggest that this structure can
enhance information retrieval effectiveness comes
from Xi et al (2004) and Seo et al (2009) (see
Section 2).
To illustrate the task, consider the thread from
the CNET forum shown in Figure 1, made up of
5 posts (Post 1, ..., Post 5) with 4 distinct partici-
pants (A, B, C, D). In the first post, A initiates the
thread by requesting assistance in creating a web
form. In response, B proposes a Javascript-based
solution (i.e. responds to the first post with a pro-
posed solution), and C proposes an independent
solution based on .NET (i.e. also responds to the
first post with a proposed solution). Next, A re-
sponds to C?s post asking for details of how to in-
clude this in a web page (i.e. responds to the third
post asking for clarification), and in the final post,
D proposes a different solution again (i.e. responds
to the first post with a different solution again).

Figure 2: Post links and dialogue act labels for the
example thread in Figure 1
In this, we therefore end up with a tree-based de-
pendency link structure, with each post (other than
the initial post) relating back to a unique preced-
ing post via a range of link types, as indicated in
Figure 2. Note, however, that more generally, it
is possible for a post to link to multiple preced-
ing posts (e.g. refuting one proposed solution, and
proposing a different solution to the problem in the
initial post).
Our primary contributions in this paper are: (1)
a novel post label set for post structure in web
forum data, and associated dataset; and (2) a se-
ries of results for post dependency linking and la-
belling, which achieve strong results for the re-
spective tasks.
2 Related Work
Related work exists in the broad fields of dialogue
processing, discourse analysis and information re-
trieval, and can be broken down into the following
tasks: (1) dialogue act tagging; (2) discourse ?dis-
entanglement?; (3) community question answer-
ing; and (4) newsgroup/user forum search.
Dialogue act (DA) tagging is a means of cap-
turing the function of a given utterance relative
to an encompassing discourse, and has been pro-
posed variously as a means of enhancing dialogue
summarisation (Murray et al, 2006), and track-
ing commitments and promises in email (Cohen
et al, 2004; Lampert et al, 2008), as well as be-
ing shown to improve speech recognition accu-
racy (Stolcke et al, 2000). A wide range of DA
tag sets have been proposed, usually customised
to a particular medium such as speech dialogue
(Stolcke et al, 2000; Shriberg et al, 2004), task-
focused email (Cohen et al, 2004; Wang et al,
2007; Lampert et al, 2008) or instant messag-
ing (Ivanovic, 2008). The most immediately rel-
evant DA-based work we are aware of is that of
Xi et al (2004), who proposed a 5-way classifi-
cation for newsgroup data (including QUESTION
and AGREEMENT/AMMENDMENT), but did not
present any results based on the tagset.
A range of supervised models have been applied
to DA classification, including graphical mod-
els (Ji and Bilmes, 2005), kernel methods (Wang
et al, 2007), dependency networks (Carvalho
and Cohen, 2005), transformation-based learning
(Samuel et al, 1998), maxent models (Ang et
al., 2005) and HMMs (Ivanovic, 2008). There is
some contention about the import of context in DA
classification, with the prevailing view being that
context aids classification (Carvalho and Cohen,
2005; Ang et al, 2005; Ji and Bilmes, 2005), but
also evidence to suggest that strictly local mod-
elling is superior (Ries, 1999; Serafin and Di Eu-
genio, 2004).
In this work, we draw on existing work (esp.
Xi et al (2004)) in proposing a novel DA tag
set customised to the analysis of troubleshooting-
oriented web user forums (Section 3), and com-
pare a range of text classification and structured
classification methods for post-level DA classifi-
cation.
Discourse disentanglement is the process of
automatically identifying coherent sub-discourses
in a single thread (in the context of user fo-
rums/mailing lists), chat session (in the context of
IRC chat data: Elsner and Charniak (2008)), sys-
tem interaction (in the context of HCI: Lemon et
al. (2002)) or document (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).
The exact definition of what constitutes a sub-
discourse varies across domains, but for our pur-
poses, entails an attempt to resolve the informa-
193
tion need of the initiator by a particular approach;
if there are competing approaches proposed in a
single thread, multiple sub-discourses will neces-
sarily arise. The data structure used to represent
the disentangled discourse varies from a simple
connected sub-graph (Elsner and Charniak, 2008),
to a stack/tree (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lemon
et al, 2002; Seo et al, 2009), to a full directed
acyclic graph (DAG: Rose? et al (1995), Wolf and
Gibson (2005), Schuth et al (2007)). Disentan-
glement has been carried out via analysis of di-
rect citation/user name references (Schuth et al,
2007; Seo et al, 2009), topic modelling (Lin et al,
2009), and clustering over content-based features
for pairs of posts, optionally incorporating various
constraints on post recency (Elsner and Charniak,
2008; Wang et al, 2008; Seo et al, 2009).
In this work, we follow Rose? et al (1995) and
Wolf and Gibson (2005) in adopting a DAG repre-
sentation of discourse structure, and draw on the
wide set of features used in discourse entangle-
ment to model coherence.
Community question answering (cQA) is the
task of identifying question?answer pairs in a
given thread, e.g. for the purposes of thread sum-
marisation (Shrestha and McKeown, 2004) or au-
tomated compilation of resources akin to Yahoo!
Answers. cQA has been applied to both mail-
ing list and user forum threads, conventionally
based on question classification, followed by rank-
ing of candidate answers relative to each question
(Shrestha and McKeown, 2004; Ding et al, 2008;
Cong et al, 2008; Cao et al, 2009). The task is
somewhat peripheral to our work, but relevant in
that it involves the implicit tagging of certain posts
as containing questions/answers, as well as link-
ing the posts together. Once again, we draw on the
features used in cQA in this research.
There has been a spike of recent interest in
newsgroup/user forum search. Xi et al (2004)
proposed a structured information retrieval (IR)
model for newsgroup search, based on author fea-
tures, thread structure (based on the tree defined by
the reply-to structure), thread ?topology? features
and content-based features, and used a supervised
ranking method to improve over a baseline IR sys-
tem. Elsas and Carbonell (2009) ? building on
earlier work on blog search (Elsas et al, 2008) ?
proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks
user forum threads relative to selected posts in the
overall thread, and again demonstrated the superi-
ority of this method over a model which ignores
thread structure. Finally, Seo et al (2009) auto-
matically derived thread structure from user forum
threads, and demonstrated that the IR effectiveness
over the ?threaded? structure was superior to that
using a monolithic document representation.
The observations and results of Xi et al (2004)
and Seo et al (2009) that threading information
(or in our case ?disentangled? DAG structure) en-
hances IR effectiveness is a core motivator for this
research.
3 Post Label Set
Our post label set contains 12 categories, intended
to capture the typical interactions that take place in
troubleshooting-oriented threads on technical fo-
rums. There are 2 super-categories (QUESTION,
ANSWER) and 3 singleton classes (RESOLUTION,
REPRODUCTION, and OTHER). QUESTION, in
turn, contains 4 sub-classes (QUESTION, ADD,
CONFIRMATION, CORRECTION), while ANSWER
contains 5 sub-classes (ANSWER, ADD, CONFIR-
MATION, CORRECTION, and OBJECTION), par-
tially mirroring the sub-structure of QUESTION.
We represent the amalgam of a super- and sub-
class as QUESTION-ADD, for example.
All tags other than QUESTION-QUESTION and
OTHER are relational, i.e. relate a given post to a
unique earlier post. A given post can potentially
be labelled with multiple tags (e.g. confirm details
of a proposed solution, in addition to providing ex-
tra details of the problem), although, based on the
strictly chronological ordering of posts in threads,
a post can only link to posts earlier in the thread
(and can also not cross thread boundaries). Addi-
tionally, the link structure is assumed to be tran-
sitive, in that if post A links to post B and post B
to post C, post A is implicitly linked to post C. As
such, an explicit link from post A to post C should
exist only in the case that the link between them is
not inferrable transitively.
Detailed definitions of each post tag are given
below. Note that initiator refers to the user who
started the thread with the first post.
QUESTION-QUESTION (Q-Q): the post con-
tains a new question, independent of the
thread context that precedes it. In general,
QUESTION-QUESTION is reserved for the
first post in a given thread.
QUESTION-ADD (Q-ADD): the post supple-
194
ments a question by providing additional
information, or asking a follow-up question.
QUESTION-CONFIRMATION (Q-CONF): the
post points out error(s) in a question without
correcting them, or confirms details of the
question.
QUESTION-CORRECTION (Q-CORR): the post
corrects error(s) in a question.
ANSWER-ANSWER (A-A): the post proposes an
answer to a question.
ANSWER-ADD (A-ADD): the post supplements
an answer by providing additional informa-
tion.
ANSWER-CONFIRMATION (A-CONF): the
post points out error(s) in an answer without
correcting them, or confirms details of the
answer.
ANSWER-CORRECTION (A-CORR): the post
corrects error(s) in an answer.
ANSWER-OBJECTION (A-OBJ): the post ob-
jects to an answer on experiential or theoreti-
cal grounds (e.g. It won?t work.).
RESOLUTION (RES): the post confirms that an
answer works, on the basis of implementing
it.
REPRODUCTION (REP): the post either: (1)
confirms that the same problem is being ex-
perienced (by a non-initiator, e.g. I?m seeing
the same thing.); or (2) confirms that the an-
swer should work.
OTHER (OTHER): the post does not belong to
any of the above classes.
4 Feature Description
In this section, we describe our post feature repre-
sentation, in the form of four feature types.
4.1 Lexical features
As our first feature type, we use simple lexical fea-
tures, in the form of unigram and bigram tokens
contained within a given post (without stopping).
We also POS tagged and lemmatised the posts,
postfixing the lemmatised token with its POS tag
(using Lingua::EN::Tagger and morpha (Min-
nen et al, 2001)). Finally, we bin together the
counts for each token, and represent it via its raw
frequency.
4.2 Structural features
The identity of the post author, and position of the
post within the thread, can be indicators of the
post/link structure of a given post. We represent
the post author as a simple binary feature indicat-
ing whether s/he is the thread initiator, and the post
position via its relative position in the thread (as a
ratio, relative to the total number of posts).
4.3 Post context features
As mentioned in Section 2, post context has gen-
erally (but not always) been shown to enhance the
classification accuracy of DA tagging tasks, in the
form of Markov features providing predicted post
labels for previous posts, or more simply, post-to-
post similarity. We experiment with a range of
post context features, all of which are compatible
with features both from the same label set as that
being classified (e.g. link features for link classifi-
cation), as well as features from a second label set
(e.g. DA label features for link classification).
Previous Post: There is a strong prior for posts
to link to their immediately preceding post (as ob-
served for 79.9% of the data in our dataset), and
also strong sequentiality in our post label set (e.g.
a post following a Q-Q is most likely to be an A-
A). As such, we represent the predicted post label
of the immediately preceding post, as a first-order
Markov feature, as well as a binary feature to in-
dicate whether the author of the previous post also
authored the current post.
Previous Post from Same Author: A given
user tends to author posts of the same basic type
(e.g. QUESTION or ANSWER) in a given thread,
and pairings such as A-A and A-CONF from a
given author are very rare. To capture this obser-
vation, we look to see if the author of the current
post has posted earlier in the thread, and if so, in-
clude the label and relative location (in posts) of
their most recent previous post.
Full History: As a final option, we include the
predictions for all posts P1, ..., Pi?1 preceding the
current post Pi.
4.4 Semantic features
We tested four semantic features based on post
content and title.
195
Title Similarity: For forums such as CNET
which include titles for individual posts (as rep-
resented in Figure 1), a post having the same or
similar title as a previous post is often a strong
indicator that it responds to that post. This both
provides a strong indicator of which post a given
post responds (links) to, and can aid in DA tag-
ging. We use simple cosine similarity to find the
post with the most-similar title, and represent its
relative location to the current post.
Post Similarity: Posts of the same general type
tend to have similar content and be linked. For
example, A-A and A-ADD posts tend to share
content. We capture this by identifying the post
with most-similar content based on cosine similar-
ity, and represent its relative location to the current
post.
Post Characteristics: We separately represent
the number of question marks, exclamation marks
and URLs in the current post. In general, ques-
tion marks occur in QUESTION and CONFIRMA-
TION posts, exclamation marks occur in RES and
OBJECTION posts, and URLs occur in A-A and
A-ADD posts.
User Profile: Some authors tend to answer ques-
tions more, while others tend to ask more ques-
tions. We capture the class priors for the author of
the current post by the distribution of post labels
in their posts in the training data.
5 Experimental Setup
As our dataset, we collected 320 threads contain-
ing a total of 1,332 posts from the Operating Sys-
tem, Software, Hardware, and Web Development
sub-forums of CNET.1
The annotation of post labels and links was car-
ried by two annotators in a custom-built web inter-
face which supported multiple labels and links for
a given post. For posts with multilabels, we used
a modified version of Cohen?s Kappa, which re-
turned ? values of 0.59 and 0.78 for the post label
and link annotations, respectively. Any disagree-
ments in labelling were resolved through adjudi-
cation.
Of the 1332 posts, 65 posts have multiple labels
(which possibly link to a common post) and 22
posts link to two different links. The majority post
label in the dataset is A-A (40.30%).

We built machine learners using a conven-
tional Maximum Entropy (ME) learner,2 as well as
two structural learners, namely: (1) SVM-HMMs
(Joachims et al, 2009), as implemented in SVM-
struct3, with a linear kernel; and (2) conditional
random fields (CRFs) using CRF++.4 SVM-
HMMs and CRFs have been successfully applied
to a range of sequential tagging tasks such as
syllabification (Bartlett et al, 2009), chunk pars-
ing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and word segmen-
tation (Zhao et al, 2006). Both are discrimina-
tive models which capture structural dependen-
cies, which is highly desirable in terms of mod-
elling sequential preferences between post labels
(e.g. A-CONF typically following a A-A). SVM-
HMM has the additional advantage of scaling to
large numbers of features (namely the lexical fea-
tures). As such, we only experiment with lexical
features for SVM-HMM and ME.
All of our evaluation is based on stratified 10-
fold cross-validation, stratifying at the thread level
to ensure that if a given post is contained in the
test data for a given iteration, all other posts in
that same thread are also in the test data (or more
pertinently, not in the training data). We evalu-
ate using micro-averaged precision, recall and F-
score (? = 1). We test the statistical significance
of all above-baseline results using randomised es-
timation (p < 0.05; Yeh (2000)), and present all
such results in bold in our results tables.
In our experiments, we first look at the post
classification task in isolation (i.e. we predict
which labels to associate with each post, under-
specifying which posts those labels relate to). We
then move on to look at the link classification task,
again in isolation (i.e. we predict which previous
posts each post links to, underspecifying the na-
ture of the link). Finally, we perform preliminary
investigation of the joint task of DA and link clas-
sification, by incorporating DA class features into
the link classification task.
6 DA Classification Results
Our first experiment is based on post-level dia-
logue act (DA) classification, ignoring link struc-
ture in the first instance. That is, we predict the
labels on edges emanating from each post in the
DAG representation of the post structure, without

structural features (above-baseline results in bold)
specifying the edge destination. Returning to our
example in Figure 2, e.g., the gold-standard clas-
sification for Post 1 would be Q-Q, Post 2 would
be A-A, etc.
As a baseline for DA classification, simple ma-
jority voting attains an F-score of 0.403, based on
the A-A class. A more realistic baseline, how-
ever, is a position-conditioned variant, where the
first post is always classified as Q-Q, and all sub-
sequent posts are classified as A-A, achieving an
F-score of 0.641.
6.1 Lexical and structural features
First, we experiment with lexical and structural
features (recalling that we are unable to scale the
CRF model to full lexical features). Lexical fea-
tures produce below-baseline performance, while
simple structural features immediately lead to an
improvement over the baseline for CRF and ME.
The reason for the poor performance with lex-
ical features is that our dataset contains only
around 1300 posts, each of which is less than 100
words in length on average. The models are sim-
ply unable to generalise over this small amount of
data, and in the case of SVM-HMM, the presence
of lexical features, if anything, appears to obscure
the structured nature of the labelling task (i.e. the
classifier is unable to learn the simple heuristic
used by the modified majority class baseline).
The success of the structural features, on the
other hand, points to the presence of predictable
sequences of post labels in the data. That SVM-
HMM is unable to achieve baseline performance
with structural features is slightly troubling.
6.2 Post context features
Next, we test the two post context features: Previ-
ous Post (P) and Previous Post from Same Author
(A). Given the success of structural features, we
retain these in our experiments. Note that the la-
bels used in the post context are those which are
interactively learned by that model for the previ-
ous posts.

tures combined with DA-based post context; we
do not present any combinations of Previous Post
and Full History, as Full History includes the Pre-
vious Post.
Comparing back to the original results using
only the structural results, we can observe that Pre-
vious Post from Same Author and Full History (A
and F, resp., in the table) lead to a slight incre-
ment in F-score for both CRF and SVM-HMM,
but degrade the performance of ME. Previous Post
leads to either a marginal improvement, or a drop
in results, most noticeably for ME. It is slightly
surprising that the CRF should benefit from con-
text features at all, given that it is optimising over
the full tag sequence, but the impact is relatively
localised, and when all sets of context features
are used, the combined weight of noisy features
appears to swamp the learner, leading to a sharp
degradation in F-score.
6.3 Semantic features
We next investigate the relative impact of the se-
mantic features, once again including structural
features in all experiments. Table 3 presents the F-
score using the different combinations of semantic
features.
Similarly to the post context features, the se-
mantic features produced slight increments over
the structural features in isolation, especially for
CRF and ME. For the first time, SVM-HMM
achieved above-baseline results, when incorporat-
ing title similarity and post characteristics. Of the
individual semantic features, title and post simi-
larity appear to be the best performers. Slightly
disappointingly, the combination of semantic fea-
tures generally led to a degradation in F-score, al-
most certainly due to data sparseness. The best
overall result was achieved with CRF, incorporat-

ing structural features and title similarity, at an F-
score of 0.751.
To further explore the interaction between post
context and semantic features, we built CRF clas-
sifiers for different combinations of post context
and semantic features, and present the results in
Table 4.5 We achieved moderate gains in F-score,
with all post context features, in combination with
structural features, post similarity and post char-
acteristics achieving an F-score of 0.753, slightly
higher than the best result achieved for just struc-
tural and post context features.
It is important to refer back to the results for
lexical features (comparable to what would have
been achieved with a standard text categorisation
approach to the task), and observe that we have
achieved far higher F-scores using features cus-
tomised to user forum data. It is also important
to reflect that post context (in terms of the features
and the structured classification results of CRF)
appears to markedly improve our results, contrast-
ing with the results of Ries (1999) and Serafin and
Di Eugenio (2004).

sons of space, but there is relatively little deviation from the
numbers presented.

7 Link Classification Results
Our second experiment is based on link classifi-
cation in isolation. Here, we predict unlabelled
edges, e.g. in Figure 2, the gold-standard classifi-
cation for Post 1 would be NULL, Post 2 would be
Post 1, Post 3 would be Post 1, etc.
Note that the initial post cannot link to any other
post, and also that the second post always links
to the first post. As this is a hard constraint on
the data, and these posts simply act to inflate the
overall numbers, we exclude all first and second
posts from our evaluation of link classification.
We experimented with a range of baselines as
presented in Table 5, but found that the best per-
former by far was the simple heuristic of linking
each post (except for the initial post) to its imme-
diately preceding post. This leads to an F-score of
0.631, comparable to that for the post classifica-
tion task.
7.1 Lexical and structural features
Once again, we started by exploring the effective-
ness of lexical and structural features using the
three learners, as detailed in Table 6.
Similarly to the results for post classification,

structural features are more effective than lexical
features for link classification, but this time, nei-
ther feature set approaches the baseline F-score
for any of the learners. Once again, the results for
SVM-HMM are well below those for the other two
learners.
7.2 Post context features
Next, we experiment with link-based post con-
text features, in combination with the structural
features, as the results were found to be consis-
tently better when combined with the structural
features (despite the below-baseline performance
of the structural features in this case). The link-
based post context features in all cases are gener-
ated using the CRF with structural features from
Table 6. As before, we do not present any combi-
nations of Previous Post and Full History, as Full
History includes the Previous Post
As seen in Table 9, here, for the first time, we
achieve an above-baseline result for link classifi-
cation, for SVM and ME based on Previous Post
from Same Author in isolation, and also some-
times in combination with the other feature sets.
The results for CRF also improve, but not to a
level of statistical significance over the baseline.
Similarly to the results for DA classification, the
results for CRF drop appreciably when we com-
bine feature sets.
7.3 Semantic features
Finally, we experiment with semantic features,
once again in combination with structural features.
The results are presented in Table 8.
The results for semantic features largely mir-

Profile?; above-baseline results in bold)
ror those for post classification: small improve-
ments are observed for title similarity with CRF,
but otherwise, the results degrade across the board,
and the combination of different feature sets com-
pounds this effect.
The best overall result achieved for link classifi-
cation is thus the 0.743 for CRF with the structural
and post context features.
We additionally experimented with combina-
tions of features as for post classification, but were
unable to improve on this result.
7.4 Link Classification using DA Features
Ultimately, we require both DA and link classifica-
tion of each post, which is possible by combining
the outputs of the component classifiers described

above, by rolling the two tasks into a single clas-
sification task, or alternatively by looking to joint
modelling methods. As a preliminary step in this
direction, and means of exploring the interaction
between the two tasks, we repeat the experiment
based on post context features from above (see
Section 7.2), but rather than using link-based post
context, we use DA-based post context.
As can be seen in Table 9, the results for SVM-
HMM and ME drop appreciably as compared to
the results using link-based post context in Table 9,
while the results for CRF jump to the highest level
achieved for the task for all three learners. The
effect can be ascribed to the ability of CRF to
natively model the (bidirectional) link classifica-
tion history in the process of performing structured
learning, and the newly-introduced post features
complementing the link classification task.
8 Discussion and Future Work
Ultimately, we require both DA and link classifica-
tion of each post, which is possible in (at least) the
following three ways: (1) by combining the out-
puts of the component classifiers described above;
(2) by rolling the two tasks into a single classifi-
cation task; or (3) by looking to joint modelling
methods. Our results in Section 7.4 are suggestive
of the empirical potential of performing the two
tasks jointly, which we hope to explore in future
work.
One puzzling effect observed in our experi-
ments was the generally poor results for SVM. Er-
ror analysis indicates that the classifier was heav-
ily biased towards the high-frequency classes, e.g.
classifying all posts as either Q-Q or A-A for DA
classification. The classifications for the other two
learners were much more evenly spread across the
different classes.
CRF was limited in that it was unable to cap-
ture lexical features, but ultimately, lexical fea-
tures were found to be considerably less effec-
tive than structural and post context features for
both tasks, and the ability of the CRF to opti-
mise the post labelling over the full sequence of
posts in a thread more than compensated for this
shortcoming. Having said this, there is more work
to be done exploring synergies between the dif-
ferent feature sets, especially for DA classifica-
tion where all feature sets were found to produce
above-baseline results.
Another possible direction for future research is
to explore the impact of inter-post time on link
structure, based on the observation that follow-
up posts from the initiator tend to be tempo-
rally adjacent to posts they respond to with rela-
tively short time intervals, while posts from non-
initiators which are well spaced out tend not to re-
spond to one another. Combining this with pro-
filing of the cross-thread behaviour of individual
forum participants (Weimer et al, 2007; Lui and
Baldwin, 2009), and formal modelling of ?forum
behaviour? is also a promising line of research,
taking the lead from the work of Go?tz et al (2009),
inter alia.
9 Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed a method for
analysing post-to-post discourse structure in on-
line user forum data, in the form of post link-
ing and dialogue act tagging. We introduced
three feature sets: structural features, post con-
text features and semantic features. We exper-
imented with three learners (maximum entropy,
SVM-HMM and CRF), and established that CRF
is the superior approach to the task, achieving
above-baseline results for both post and link clas-
sification. We also demonstrated the complemen-
tarity of the proposed feature sets, especially for
the post classification task, and carried out a pre-
liminary exploration of the interaction between the
linking and dialogue act tagging tasks.
