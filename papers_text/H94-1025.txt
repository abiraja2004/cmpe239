ABSTRACT 
This paper describes asemi-automatic method for associating 
a Japanese lexicon with a semantic oncept taxonomy called 
an ontology, using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary as 
a "bridge". The ontology supports emantic processing in 
a knowledge-based machine translation system by providing 
a set of language-neutral symbols and semantic information. 
To put the ontology to practical use, lexical items of each 
language of interest must be linked to appropriate ontology 
items. The association of ontology items with lexical items 
of various languages i a process fraught with difficulty: since 
much of this work depends on the subjective decisions of hu- 
man workers, large MT dictionaries tend to be subject o 
some dispersion and inconsistency. The problem we focus 
on here is how to associate concepts in the ontology with 
Japanese lexical entities by automatic methods, since it is 
too difficult to define adequately many concepts manually. 
We have designed three algorithms to associate a Japanese 
lexicon with the concepts of the ontology automatically: the 
equivalent-word match, the argument match, and the exam- 
ple match. We simulated these algorithms for 980 nouns, 860 
verbs and 520 adjectives as preliminary experiments. The al- 
gorithms axe found to be effective for more than 80% of the 
words. 
1. In t roduct ion  
This paper describes a semi-automatic method for asso- 
ciating a Japanese lexicon with a semantic oncept ax- 
onomy using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary as 
a "bridge", in order to support semantic processing in a 
knowledge-based machine translation (MT) system. 
To enhance the semantic processing in MT systems, 
many system include conceptual networks called ontolo- 
gies or semantic taxonomies \[Bateman, 1990; Carlson 
and Nirenburg, 1990; Hovy and Knight, 1993; Klavans 
et al, 1990; Klavans et al, 1991; Knight, 1993\]. These 
ontologies house the representation symbols used by the 
analyzer and generator. To put the ontologies to practi- 
cal use, lexical items of each language of interest should 
be linked to appropriate ontology items. To support ex- 
tensibility to new languages, the MT ontology should 
be language-neutral, if not language-independent\[Hovy 
and Nirenburg, 1992\]. However, the construction of 
language-neutral ontologies, and the association of on- 
tology items with lexical items of various languages, are 
processes fraught with difficulty. Much of this work de- 
pends on the subjective decisions of more than one hu- 
man workers. Therefore, large MT dictionaries tend to 
be subject to some dispersion and inconsistency. Many 
translation errors are due to these dictionary problems, 
because the quality of the MT dictionaries are essential 
for the translation process. If possible, the dictionary 
quality should be controlled by automatic algorithms 
during the process of development to suppress disper- 
sions and inconsistencies, even if the final check should 
be entrusted to the human workers. 
Another motivation for the development of automated 
dictionary/ontology alignment algorithms is the in- 
creased availability of online lexical and semantic re- 
sources, such as lexicons, taxonomies, dictionaries and 
thesaiuri\[Matsumoto e  al., 1993b; Miller, 1990; Lenat 
and Guha, 1990; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Collins, 
1971; IPAL, 1987\]. Making the best use of such resources 
leads to higher quality translation with lower develop- 
ment cost\[Hovy and Knight, 1993; Knight, 1994; Hovy 
and Nirenburg, 1992\]. For example, the JUMAN sys- 
tem provides a Japanese unilingual lexicon for analyzing 
Japanese texts\[Matsumoto et al, 1993b\]. The linkage 
of the unilingual lexicon to the ontology directly en- 
ables Japanese-English translation with lower develop- 
ment cost. From this viewpoint, automatic alignment 
algorithms represent a new paradigm for MT system 
building. 
The problem we focus on here is how to associate con- 
cepts in the ontology with Japanese lexicM entities by 
automatic methods, since it is too difficult to define ad- 
equately many concepts manually. We have designed 
three algorithms to associate a Japanese lexicon with the 
concepts of the ontology automatically: the equivMent- 
word match, the argument match, and the example 
match, by employing a Japanese-English bilingual dic- 
tionary as a "bridge". The algorithms make it possible 
to link the unilingual exicons uch as JUMAN with the 
ontology for the development of a Japanese-English MT 
system. 
141 
First, we describe three linguistic resources for develop- 
ing the Japanese-English MT system: the ontology, the 
Japanese lexicon, and the bilingual dictionary. Next, we 
describe the automatic oncept association algorithms 
for creating the MT dictionary. Finally, we report the 
results of the algorithms as well as future work. 
2. Linguistic Resources 
2.1. Ontology 
At USC/ISI, we have been constructing an ontology, a
large-scale conceptual network, for three main purposes 
with the PAngloss MT system, which we are building 
together with CMT and NMSU. The first is to define 
the interlingua constituents, which comprise the seman- 
tic meanings of the input sentences independent of the 
source and target languages. They are defined in the 
ontology as concepts that represent commonly encoun- 
tered objects, entities, qualities, and relations. As the re- 
sult of analyzing the input text, our MT system parsers 
produce interlingua representation using the concepts. 
The second purpose is to describe semantic onstraints 
among concepts in the ontology, which works to support 
the analysis and generation processes of the MT sys- 
tem. The third purpose is to act as a common unifying 
framework among the lexical items of the various lan- 
guages. The ontology is being semi-automatically con- 
structed from the lexical database WordNet\[Miller, 1990\] 
and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
(LDOCE)\[Knight, 1993\]. At the current ime, the ontol- 
ogy contains over 70,000 items. English lexical items are 
associated with over 98% of the ontology. The ontology 
is also being linked to a lexicon of Spanish words, using 
the Collins Spanish-English bilingual dictionary. In our 
work, it is being linked to the Japanese lexicon devel- 
oped for the JUMAN word identification and morphol- 
ogy system\[Matsumoto et al, 1993b\] by the algorithms 
described in this paper. 
The ontology consists of three regions: the upper re- 
gion (more abstract), the middle region, and the lower 
(domain specific) region. The upper region of the on- 
tology is called the Ontology Base (OB) and contains 
approximately 400 items that represent generalizations 
essential for the various modules' linguistic processing 
during translation. The middle region of the ontology, 
approximately 50,000 items, provides a framework for a 
generic world model, containing items representing many 
English and other word senses. The lower regions of the 
ontology provide anchor points for different application 
domains. Both the middle and domain model regions of 
the ontology house the open-class terms of the MT in- 
terlingua. They also contain specific information used to 
screen unlikely semantic and anaphoric interpretations.

2.2. Japanese Lexicon 
At USC/ISI, we employ the JUMAN morphologi- 
cal analyzer and the SAX parser for Japanese pars- 
ing\[Matsumoto et al, 1993b; Matsumoto et al, 
1993a\]. These two modules use a lexicon of appro- 
priate 100,000 Japanese words. The lexicon contains 
spelling/orthography forms, morphological information, 
and part-of-speech annotations. To be useful for MT, the 
Japanese words should contain English wordsense equiv- 
alents or semantic definitions. We provide this informa- 
tion required for linking JUMAN lexicon to the ontology 
concepts by employing a Japanese-English bilingual dic- 
tionary as a "bridge" .
2.3. Bilingual Dictionary 
To link the unilingual Japanese JUMAN lexicon to the 
ontology, we employ a Japanese-English bilingual dictio- 
nary. This dictionary contains 75,000 words, providing 
Japanese-English word correspondences as hown in Fig- 
ure 1. It is not difficult to link JUMAN lexical entries 
with the Japanese lexical items of the bilingual dictio- 
nary by a simple string matching. Our problem is: how 
can we automatically find the appropriate ontology item 
corresponding to each Japanese lexical item, if any ? 
Since we assume that there is at least one sense shared by 
a Japanese word jw i  and the equivalent English words, 
ewlt ,  ew12, .... ew U, we define it as the bilingual con- 
cept JWi_O01. A bilingual concept JW i -k  is assigned to 
the kth correspondence pair. For each bilingual concept, 
we have extracted from the dictionary lists of the lexical 
information ecessary for MT processing the Japanese 
word entry, including its definition, parts of speech, syn- 
tactic and semantic onstraints for the arguments, En- 
glish equivalent words including synonyms, and bilingual 
example sentences. The lexical ists indexed by the bilin- 
gual concept are shown in Figure 2. 
For each bilingual concept, we replace information writ- 
ten in Japanese (such as the Japanese definition) by lists 
of English words for each Japanese word, by applying 
Japanese morphological nalysis and the bilingual dic- 
tionary. Hereby we gain, for each Japanese word in the 
JUMAN lexicon that also appears in the bilingual dictio-

"hit a ball" "roll a ball"))

to link it to the ontology. 
3. Concept Association Algorithms 
There are four cases on associating ontology concepts 
and equivalent bilingual concepts: 
case-I Single to single association 
A bilingual concept leads to one equivalent En- 
glish word. The English word is linked to one 
ontology concept. Therefore, the bilingual con- 
cept is linked to one ontology concept as shown 
in Figure 3. 
case-II Single to multiple association 
A bilingual concept leads to one equivalent En- 
glish word. The English word is linked to sev- 
eral ontology concepts. Therefore, the bilingual 
concept is linked to several ontology concepts 
as shown in Figure 4. 
case-III Multiple to single association 
A bilingual concept leads to several equivalent 
English words. The English words are linked to 
one ontology concept. Therefore, the bilingual 
concept is linked to one ontology concept as 
shown in Figure 5. 
case-IV Multiple to multiple association 
A bilingual concept leads to several equivalent 
English words. Each English word is linked to 
several ontology concepts. Therefore, the bilin- 
gual concept is linked to several ontology con- 
cepts as shown in Figure 6.

case-IV. The equivalent-word match is designed for case- 
IV. The argument match and the example match are de- 
signed for case-II and for complementing the equivalent- 
word match. 
3.1.  Equ iva lent -word  Match  
The equivalent-word match algorithm is based on the al- 
gorithm developed by K.Knight for merging LDOCE and 
WordNet\[Knight, 1993\] and Knight's bilingual match 
algorithm\[Knight, 1994\]. The equivalent-word match 
searches for concept equivalencies by performing an in- 
tersection operation on all ontology concepts linked to 
the English equivalent words of the bilingual concept. 
Higher confidence is assigned to the concepts whose part 
of speech corresponds to the ontology type. For exam- 
ple, the Japanese noun "Tama" has nine senses in the 
dictionary. One of these senses is shown in Figure 7. 
The bilingual-concept TAMA-001 is represented by two 
English words: "ball" and "globe" . There are respec- 
tively six and three concepts for "ball" and "globe" in 
the ontology as shown in Figure 8. By intersecting the 
ontology concepts for a ball with the ontology concepts 
for a globe, TAMA_001 can be associated with the ontol- 
ogy concept balL0_1 with a fairly high level of confidence.. 
3.2. Argument  Match  
The argument match collates Japanese argument con- 
straints with ontology argument constraints. The ar- 
gument match complements the equivalent-word match, 
because not all the lists contain two or more English 
equivalent words. For example, the Japanese verb "ut- 
susu" has five senses in the dictionary. One of these 
senses is shown in Figure 9. There are three concepts 
linked to "infect" in the ontology as shown in Figure 
10. Ontology concept infect_0_2 contains an argument 
constraint such as "Somebody infects somebody with 
Case-I and case-III provide single associations between 
the bilingual concepts and the ontology concepts, which 
are simple. The problem is to associate the ontology con- 
cepts with equivalent bilingual concepts for case-II and

Figure 9: One bilingual concept for "Utsusu"

gument constraints, the ontology concept infect_0_2 is 
found to contain similar argument constraints to the 
bilingual concept UTSUSU..004. The algorithm assigns 
higher confidence to the association of OTSUSU_004 and 
infect_O_2. 
3.3. Example Match 
In order to complement the above two matches, the ex- 
ample match Mgorithm compares the bilingual examples 
with the ontology examples and definition sentences. By 
measuring the similarity of both examples, the algorithm 
determines the similarity of concepts. For example, the 
Japanese noun "ginkou" has one sense in the dictionary. 
The sense is shown in Figure 11. There are four con- 
cepts linked to "bank" in the ontology as shown in Fig- 
ure 12. The algorithm calculates the similarity of two 
word-sets (the words contained in the bilingual exam- 
ples and the words contained in the ontology examples 
and definition sentence) by simply intersecting the two 
sets of words after transforming them to canonical dic- 
tionary entry forms and removing function words. In 
the case of GINKOU-001 example set and bank exam- 
ple sets, GINKOU-001 and bank_0.3 share the maximum 
number of words: "deposit" and "money". As a result, 
GINKOU_001 is highly associated with the ontology con- 
cept bank_0_3. 
4. Results 
We simulated these algorithms for 980 nouns, 860 verbs 
and 520 adjectives in a preliminary experiment. Half of 
the words belong to case-II and the other half to case- 
IV. The algorithms are applied according to the following 
procedure: 
(Bilingual-concept TAMA_001 
(Japanese-word "tams" ) 
(Japanese-definition "a spherical object") 
(Japanese-part-of-speech Noun ) 
(English-equivalent-words % ball" % globe") 
(Examples "throw a ball" "catch a ball" 
"hit a ball" "roll a ball"))

The algorithms are found to be effective for more than 
80% of the words, thereby helping to reduce the dictio- 
nary development costs of human workers. 
5. D iscuss ion  
In order to get better esults, we are now improving the 
ratio of the open words and the close words from the 
following three viewpoints. 
1. Semantic distance measurement 
To reduce the number of open words, the example 
match is being improved by using a more sophisti- 
cated algorithm for the semantic distance measured 
in the ontology\[Resnik, 1993; Knight, 1993\]. This 
measurement is also useful for improving the argu- 
ment match, because the argument constraints are 
often described by the specific examples. In this 
case, the semantic distance measurement algorithm 
helps to determine whether the bilingual argument 
constraints are identical with the ontology argument 
constraints or not. 
2. Other lexicons and databases 
For further improvement, other lexicons should be 
exploited. The open words usually are high ambi- 
guity words with little information in the bilingual 
dictionary that have one equivalent English word 
with many meanings, with little constraint infor- 
mation and few examples. To compensate for the 
lack of information, we are now referring to other 
bilingual dictionaries and Japanese lexicons. 
3. Integration of the three algorithms 
To reduce the number of close words, one integrated 
algorithm is being designed. By using the semantic 
distance measurement algorithm, one matching de- 
gree can be defined for both argument match and 
example match. Though the current equivalent- 
word match provides a high confidence only when all 
English-equivalent words share ontology concepts, 
we define the matching degree according to the num- 
ber of English-equivalent words which can share on- 
tology concepts. For example, when two of three 
English-equivalent words share an ontology concept 
EW~j_I_I and the other English-equivalent word is 
linked to an ontology concept EWkj-2-1, a match- 
ing degree 0.66 is assigned to the association with 
EWkj _1_1, and a matching degree 0.33 to EWkj ..2_1.

We determine the optimal weights for the .three 
matching degrees based on the data used for simu- 
lation so that the integration algorithm can provide 
the most plausible association for the open words. 
As well as improving these points, we are applying the 
algorithms to more words and other parts of speech. We 
plan to apply the algorithms to other bilingual dictio- 
naries such as Chinese-English in order to increase the 
sophistication of the ontology for our multilingual MT 
system.
