Abstract
This paper describes the joint submis-
sion of the QUAERO project for the
German?English translation task of the
ACL 2013 Eighth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (WMT 2013).
The submission was a system combina-
tion of the output of four different transla-
tion systems provided by RWTH Aachen
University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy (KIT), LIMSI-CNRS and SYSTRAN
Software, Inc. The translations were
joined using the RWTH?s system com-
bination approach. Experimental results
show improvements of up to 1.2 points in
BLEU and 1.2 points in TER compared to
the best single translation.
1 Introduction
QUAERO is a European research and develop-
ment program with the goal of developing multi-
media and multilingual indexing and management
tools for professional and general public applica-
tions (http://www.quaero.org). Research in ma-
chine translation is mainly assigned to the four
groups participating in this joint submission. The
aim of this submission was to show the quality of
a joint translation by combining the knowledge of
the four project partners. Each group develop and
maintain their own different machine translation
system. These single systems differ not only in
their general approach, but also in the preprocess-
ing of training and test data. To take advantage
of these differences of each translation system, we
combined all hypotheses of the different systems,
using the RWTH system combination approach.
This paper is structured as follows. First, the
different engines of all four groups are introduced.
In Section 3, the RWTH Aachen system combina-
tion approach is presented. Experiments with dif-
ferent system selections for system combination
are described in Section 4. This paper is concluded
in Section 5.
2 Translation Systems
For WMT 2013, each QUAERO partner trained
their systems on the parallel Europarl (EPPS),
News Commentary (NC) corpora and the web-
crawled corpus. All single systems were tuned on
the newstest2009 and newstest2010 development
set. The newstest2011 development set was used
to tune the system combination parameters. Fi-
nally, on newstest2012 the results of the different
system combination settings are compared. In this
Section, all four different translation engines are
presented.
2.1 RWTH Aachen Single System
For the WMT 2013 evaluation, RWTH utilized a
phrase-based decoder based on (Wuebker et al,
2012) which is part of RWTH?s open-source SMT
toolkit Jane 2.1 1. GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)
was employed to train a word alignment, language
models have been created with the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002).
After phrase pair extraction from the word-
aligned parallel corpus, the translation probabil-
ities are estimated by relative frequencies. The
standard feature set alo includes an n-gram lan-
guage model, phrase-level IBM-1 and word-,
phrase- and distortion-penalties, which are com-
bined in log-linear fashion. Furthermore, we used
an additional reordering model as described in
(Galley and Manning, 2008). By this model six

additional feature are added to the log-linear com-
bination. The model weights are optimized with
standard Mert (Och, 2003a) on 200-best lists. The
optimization criterion is BLEU.
2.1.1 Preprocessing
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size trans-
lation, the German text was preprocessed by split-
ting German compound words with the frequency-
based method described in (Koehn and Knight,
2003). To further reduce translation complexity
for the phrase-based approach, we performed the
long-range part-of-speech based reordering rules
proposed by (Popovic? et al, 2006).
2.1.2 Translation Model
We applied filtering and weighting for domain-
adaptation similarly to (Mansour et al, 2011) and
(Mansour and Ney, 2012). For filtering the bilin-
gual data, a combination of LM and IBM Model
1 scores was used. In addition, we performed
weighted phrase extraction by using a combined
LM and IBM Model 1 weight.
2.1.3 Language Model
During decoding a 4-gram language model is ap-
plied. The language model is trained on the par-
allel data as well as the provided News crawl,
the 109 French-English, UN and LDC Gigaword
Fourth Edition corpora.
2.2 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Single
System
2.2.1 Preprocessing
The training data was preprocessed prior to the
training. Symbols such as quotes, dashes and
apostrophes are normalized. Then the first words
of each sentence are smart-cased. For the Ger-
man part of the training corpus, the hunspell2 lex-
icon was used, in order to learn a mapping from
old German spelling to new German writing rules.
Compound-splitting was also performed as de-
scribed in Koehn and Knight (2003). We also re-
moved very long sentences, empty lines, and sen-
tences which show big mismatch on the length.
2.2.2 Filtering
The web-crawled corpus was filtered using an
SVM classifier as described in (Mediani et al,
2011). The lexica used in this filtering task were
obtained from Giza alignments trained on the
2http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/
cleaner corpora, EPPS and NC. Assuming that this
corpus is very noisy, we biased our classifier more
towards precision than recall. This was realized
by giving higher number of false examples (80%
of the training data).
This filtering technique ruled out more than
38% of the corpus (the unfiltered corpus contains
around 2.4M pairs, 0.9M of which were rejected
in the filtering task).
2.2.3 System Overview
The in-house phrase-based decoder (Vogel, 2003)
is used to perform decoding. Optimization with
regard to the BLEU score is done using Minimum
Error Rate Training (MERT) as described in Venu-
gopal et al (2005).
2.2.4 Reordering Model
We applied part-of-speech (POS) based reordering
using probabilistic continuous (Rottmann and Vo-
gel, 2007) and discontinuous (Niehues and Kolss,
2009) rules. This was learned using POS tags gen-
erated by the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for short
and long range reorderings respectively.
In addition to this POS-based reordering, we
also used tree-based reordering rules. Syntactic
parse trees of the whole training corpus and the
word alignment between source and target lan-
guage are used to learn rules on how to reorder the
constituents in a German source sentence to make
it match the English target sentence word order
better (Herrmann et al, 2013). The training corpus
was parsed by the Stanford parser (Rafferty and
Manning, 2008). The reordering rules are applied
to the source sentences and the reordered sentence
variants as well as the original sequence are en-
coded in a word lattice which is used as input to
the decoder.
Moreover, our reordering model was extended
so that it could include the features of lexicalized
reordering model. The reordering probabilities for
each phrase pair are stored as well as the origi-
nal position of each word in the lattice. During
the decoding, the reordering origin of the words
is checked along with its probability added as an
additional score.
2.2.5 Translation Models
The translation model uses the parallel data of
EPPS, NC, and the filtered web-crawled data. As
word alignment, we used the Discriminative Word
Alignment (DWA) as shown in (Niehues and Vo-
186
gel, 2008). The phrase pairs were extracted using
different source word order suggested by the POS-
based reordering models presented previously as
described in (Niehues et al, 2009).
In order to extend the context of source lan-
guage words, we applied a bilingual language
model (Niehues et al, 2011). A Discriminative
Word Lexicon (DWL) introduced in (Mauser et
al., 2009) was extended so that it could take the
source context also into the account. For this,
we used a bag-of-ngrams instead of representing
the source sentence as a bag-of-words. Filtering
based on counts was then applied to the features
for higher order n-grams. In addition to this, the
training examples were created differently so that
we only used the words that occur in the n-best list
but not in the reference as negative example.
2.2.6 Language Models
We build separate language models and combined
them prior to decoding. As word-token based
language models, one language model is built on
EPPS, NC, and giga corpus, while another one is
built using crawled data. We combined the LMs
linearly by minimizing the perplexity on the de-
velopment data. As a bilingual language model we
used the EPPS, NC, and the web-crawled data and
combined them. Furthermore, we use a 5-gram
cluster-based language model with 1,000 word
clusters, which was trained on the EPPS and NC
corpus. The word clusters were created using the
MKCLS algorithm.
2.3 LIMSI-CNRS Single System
2.3.1 System overview
LIMSI?s system is built with n-code (Crego et al,
2011), an open source statistical machine transla-
tion system based on bilingual n-gram3. In this
approach, the translation model relies on a spe-
cific decomposition of the joint probability of a
sentence pair using the n-gram assumption: a sen-
tence pair is decomposed into a sequence of bilin-
gual units called tuples, defining a joint segmen-
tation of the source and target. In the approach of
(Marin?o et al, 2006), this segmentation is a by-
product of source reordering which ultimately de-
rives from initial word and phrase alignments.
2.3.2 An overview of n-code
The baseline translation model is implemented as
a stochastic finite-state transducer trained using
3http://ncode.limsi.fr/
a n-gram model of (source,target) pairs (Casacu-
berta and Vidal, 2004). Training this model re-
quires to reorder source sentences so as to match
the target word order. This is performed by
a stochastic finite-state reordering model, which
uses part-of-speech information4 to generalize re-
ordering patterns beyond lexical regularities.
In addition to the translation model, eleven fea-
ture functions are combined: a target-language
model; four lexicon models; two lexicalized re-
ordering models (Tillmann, 2004) aiming at pre-
dicting the orientation of the next translation unit;
a ?weak? distance-based distortion model; and
finally a word-bonus model and a tuple-bonus
model which compensate for the system prefer-
ence for short translations. The four lexicon mod-
els are similar to the ones use in a standard phrase
based system: two scores correspond to the rel-
ative frequencies of the tuples and two lexical
weights estimated from the automatically gener-
ated word alignments. The weights associated to
feature functions are optimally combined using a
discriminative training framework (Och, 2003b).
The overall search is based on a beam-search
strategy on top of a dynamic programming algo-
rithm. Reordering hypotheses are computed in a
preprocessing step, making use of reordering rules
built from the word reorderings introduced in the
tuple extraction process. The resulting reordering
hypotheses are passed to the decoder in the form
of word lattices (Crego and Mario, 2006).
2.3.3 Continuous space translation models
One critical issue with standard n-gram translation
models is that the elementary units are bilingual
pairs, which means that the underlying vocabu-
lary can be quite large, even for small translation
tasks. Unfortunately, the parallel data available to
train these models are typically order of magni-
tudes smaller than the corresponding monolingual
corpora used to train target language models. It is
very likely then, that such models should face se-
vere estimation problems. In such setting, using
neural network language model techniques seem
all the more appropriate. For this study, we fol-
low the recommendations of Le et al (2012), who
propose to factor the joint probability of a sen-
tence pair by decomposing tuples in two (source
and target) parts, and further each part in words.
This yields a word factored translation model that

puted using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995).

can be estimated in a continuous space using the
SOUL architecture (Le et al, 2011).
The design and integration of a SOUL model for
large SMT tasks is far from easy, given the com-
putational cost of computing n-gram probabilities.
The solution used here was to resort to a two pass
approach: the first pass uses a conventional back-
off n-gram model to produce a k-best list; in the
second pass, the k-best list is reordered using the
probabilities of m-gram SOUL translation models.
In the following experiments, we used a fixed con-
text size for SOUL of m= 10, and used k = 300.
2.3.4 Corpora and data pre-processing
All the parallel data allowed in the constrained
task are pooled together to create a single par-
allel corpus. This corpus is word-aligned using
MGIZA++5 with default settings. For the English
monolingual training data, we used the same setup
as last year6 and thus the same target language
model as detailed in (Allauzen et al, 2011).
For English, we also took advantage of our in-
house text processing tools for the tokenization
and detokenization steps (Dchelotte et al, 2008)
and our system is built in ?true-case?. As Ger-
man is morphologically more complex than En-
glish, the default policy which consists in treat-
ing each word form independently is plagued with
data sparsity, which is detrimental both at training
and decoding time. Thus, the German side was
normalized using a specific pre-processing scheme
(described in (Allauzen et al, 2010; Durgar El-
Kahlout and Yvon, 2010)), which notably aims at
reducing the lexical redundancy by (i) normalizing
the orthography, (ii) neutralizing most inflections
and (iii) splitting complex compounds.
2.4 SYSTRAN Software, Inc. Single System
In the past few years, SYSTRAN has been focus-
ing on the introduction of statistical approaches
to its rule-based backbone, leading to Hybrid Ma-
chine Translation.
The technique of Statistical Post-Editing
(Dugast et al, 2007) is used to automatically edit
the output of the rule-based system. A Statistical
Post-Editing (SPE) module is generated from a
bilingual corpus. It is basically a translation mod-
ule by itself, however it is trained on rule-based
5http://geek.kyloo.net/software
6The fifth edition of the English Gigaword
(LDC2011T07) was not used.
translations and reference data. It applies correc-
tions and adaptations learned from a phrase-based
5-gram language model. Using this two-step
process will implicitly keep long distance re-
lations and other constraints determined by the
rule-based system while significantly improving
phrasal fluency. It has the advantage that quality
improvements can be achieved with very little
but targeted bilingual data, thus significantly
reducing training time and increasing translation
performance.
The basic setup of the SPE component is identi-
cal to the one described in (Dugast et al, 2007).
A statistical translation model is trained on the
rule-based translation of the source and the target
side of the parallel corpus. Language models are
trained on each target half of the parallel corpora
and also on additional in-domain corpora. More-
over, the following measures - limiting unwanted
statistical effects - were applied:
? Named entities are replaced by special tokens
on both sides. This usually improves word
alignment, since the vocabulary size is sig-
nificantly reduced. In addition, entity trans-
lation is handled more reliably by the rule-
based engine.
? The intersection of both vocabularies (i.e. vo-
cabularies of the rule-based output and the
reference translation) is used to produce an
additional parallel corpus (whose target is
identical to the source). This was added to the
parallel text in order to improve word align-
ment.
? Singleton phrase pairs are deleted from the
phrase table to avoid overfitting.
? Phrase pairs not containing the same number
of entities on the source and the target side
are also discarded.
? Phrase pairs appearing less than 2 times were
pruned.
The SPE language model was trained on 2M
phrases from the news/europarl and Common-
Crawl corpora, provided as training data for WMT
2013. Weights for these separate models were
tuned by the Mert algorithm provided in the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007), using the provided
news development set.

Figure 1: Confusion network of four different hypotheses.
3 RWTH Aachen System Combination
System combination is used to produce consen-
sus translations from multiple hypotheses gener-
ated with different translation engines. First, a
word to word alignment for the given single sys-
tem hypotheses is produced. In a second step a
confusion network is constructed. Then, the hy-
pothesis with the highest probability is extracted
from this confusion network. For the alignment
procedure, each of the given single systems gen-
erates one confusion network with its own as pri-
mary system. To this primary system all other hy-
potheses are aligned using the METEOR (Lavie
and Agarwal, 2007) alignment and thus the pri-
mary system defines the word order. Once the
alignment is given, the corresponding confusion
network is constructed. An example is given in
Figure 1. The final network for one source sen-
tence is the union of all confusion networks gen-
erated from the different primary systems. That
allows the system combination to select the word
order from different system outputs.
Before performing system combination, each
translation output was normalized by tokenization
and lowercasing. The output of the combination
was then truecased based on the original truecased
output.
The model weights of the system combination
are optimized with standard Mert (Och, 2003a)
on 100-best lists. We add one voting feature for
each single system to the log-linear framework of
the system combination. The voting feature fires
for each word the single system agrees on. More-
over, a word penalty, a language model trained on
the input hypotheses, a binary feature which pe-
nalizes word deletions in the confusion network
and a primary feature which marks the system
which provides the word order are combined in
this log-linear model. The optimization criterion
is 4BLEU-TER.
4 Experimental Results
In this year?s experiments, we tried to improve the
result of the system combination further by com-
bining single systems tuned on different develop-

ment sets. The idea is to achieve a more stable
performance in terms of translation quality, if the
single systems are not optimized on the same data
set. In Table 1, the results of each provided single
system tuned on newstest2009 and newstest2010
are shown. For RWTH, LIMSI and SYSTRAN,
it seems that the performance of the single system
depends on the chosen tuning set. However, the
translation quality of the single systems provided
by KIT is stable.
As initial approach and for the final submis-
sion, we grouped single systems with dissimilar
approaches. Thus, KIT (phrase-based SMT) and
SYSTRAN (rule-based MT) tuned their system on
newstest2010, while RWTH (phrase-based SMT)
and LIMSI (n-gram) optimized on newstest2009.
To compare the impact of this approach, all pos-
sible combinations were checked (Table 2). How-
ever, it seems that the translation quality can not be
improved by this approach. For the test set (new-
stest2012), BLEU is steady around 25.6 points.
Even if the single system with lowest BLEU are
combined (KIT 2010, LIMSI 2009, SYSTRAN
2010, RWTH 2009), the translation quality in
terms of BLEU is comparable with the combina-
tion of the best single systems (KIT 2009, LIMSI
2010, SYSTRAN 2010, RWTH 2010). However,
we could gain 1.0 point in TER.
Due to the fact, that for the final submission the
initial grouping was available only, we kept this

combination. To improve this baseline further, two
additional models were added. We applied lexi-
cal smoothing (IBM-1) and an additional language
model (bigLM) trained on the English side of the
parallel data and the News shuffle corpus. The re-
sults are presented in Table 3.
The baseline was slightly improved by 0.2
points in BLEU and TER. Note, this system com-
bination was the final submission.
5 Conclusion
For the participation in the WMT 2013 shared
translation task, the partners of the QUAERO
project (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, RWTH
Aachen University, LIMSI-CNRS and SYSTRAN
Software, Inc.) provided a joint submission. By
joining the output of four different translation sys-
tems with RWTH?s system combination, we re-
ported an improvement of up to 1.2 points in
BLEU and TER.
Combining systems optimized on different tun-
ing sets does not seem to improve the translation
quality. However, by adding additional model, the
baseline was slightly improved.
All in all, we conclude that the variability in
terms of BLEU does not influence the final result.
It seems that using different approaches of MT in
a system combination is more important (Freitag
et al, 2012).
