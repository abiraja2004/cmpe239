Abstract
There is a long history of research in automatic text
summarization systems by both the text retrieval
and the natural language processing communities,
but evaluation of such systems? output has always
presented problems. One critical problem remains
how to handle the unavoidable variability in hu-
man judgments at the core of all the evaluations.
Sponsored by the DARPA TIDES project, NIST
launched a new text summarization evaluation ef-
fort, called DUC, in 2001 with follow-on workshops
in 2002 and 2003. Human judgments provided the
foundation for all three evaluations and this paper
examines how the variation in those judgments does
and does not affect the results and their interpreta-
tion.
1 Introduction
Research in summarization was one of the first ef-
forts to use computers to ?understand? language.
Work was done back in the 1950s by many groups,
including commercial services, to automatically
produce abstracts or lists of pertinent keywords for
documents. The interest in automatic summariza-
tion of text has continued, and currently is enjoy-
ing increased emphasis as demonstrated by the nu-
merous summarization workshops held during the
last five years. The DUC summarization evalu-
ations (2001 ? 2004)(http://duc.nist.gov)
sponsored by the DARPA TIDES project (Translin-
gual Information Detection, Extraction, and Sum-
marization) are prominent examples. DUC has been
guided by a roadmap developed by members of the
summarization research community.
Along with the research has come efforts to eval-
uate automatic summarization performance. Two
major types of evaluation have been used: extrinsic
evaluation, where one measures indirectly how well
the summary performs by measuring performance
in a task putatively dependent on the quality of the
summary, and intrinsic evaluation, where one mea-
sures the quality of the created summary directly.
Extrinsic evaluation requires the selection of a
task that could use summarization and measurement
of the effect of using automatic summaries instead
of the original text. Critical issues here are the se-
lection of a real task and the metrics that will be sen-
sitive to differences in the quality of the summaries.
This paper concerns itself with intrinsic evalua-
tions. Intrinsic evaluation requires some standard or
model against which to judge summarization qual-
ity and usually this standard is operationalized by
finding an existing abstract/text data set or by hav-
ing humans create model summaries (Jing et al,
1998).
Intrinsic evaluations have taken two main forms:
manual, in which one or more people evaluate the
system-produced summary and automatic, in which
the summary is evaluated without the human in the
loop. But both types involve human judgments of
some sort and with them their inherent variability.
Humans vary in what material they choose to in-
clude in a summary and in how they express the con-
tent. Humans judgments of summary quality vary
from one person to another and across time for one
person.
In DUC 2001 - 2003 human judgments have
formed the foundation of the evaluations and infor-
mation has been collected each year on one or more
sorts of variation in those judgments. The following
sections examine this information and how the vari-
ation in human input affected or did not affect the
results of those evaluations.
2 Initial Design ? DUC-2001
Since the roadmap specified testing in DUC-2001 of
both single and multi-document summarization, the
data sets and tasks were designed as follows.
Sixty sets of approximately 10 documents each
were provided as system input for this task. Given
such a set of documents, the systems were to au-
tomatically create a 100-word generic summary for
each document. Additionally they were to create a
generic summary of the entire set, one summary at
each of four target lengths (approximately 400, 200,
Figure 1: SEE interface for judging per unit cover-
age
100, and 50 words).
The sets of documents were assembled at NIST
by 10 retired information analysts. Each person se-
lected six document sets, and then created a 100-
word manual abstract for each document, and for
the entire document set at the 400, 200, 100 and
50 word lengths. Thirty of the sets (documents and
manual abstracts) were distributed as training data
and the remaining thirty sets of documents (without
abstracts) were distributed as test data.
Fifteen groups participated in DUC-2001, with
11 of them doing single document summarization
and 12 of them doing the multi-document task.
The evaluation plan as specified in the roadmap
was for NIST to concentrate on manual comparison
of the system results with the manually-constructed
abstracts. To this end a new tool was developed
by Chin-Yew Lin at the Information Sciences In-
stitute, University of Southern California (http:
//www.isi.edu/?cyl/SEE/). This tool al-
lows a summary to be rated in isolation as well as
compared to another summary for content overlap.
Figure 1 shows one example of this interface. Hu-
man evaluation was done at NIST using the same
personnel who created the manual abstracts (called
model summaries).
One type of evaluation supported by SEE was
coverage, i.e., how well did the peer summaries
(i.e., those being evaluated) cover the content of the
documents (as expressed by the model summary).
A pairwise summary comparison was used in this
part of the evaluation and judges were asked to do
detailed coverage comparisons. SEE allowed the
judges to step through predefined units of the model
summary (elementary discourse units/EDUs) (Sori-
cut and Marcu, 2003) and for each unit of that sum-
mary, mark the sentences in the peer summary that
expressed [all(4), most(3), some(2), hardly any(1)
or none(0)] of the content in the current model sum-
mary unit. The resulting ordered category scale[0-
4] is treated as an interval scale in the coverage score
based on feedback from the judges on how it was
used. The coverage score for a given peer summary
is the mean of its scores against the EDUs of the
associated model (? 4 EDUs per summary for the
50-word model summaries). This process is much
more complex than doing a simple overall compari-
son using the entire summary but past evaluation ex-
periences indicated that judges had more difficulty
making an overall decision than they did making de-
cisions at each EDU.
2.1 DUC-2001 Results - Effect of Variability in
Models
Recall that there are two very different sources of
human variation in DUC-2001, as in all the DUC
evaluations. The first is the disagreement among
judges as to how well a system summary covers the
model summary. This is similar to what is seen in
relevance assessment for IR evaluations. To the ex-
tent that different judges are consistently more le-
nient or strict, this problem has been handled in
DUC by having the same judge look at all sum-
maries for a given document set so that all peer sum-
maries are affected equally and by having enough
document sets to allow averaging over judges to
mitigate the effect of very strict or very lenient
judges. If a judge?s leniency varies inconsistently in
a way dependent on which system is being judged
(i.e., if there is an interaction between the judge and
the system), then other strategies are needed. (Data
was collected and analyzed in DUC-2002 to assess
the size of these interactions.)
Summarization has a second source of disagree-
ment and that is the model summaries themselves.
People write models that vary not only in writing
style, but also in focus, i.e., what is important to
summarize in a document or document set.
To shed light on variability in creation of models
and their use, each of the 30 document sets in the
test set (plus the 300 individual documents) were
summarized independently by three summarizers -
the one who had selected the documents plus two
others. These extra summaries were used as addi-
tional peer human summaries in the main evaluation
and also in a special study of the model effects on
evaluation.
This special study worked with a random subset
of 20 document sets (out of 30). Each peer was
judged twice more by a single person who had not
done the original judgment. This person used the
two extra models, neither of which had been created
by the person doing the judgments. There was only
time to do this for the multi-document summaries at
lengths 50 and 200.
2.2 Model Differences
A first question is how much did the two mod-
els differ. One way of measuring this is by a
simple n-gram overlap of the terms. This was
done based on software in the MEAD toolkit
(http://www.summarization.com), with-
out omitting the commonwords, nor doing any
stemming, and the n-grams were allowed to span
sentence boundaries. The average unigram overlap
(the number of unique unigrams in the intersec-
tion/the number of unique unigrams in the union)
for the two extra 50-word model summaries was
0.151 and there were only 6 out of the 20 sets that
had any tri-gram overlap at all. For the 200-word
summaries, the average unigram overlap was 0.197,
with 16 out of the 20 sets having tri-gram overlaps.
These numbers seem surprisingly low, but an
examination of the summaries illustrates some of
the reasons. What follows are the two model pairs
with the greatest and least unigram overlap in the
two extra 50-word document set group.
Document set 32, Judge G ?In March 1989,
an Exxon oil tanker crashed on a reef near Valdez,
Alaska, spilling 8.4 million gallons of oil into
Prince William Sound seriously damaging the
environment. The cleanup was slow and Exxon was
subject to severe compensation costs and indictment
by a federal jury on five criminal charges.?
Document set 32, Judge I ?On March 24, 1989, the
Exxon Valdez spilled 11.3 million gallons of crude
oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Cleanup of the
disaster continued until September and cost almost
$2 billion, but 117 miles of beach remained oily.
Exxon announced an earnings- drop in January
1990 and was ordered to resume cleaning on May
1.?
Document set 14, Judge B ?U.S. military air-
craft crashes occur throughout the world more
often than one might suspect. They are normally
reported in the press; however, only those involving
major damage or loss of life attract extensive media
coverage. Investigations are always conducted.

Document set 14, Judge H ?1988 crashes in-
cluded four F-16s, two F-14s, three A-10s, two
B-52s, two B-1Bs, and one tanker. In 1989 one T-2
trainer crashed. 1990 crashes included one F-16,
one F-111, one F-4, one C-5A, and 17 helicopters.
Other plane crashes occurred in 1975 (C-5B), 1984
(B-52), 1987 (F-16), and 1994 (F-15).?
For document set 32, the two model creators
are covering basically the same content, but are
including slightly different details (and therefore
words). But for document set 14, the two models
are written at very different levels of granularity,
with one person writing a very high-level analysis
whereas the other one gives only details. Note that
these are only examples of the variation seen across
the models; many other types of variations exist.
Additionally there is a wide variation in overlap
across the 20 document sets (see Figure 2). This
document set variation is confounded with the hu-
man variation in creating the models since there
were 6 different humans involved for the 20 doc-
ument sets.

Figure 3: DUC-2001 absolute coverage differences
by document set for the two extra 50-word models
dot the average, and the box comprises the middle 2
quartiles. The open circles are outliers.
There is a large variation across document sets,
with some sets having much wider ranges in cov-
erage score differences based on the two differ-
ent models. Looking across all 20 document sets,
the average absolute coverage difference is 0.437
or 47.8% of the highest scoring model for the 50-
word summaries and 0.318 (42.5%) for the 200-
word summaries. This large difference in scores is
coming solely from the model difference since judg-
ment is being made by the same person (although
some self-inconsistency is involved (Lin and Hovy,
2002)).
2.4 Relationship between Model Differences
and Coverage Scores
Does a small unigram overlap in terms for the mod-
els in a given document set predict a wide differ-
ence in coverage scores for peers judged against the
models in that document set? Comparing Figures 2
and 3, or indeed graphing overlap against coverage
(Figure 4) shows that there is little correlation be-
tween these two. One suspects that the humans are
able to compensate for different word choice and
that the coverage differences shown in Figure 3 rep-
resent differences in content in the models.
2.5 Effects of Model Differences on per System
Coverage Scores
How does the choice of model for each document
set affect the absolute and relative coverage score
for each system averaged across all document sets?

Figure 5: DUC-2001 median coverage by systems
using extra model sets (50-word summaries)
word summaries) for the 12 systems using each of
the two extra model sets. The points for the cov-
erage scores are connected within a given model to
make changes in rank with neighbors more obvious.
It can be seen that the scores are close to each other
in absolute value and that the two lines track each
other in general. (The same type of graph could be
shown for the 200-word summaries, but here there
were even smaller differences between system rank-
ings.)
What is being suggested (but not proven) by Fig-
ure 5 is that the large differences seen in the model
overlap are not reflected in the absolute or rela-
tive system results for the DUC-2001 data exam-
ined. Most of the systems judged better against one
set of models are still better using different models.
The correlation (Pearson?s) between median cover-
age scores for the systems using the two extra model
sets is 0.641 (p < 0.05). This surprising stability of
system rankings clearly needs further analysis be-
yond this paper, but implies that the use of enough
instances (document sets in this case) allows an av-
eraging effect to stablize rankings.
There are many system judgments going into
these averages, basically 20 document sets times
the average number of model units judged per doc-
ument set (? 4). These 80 measurements should
make the means of the extra scorings better es-
timates of the ?true? coverage and hence more
alike. More importantly, Figure 5 suggests that
there is minimal model/system interaction. Al-
though no analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run in
DUC-2001, the ANOVAs for DUCs 2002 and 2003
verify this lack of interaction.
3 DUC-2002
DUC-2002 was designed and evaluated in much
the same manner as DUC-2001 to allow continu-
ity of research and evaluation. There were 60 more
document sets with manual abstracts created in the
same way as the first 60 sets. The target lengths
of the summaries were shortened to eliminate the
400-word summary and to include a headline length
summary. The SEE GUI was modified to replace the
five-point intervals [All, most, some, hardly any, or
none] with percentages [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100] to
reflect their perception by judges and treatment by
researchers as a ratio scale. Seventeen groups that
took part in DUC-2002, with 13 of them tackling
the single document summary task (at 100 words)
and 8 of them working on the multi-document task.
3.1 DUC-2002 Results - Effect of Variability in
Judges
Beyond the main evaluation, it was decided to mea-
sure the variability of the coverage judgments, this
time holding the models constant. For six of the
document sets, each peer was judged three addi-
tional times, each time by a different judge but us-
ing the same model (not a model created by any
of the judges). Whereas the judgment effect does
not change the relative ranking of systems in the
TREC information retrieval task (Voorhees, 1998),
the task in coverage evaluation is much more cogni-
tively difficult and needed further exploration. In
DUC the question being asked involves finding a

shared meaning between the content in each model
summary unit and in the peer summary sentence,
and determining how much meaning is shared ? a
very subjective judgment.
3.2 Differences in the Coverage Judgments
Using the Same Model
The average absolute coverage score difference be-
tween the highest and lowest of the three extra scor-
ings of each peer summary for the 50-word sum-
maries was 0.079, which is a 47.6% difference
(0.070 for the 200-word, or 37.1%). This is about
the same percentage differences seen for the cover-
age differences based on using different models in
DUC-2001.
Once again, there is a wide variation across the
six document sets (see Figure 6). Even though the
median is similar across these sets, the variation
is much larger for two of the document sets, and
much smaller for two others. The variation in cover-
age score for the 200-word summaries is much less,
similar to what was found in DUC-2001.
3.3 Effects of Judgment Differences on per
System Coverage Scores
Figure 7 shows how the extra judgment variations
affected the average system coverage scores. The
lines plotted are similar to those shown for the
DUC-2001 model variations, one line for each set
of extra judgments. The scores again are very close
together in absolute value and in general the systems
are ranked similarly. In this case, the pairwise cor-
relations (Pearson?s) were 0.840, 0.723, and 0.801
(p < 0.05). With only six document sets involved in
the averaging, versus the 20 used in DUC-2001, it
is surprising that there is still so little effect.
3.4 ANOVA Results
The extra three judgments per peer allowed for anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) and estimates of the sizes
of the various main effects and interactions. While
the main effects (the judge, system, and document
set) can be large, they are by definition equally dis-
tributed across all systems. Although still signifi-
cant, the three interactions modeled ? judge/system,
judge/docset, and system/docset, are much smaller
(on the order of the noise, i.e., residuals) and so are
not likely to introduce a bias into the evaluation.
Due to lack of space, only the ANOVA for DUC-
2003 is included (see Table 1).
4 DUC-2003
For DUC-2003 it was decided to change the tasks
somewhat. In an effort to get the human sum-
maries closer to a common focus, each of the multi-
document summary tasks had some constraining
factor. There were four different tasks for sum-
marization, one very short ?headline? task for sin-
gle documents (300 single documents in the test
set), and three different multi-document summary
tasks (each task had 30 document sets used in test-
ing). There were 21 groups that participated in
DUC-2003, with 13 of them doing task 1, 16 do-
ing task 2, 11 doing task 3 and only 9 trying task
4.

4.1 DUC-2003 Results - Effect of Variability in
Judges and Models
Beyond the main evaluation it was decided to do
further investigation into the effects of model and
judgment variation, in particular to focus on task 4
(create short summaries of 10 documents that were
relevant to a given question). Each of the 30 doc-
ument sets in task 4 had four different model sum-
maries built by four different people, and four judg-
ments made where the judge in each case was the
model creator. The two types of variations were de-
liberately confounded for several reasons. The first
was that the variations had already been investigated
separately and it was important to investigate the
combined effect. The second related issue is that
this confounding mimics the way the evaluation is
being run, i.e. the judges are normally using their
own model, not someone else?s model. The third
reason was to provide input to the proposed auto-
matic evaluation (ROUGE) to be used in DUC-2004
in which multiple models would be used but with no
human judgments.
4.2 Differences in Model/Judgment Sets
The n-gram overlap for the 30 document sets is
shown in Figure 8 with six possible pairwise com-
parisons for each set of four model summaries. The
average unigram overlap is 0.200, but again a wide
variation in overlap across the different document
sets.

Figure 10: DUC-2003 median coverage by systems
using extra judgment sets (100-word summaries)
are still high, with an average absolute coverage dif-
ference of 0.139 or 69.1% difference. Again there
is a wide variation across document set/judge pair
(see Figure 9).
Figure 10 shows the absolute coverage scores for
each system for each of the four model/judgment
pairs. The difference in absolute scores is small,
and the relative ranking of the systems is mostly un-
changed. For DUC-2003, the pairwise correlations
(Pearson?s) are 0.899, 0.894, 0.837, 0.827, 0.794,
and 0.889 (p < 0.05). Additionally the scores are
lower and closer than in earlier DUCs; this is proba-

Table 1: Analysis of Variance for DUC-2003
bly because task 4 was a new task and systems were
in a learning curve.
4.4 ANOVA Results
An analysis of variance was also run on the DUC-
2003 task 4 multiple models and judgments study,
and results are presented in Table 1. The abbre-
viations for the column headings are as follows:
Df (degrees of freedom), SS (sum of squares), MS
(mean square), F (F value), Pr(F) (probability of F
under the null hypothesis). The judge, system, and
document set effects predominate as expected. Al-
though still significant, the three interactions mod-
eled - judge/system (jud/sys), judge/docset (jud/ds)
and system/docset (sys/ds) are smaller than any of
the main effects.
5 Conclusions
The secondary experiments described in this paper
were by necessity small in scope and so are not
conclusive. Still they consistently suggest stability
of the SEE-based coverage results reported in the
first three DUCs, i.e., despite large variations in the
human-generated model summaries and large vari-
ations in human judgments of single-model cover-
age, the ranking of the systems remained compara-
tively constant when averaged over dozens of docu-
ment sets, dozens of peer summaries, and 10 or so
judges.
Note that this is only on average, i.e. there will
be variations reflected in the individual document
sets and the scoring cannot be used reliably at that
level. However, variation in human summaries re-
flects the real application and one can only aim at
improved performance on average for better sum-
mary methodology.
Attempts to reduce or incorporate variability in
summarization evaluation will and should continue,
e.g., by use of ?factoids? (van Halteren and Teufel,
2003) or ?summarization content units? (Passon-
neau and Nenkova, 2004) as smaller units for gen-
erating model summaries. The use of constraining
factors such as in DUC-2003 is helpful, but only in
some cases since there are many types of summaries
that do not have natural constraints. Variability is-
sues will likely have to be dealt with for some time
and from a number of points of view.
In manual evaluations the results of this study
need to be confirmed using other data. In ROUGE-
like automatic evaluations that avoid variability in
judgments and exploit variation in models, the ques-
tion of how the number of models and their variabil-
ity affect the quality of the ROUGE scoring needs
study.
Beyond laboratory-style evaluations, system
builders need to attend to variability. The averages
hide variations that need to be analysed; systems
that do well on average still need failure and suc-
cess analysis on individual test cases in order to im-
prove. The variations in human performance still
need to be studied to understand better why these
variations are occurring and what this implies about
the acceptability of automatic text summarization
for real end-users. The effect of variability in train-
ing data on the machine learning algorithms used in
constructing many summarization systems must be
understood.
