Abstract
The use of pivot languages and word-
alignment techniques over bilingual cor-
pora has proved an effective approach for
extracting paraphrases of words and short
phrases. However, inherent ambiguities in
the pivot language(s) can lead to inade-
quate paraphrases. We propose a novel ap-
proach that is able to extract paraphrases
by pivoting through multiple languages
while discriminating word senses in the in-
put language, i.e., the language to be para-
phrased. Text in the input language is an-
notated with ?senses? in the form of for-
eign phrases obtained from bilingual par-
allel data and automatic word-alignment.
This approach shows 62% relative im-
provement over previous work in generat-
ing paraphrases that are judged both more
accurate and more fluent.
1 Introduction
Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing a
given meaning. Generating paraphrases that go
beyond morphological variants of the original text
is a challenging problem and has been shown to
be useful in many natural language applications.
These include i) expanding the set of reference
translations for Machine Translation (MT) eval-
uation (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010; Liu et al,
2010) and parameter optimisation (Madnani et al,
2007), where multiple reference translations are
important to accommodate for valid variations of
system translations; ii) addressing the problem of
out-of-vocabulary words or phrases in MT, either
by replacing these by paraphrases that are known
to the MT system (Mirkin et al, 2009) or by ex-
panding the phrase table with new translation al-
ternatives (Callison-Burch et al, 2006); and iii)
expanding queries for improved coverage in ques-
tion answering (Riezler et al, 2007).
Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) introduced
an approach to paraphrasing which has shown par-
ticularly promising results by pivoting through dif-
ferent languages for which bilingual parallel data
is available. The approach consists in aligning
phrases in the bilingual parallel corpus to find
pairs of phrases (e1, e2) in the input language, i.e.,
the language to be paraphrased, which typically
align to the same foreign phrases F = {f : e1 ?
f ? e2}. This intermediate language is called
pivot language and the phrases f ? F that support
the equivalence (e1, e2) are called pivot phrases.
If there exists a non-empty set of pivots connect-
ing e1 to e2, e2 is said to be a paraphrase of e1. The
paraphrase is scored in terms of the conditional
probabilities observed in the parallel corpus1 by
marginalising out the pivot phrases that support
the alignment (e1, e2) as shown in Equation 1.
p(e2|e1) =
?
f?F
p(f |e1)p(e2|f) (1)
Equation 1 allows paraphrases to be extracted
by using multiple pivot languages such that these
languages help discard inadequate paraphrases re-
sulting from ambiguous pivot phrases. However
in this formulation all senses of the input phrase
are mixed together in a single distribution. For ex-
ample, for the Spanish input phrase acabar con,
both paraphrases superar (overcome) and elim-
inar (eliminate) may be adequate depending on
the context, however they are not generally in-
terchangeable. In (Bannard and Callison-Burch,

relative counts in word-aligned parallel corpus.
202
2005), the distributions learnt from different bilin-
gual corpora are combined through a simple av-
erage. This makes the model naturally favour
the most frequent senses of the phrases, assigning
very low probabilities to less frequent senses. Sec-
tion 5 shows evidence of how this limitation makes
paraphrases with certain senses unreachable.
We propose a novel formulation of the problem
of generating paraphrases that is constrained by
sense information in the form of foreign phrases,
which can be thought of as a quasi-sense annota-
tion. Using a bilingual parallel corpus to annotate
phrases with their quasi-senses has proved help-
ful in building word-sense disambiguation (WSD)
models for MT (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et
al., 2007): instead of monolingual senses, pos-
sible translations of phrases obtained with word-
alignment were used as senses. Our approach per-
forms paraphrase extraction by pivoting through
multiple languages while penalising senses of the
input that are not supported by these pivots.
Our experiments show that the proposed ap-
proach can effectively eliminate inadequate para-
phrases for polysemous phrases, with a significant
improvement over previous approaches. We ob-
serve absolute gains of 15-25% in precision and
recall in generating paraphrases that are judged
fluent and meaning preserving in context.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2
describes additional previous work on paraphrase
extraction and pivoting. Section 3 presents the
proposed model. Section 4 introduces our experi-
mental settings, while Section 5 shows the results
of a series of experiments.
2 Related work
In addition to the well-known approach by (Ban-
nard and Callison-Burch, 2005), the following
previous approaches using pivot languages for
paraphrasing can be mentioned. For a recent
and comprehensive survey on a number of data-
driven paraphrase generation methods, we refer
the reader to (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).
Cohn and Lapata (2007) make use of multi-
ple parallel corpora to improve Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT) by triangulation for lan-
guages with little or no source-target parallel data
available. Translation tables are learnt by pivot-
ing through languages for which source-pivot and
pivot-target bilingual corpora can be found. Multi-
ple pivot languages were found useful to preserve
the meaning of the source in the triangulated trans-
lation, as different languages are likely to realise
ambiguities differently. Although their findings
apply to generating translation candidates, the in-
put phrases are not constrained to specific senses,
and as a consequence multiple translations, which
are valid in different contexts but not generally
interchangeable, are mixed together in the same
distribution. In SMT the target Language Model
(LM) helps selecting the adequate translation can-
didate in context.
Callison-Burch (2008) extends (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005) by adding syntactic con-
straints to the model. Paraphrase extraction is
done by pivoting using word-alignment informa-
tion, as before, but sentences are syntactically
annotated and paraphrases are restricted to those
with the same syntactic category. This addresses
categorial ambiguity by preventing that words
with a given category (e.g. a noun) are para-
phrased by words with other categories (e.g., a
verb). However, the approach does not solve the
more complex issue of polysemous paraphrases:
words with the same category but different mean-
ings, such as the noun bank as financial institution
and land alongside a river/lake.
Marton et al (2009) derive paraphrases from
monolingual data using distributional similarity
metrics. The approach has the advantage of not re-
quiring bilingual parallel data, but it suffers from
issues typical of distributional similarity metrics.
In particular, it produces paraphrases that share the
same or similar contexts but are related in ways
that do not always characterise paraphrasing, such
as antonymy.
3 Paraphrasing through multilingual
constraints
Our approach to paraphrasing can be applied to
both individual words or sequences of words of
any length, conditioned only on sufficient evi-
dence of these segments in a parallel corpus. We
use segments as provided by the standard phrase
extraction process from phrase-based SMT ap-
proaches (see Section 4), which in most cases
range from individual words to short sequences of
words (up to seven words in our case). Hereafter,
we refer to these segments simply as phrases.
A model for paraphrasing under a constrained
set of senses should take into account both the
input phrase and the sense tag while selecting

the pivot phrases that will lead to adequate para-
phrases. In our approach a sense tag consists in a
phrase in a foreign language, that is, a valid trans-
lation of the input phrase in a language of interest,
here referred to as target language. Treating the
target language vocabulary as a sense repository is
a good strategy from both theoretical and practi-
cal perspectives: it has been shown that monolin-
gual sense distinctions can be effectively captured
by translations into second languages, especially
as language family distance increases (Resnik and
Yarowsky, 1999; Specia et al, 2006). These trans-
lations can be easily captured given the avail-
ability of bilingual parallel data and robust au-
tomatic word-alignment techniques (Carpuat and
Wu, 2007; Chan et al, 2007).
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed model to pro-
duce sense tagged paraphrases. We start the pro-
cess at e1 and we need to make sure that the pivot
phrases f ? F align back to the input language,
producing the paraphrase e2, and to the target lan-
guage, producing the sense tag q. To avoid com-
puting the distribution p(e2, q|f) ? which would
require a trilingual parallel corpus ? we assume
that e2 and q are conditionally independent on f :
p(e2, q|f)
e2??q|f= p(e2|f)p(q|f)
In other words, we assume that pivot phrases gen-
erate paraphrases and sense tags independently.
Equation 2 shows how paraphrase probabilities are
computed by marginalising out the pivot phrases
under this assumption.

In order to constrain the extraction of para-
phrases such that it complies with a sense repos-
itory, in addition to bilingual parallel corpora be-
tween the input language and the pivot languages,
our model requires bilingual parallel corpora be-
tween the pivot languages and the language that is
used for sense annotation.
Callison-Burch (2007) discusses factors affect-
ing paraphrase quality, one of which is word
senses. Paraphrasing through pivoting essentially
relies on the hypothesis that different pivot phrases
can be used to identify synonymy, rather than pol-
ysemy (an assumption made in the WSD liter-
ature). Callison-Burch (2007) also proposes an
extraction procedure that may be conditioned on
specific contexts of the input phrase (Bannard
and Callison-Burch, 2005), where the context is
a given pivot phrase.2 However, that model is un-
able to pivot through multiple languages. As we
show in Section 5, this makes the model extremely
sensitive to ambiguities of the one phrase used as
both sense tag and pivot.
The model we propose attempts to perform
sense-disambiguated paraphrase extraction, that
is, paraphrases are discovered in the context of
translation candidates of the input phrases. In ad-
dition, it allows the use of multiple pivot languages
in the process, capitalising on both the WSD
and the paraphrase assumption. While the target
phrases discriminate different senses of the input
phrases, the pivot phrases coming from multiple
languages bring extra evidence to jointly capture
the ambiguities introduced by the target phrases
themselves.
To illustrate the impact of this contribution, con-
sider the polysemous Spanish word forma, and
some of its translations into English extracted
from our corpus (Section 4): kind, way, means
and form. The English words distinguish three
possible senses of forma: (a) means/way of do-
ing/achieving something, (b) shape, and (c) type
or group sharing common traits. The model pre-
sented in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005)
cannot discriminate these senses. It mixes valid
senses of forma and (correctly) proposes the para-
phrases manera and modo for sense (a), and tipo

for sense (c). However, paraphrases for sense (b)
are over penalised and account for very little of the
probability mass of the candidate paraphrases of
forma. Their extension which conditions extrac-
tion on a given pivot phrase is highly sensitive to
the ambiguities of the phrase used as sense anno-
tation. Table 5 shows how this model (CB-wsd in
the Table) makes mistakes for most senses of the
input due to the ambiguities of the English context
kind, way, means and form. Our approach (multi
in the Table) on the other hand successfully sep-
arates paraphrases according to the sense annota-
tion provided.
4 Experimental settings
4.1 Resources
The source of bilingual data used in the experi-
ments is the Europarl collection (Koehn, 2005).
We paraphrase Spanish (es) phrases using their
corresponding English (en) phrases as sense tags
and nine European languages as pivots: Ger-
man (de), Dutch (nl), Danish (da), Swedish (sv),
Finnish (fi), French (fr), Italian (it), Portuguese
(pt) and Greek (el). The tools provided along
with the corpus were used to extract the sentence
aligned parallel data as shown in Table 1.
The sentence aligned parallel data is first word-
aligned using GIZA++ in both source-target and
target-source directions, followed by the applica-
tion of traditional symmetrisation heuristics (Och
and Ney, 2003). These aligned corpora are used
for paraphrase extraction, except for a subset of
them used in the creation of a test set (Section 4.2).
4.2 Test set creation
Since we are interested in showing the ability
of our approach to find adequate paraphrases in
the presence of a foreign phrase (the sense tag),
it is important that our test set contains polyse-
mous phrases. Like in (Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005), we use the Spanish WordNet3 to
bias our selection of phrases to paraphrase to con-
tain ambiguous cases. However, rather than bi-
asing selection towards having more multi-word
expressions, we chose to have more polysemous
cases. From the Spanish WordNet, we selected 50
phrases (with at least one content word) to be para-
phrased such that 80% of the samples (40 phrases)
had at least 2 senses (with a given part-of-speech

ties). Figure 2 lists the selected words and phrases
in their base forms.
The bilingual corpus was queried for sentences
containing at least one of the 50 phrases listed in
Figure 2, or any of their morphological variants.
The resulting sentences were then grouped on the
basis of whether or not they shared the same En-
glish translation. To find the English phrase (i.e.,
our sense tag) which constrains the sense of the
Spanish phrase, we followed the heuristics used in
phrase-based SMT to extract the minimal phrase
pair that includes the Spanish phrase and is con-
sistent with the word-alignment4 (Koehn et al,
2003). We discarded groups containing fewer than
five sentence pairs and randomly sampled 2-6 con-
texts per Spanish phrase. The resulting test set is
made of 258 Spanish phrases in context such as
the one exemplified in Figure 3.
4.3 Paraphrasing
Nine pivot languages were used to constrain para-
phrase extraction following the approach pre-
sented in Section 3. The conditional probabil-
ity distributions over phrase pairs in Equation 2
are estimated using relative frequencies. For each
Spanish phrase in the test set, we retrieve their

paraphrase candidates grouped by sense (English
translation) and rank them based on the evidence
collected from all bilingual corpora. Evidence
from different pivot languages is combined using
their average. English itself was not used as a pivot
language. It was used only to provide sense tags.
The rationale behind this choice is that if the lan-
guage used to provide sense tags is also used as
pivot language, there is no obvious way of esti-
mating p(q|f) in Equation 2. Note that in this case
this probability would represent the likelihood of
the English phrase aligning to itself.
Similar to (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005),
we weight our paraphrase probabilities using an
LM to adjust it to the context of the input sentence.
We use a 5-gram LM trained on the Spanish part of
Europarl with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
Paraphrases are re-ranked in context by multiply-
ing the paraphrase probability and the LM score of
the sentence.5
In order to assess the performance of our model,
we compare it to two variants of the models pro-
posed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).
multi: the paraphrasing model with multilingual
constraints introduced in this paper.
CCB: the model in (Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005) which does not explicitly per-
form any sense disambiguation.
CCB-wsd: an extended model in (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005) using English phrases
as sense tags for pivoting.
Using each of these three models, we para-
phrased the 258 samples in our test set, retrieving
the 3-best paraphrases in context for each model.
CCB is used with 10 pivot languages (English is
included as a pivot) to generate paraphrase candi-
dates. Note that CCB relies solely on the LM com-
ponent to fit the paraphrase candidate to the con-
text. On the other hand, CCB-wsd and multi both
have access to sense annotation, but while multi
is able to benefit from multiple pivot languages,
CCB-wsd can only pivot through the one English
phrase provided as sense annotation.
5Given the localised effect of the phrase replacement
within a given context in terms of n-gram language mod-
elling, a neighbourhood of n-1 words on each side of the
selected phrase is sufficient to re-rank paraphrase candidates:
p(w?4 . . . w?1e2w+1 . . . w+4) for our 5-gram LM.
4.4 Evaluation
To assess whether the proposed model effectively
disambiguates senses of candidate paraphrases,
we perform experiments using similar settings
to those in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).
Paraphrases are evaluated in context (a sentence)
using binary human judgements in terms of the
following components:
Meaning (M): whether or not the candidate con-
veys the meaning of the original phrase; and
Grammar (G): whether or not the candidate pre-
serves the fluency of the sentence.
These two components are assessed separately and
a paraphrase candidate is considered to be cor-
rect only when it is judged to be both meaning
preserving and grammatical. Our evaluators were
presented with one pair of sentences at a time, the
original one and its paraphrased version. For ev-
ery test sample we selected the 3-best paraphrases
of each method and distributed them amongst the
evaluators. We considered two evaluation scenar-
ios:
Gold-standard translations: the English trans-
lation as found in Europarl was taken as
sense tag, using automatic word-alignments
to identify the English phrase that constrains
the sense of the Spanish phrase.
SMT translations: a phrase-based SMT system
built using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al,
2007) and the whole Spanish-English dataset
(except the sentences in the test set) was
used to translated the Spanish sentences. In-
stead of gold-standard translations as a quasi-
perfect sense annotation (quasi because the
word-alignment is still automatic and thus
prone to errors), the phrase-based SMT sys-
tem plays the role of a sense annotation mod-
ule predicting the ?sense? tags.
Note that models may not be able to produce
a paraphrase for certain input phrases, e.g. when
the input phrase is not found in the bilingual cor-
pora. Therefore, we assess precision (P) and re-
call (R) as the number of paraphrases in context
that are judged correct out of the number of cases
for which a candidate paraphrase was proposed,
and out of the total number of test samples, re-
spectively. To summarise the results, accuracy is
expressed in terms of F1.

In the following section we present results on
whether the best candidate (Top-1) or at least one
of the two (Top-2) or three (Top-3) best candidates
satisfies the criterion under consideration (mean-
ing/grammar).
5 Results
The evaluation was performed by seven native
speakers of Spanish who judged a total of 5, 110
sentences containing one paraphrased input phrase
each. We used 40 overlapping judgements across
annotators to measure inter-annotator agreement.
The average inter-annotator agreement in terms
of Cohen?s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) is 0.54 ? 0.15
for meaning judgements, 0.63 ? 0.16 for gram-
mar judgements and 0.62 ? 0.20 for correctness
judgements. These figures are similar or superior
to those reported in (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005; Callison-Burch, 2008), which we consider
particularly encouraging as in our case we have
seven instead of only two annotators. In Tables
2, 3 and 4 we report the performance of the three
models in terms of precision, recall and F1, with
p-values < 0.01 based on the t-test for statistical
significance.
5.1 Paraphrasing from human translations
We first assess the paraphrasing models us-
ing gold-standard translations, that is, the En-
glish phrases were selected via automatic word-
alignments between the input text and its corre-
sponding human translation from Europarl. Ta-
ble 2 shows the performance in terms of F1 for
our three criteria: meaning preservation, grammat-
icality, and correctness. Our method (multi) out-
performs the best performing alternative (CCB-
wsd) by a large margin. It is 19% more effective
at selecting the 1-best candidate in terms of cor-

rectness. A consistent gain is also observed when
more guesses are allowed (top 2?3), showing that
our model is better at ranking the top candidates
as well. CCB-wsd and multi are close in terms of
paraphrases that are meaning preserving, however
their differences become more obvious as more
guesses are allowed, again showing that multi is
better at ranking more adequate paraphrases first.
Moreover, multi consistently chooses more gram-
matical paraphrases.
Table 2 also shows that our model consistently
improves both the precision and recall of the pre-
dictions. Recall improves by 14% w.r.t. CCB-wsd
because multi is able to find more paraphrases,
which we believe are only reachable through the
additional pivots. For example, in our data the
paraphrase forma ? medio in the sense of way
(see Table 5) is only found through the Dutch
pivot middel, which is not accessible to CCB-
wsd. Recall is much lower in CCB because of
the model?s strong bias towards the most frequent
senses: other senses receive very little of the prob-
ability mass and thus rarely feature amongst the
top ranked paraphrases. Our multilingual disam-
biguation model also shows a 25% increase in pre-
cision, which must be due to the stronger contri-
bution of the sense discrimination over the LM
component in getting the senses of the paraphrases
right.
To show the impact of the LM re-ranking com-
ponent, in Table 3 we remove this component from
all models, such that the ranking of paraphrases is
done purely based on the paraphrase probabilities.
All models are harmed by the absence of the LM
component, but to different extents and for differ-
ent reasons. CCB typically ranks at the top para-
phrases that convey the most frequent sense and
the LM is the only component with information
about the input context. CCB-wsd is impacted the
most: typically invalid paraphrases are produced
from unrelated senses of the foreign phrase used
as sense tag, they do not represent any valid sense
of the input but still get ranked at the top. For
207
this model, the LM component is crucial to prune
such unrelated paraphrases. Back to Table 2, the
superior performance of CCB-wsd over CCB in
the presence of the LM component suggest that
CCB-wsd assigns less negligible probabilities to
the paraphrases that convey a valid sense of the
input. Finally, multi?s performance is only truly
harmed in terms of grammaticality: sense discrim-
ination is the main responsible for selecting the
appropriate sense, while the LM component is re-
sponsible for selecting the candidate that makes
the sentence more fluent. Further investigation
showed that in some cases the most meaning pre-
serving option was down-weighted due to low flu-
ency, and a less adequate option was chosen, ex-
plaining the slight improvement under the mean-
ing preservation criterion when no LM re-ranking
is performed.
Table 5 lists the 5-best paraphrases of the Span-
ish phrase forma in its different senses. The para-
phrases are ranked by CCB-wsd and multi out of
context, that is, without LM re-ranking. Note that,
because the sense tags are themselves ambiguous
in English, most of the top-ranked paraphrases
from CCB-wsd are inadequate, that is, they do not
convey any valid sense of forma.
It is also interesting to observe the impact of the
different pivot languages on the performance of
our proposed approach. Figure 4 shows CCB-wsd
and multi, both using LM re-ranking. For multi
we can see the impact of the pivot languages indi-
vidually and in groups.6 Except for Finnish when
used on its own as pivot all other setups are supe-
rior to CCB-wsd. We can also see that putting to-
gether languages of different families has a strong
positive impact, probably due to the fact that am-
biguities are realised differently in languages that
are farther from each other, emphasising the po-
tential of sense discrimination by pivoting through
multiple languages.
5.2 Paraphrasing from machine translations
Finally, we assessed the paraphrasing models us-
ing machine translations instead of gold-standard
translations from Europarl. In order to have an
idea of the quality of the SMT model beforehand,
we evaluated the machine translations in terms of
BLEU scores (Papineni et al, 2002) using a single
reference from Europarl. Our phrase-based SMT

model achieved 48.9 BLEU, which can be con-
sidered a high score for Europarl data (in-domain
evaluation). Table 4 is analogous to Table 2, but
with paraphrases extracted from machine trans-
lated sentences as opposed to human translations.
We observe that multi still outperforms CCB-
wsd by a large margin. On the one hand there is a
drop in precision of about 9% for correctness with
multi. On the other hand there is an improvement
in recall: multi improves from 3% (top-1 guess)
to 12% (top-3 guesses). Manual inspection re-
vealed that the tags predicted by the SMT model
are more frequent translation options, reducing the
chance of finding rare target phrases as sense an-
notation, for which significant statistics cannot be
computed. However, with respect to correctness,
the differences between this setting and that with
gold-standard translations are not statistically sig-
nificant.

5.3 Potential applications
In what follows we discuss two applications which
we believe could directly benefit from the para-
phrase extraction approach proposed in this paper.
MT evaluation metrics such as METEOR
(Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) and TESLA (Liu
et al, 2010) already use paraphrases of n-grams
in the machine translated sentence in an attempt
to match more of the reference translation?s n-
grams. TESLA, in particular, uses paraphrases
constrained by a single pivot language as sense tag
as originally proposed in (Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005). Metrics like METEOR, which use
paraphrases simply as a repository with extra op-
tions for the n-gram matching, could be extended
to use the word-alignment between the source sen-
tence and the translation to constrain the translated
phrases while paraphrasing them with multilingual
constraints. In this case the model would attempt
to paraphrase the MT, which is not necessarily
fluent, therefore potentially compromising its LM
component. However, even after completely disre-
garding the LM re-ranking (see context-insensitive
model multi in Table 3), we may be able to im-
prove n-gram matching by paraphrasing.
Handling out-of-vocabulary words in SMT by
expanding the bilingual phrase-tables (Callison-
Burch et al, 2006) is a direct application of the
sense constrained paraphrases. We can add trans-
lations for a given unknown phrase f1, whose
paraphrase f2 is present in the phrase-table and
is aligned to the target phrase e (sense tag). We
basically expand the phrase table to translate the
out-of-vocabulary word f1 using the knowledge
associated to its paraphrase f2 in the context of the
known translation e: (f2, e) ? (f1, e). The mul-
tilingual constraints offer more control over ambi-
guities, therefore potentially leading to more accu-
rate phrase pairs added to the phrase-table.
6 Conclusions and future work
We have proposed a new formulation of the prob-
lem of generating ?sense? tagged paraphrases for
words and short phrases using bilingual corpora
and multiple pivot languages to jointly disam-
biguate the input phrase and the sense tag. Sense
tags are phrases in a foreign language of interest,
for instance the target language of a phrase-based
SMT system.
The approach was evaluated against the state of
the art method for paraphrase extraction. Signif-
icant improvements were found in particular with
respect to two aspects: i) the proposed model has
higher recall, since it has access to paraphrases
that would receive a negligible probability mass
and therefore would never be selected in previ-
ous formulations, and ii) the proposed model has
higher precision, since it is able to filter out or rank
down paraphrases with incorrect senses.
In future work we plan to further evaluate the
approach in the two scenarios discussed in Sec-
tion 5.3: i) to expand the phrase table of SMT sys-
tems to address issues such as out-of-vocabulary
words and phrases; and ii) to evaluate and opti-
mise parameters of SMT systems using metrics
that can accommodate sense disambiguated para-
phrases. We also plan to integrate syntactic con-
straints, as proposed in (Callison-Burch, 2008), to
our model to investigate the complementarities be-
tween these two ways of constraining paraphras-
ing.
