Abstract
Uncertainty text detection is important
to many social-media-based applications
since more and more users utilize social
media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook,
etc.) as information source to produce
or derive interpretations based on them.
However, existing uncertainty cues are in-
effective in social media context because
of its specific characteristics. In this pa-
per, we propose a variant of annotation
scheme for uncertainty identification and
construct the first uncertainty corpus based
on tweets. We then conduct experiments
on the generated tweets corpus to study the
effectiveness of different types of features
for uncertainty text identification.
1 Introduction
Social media is not only a social network tool for
people to communicate but also plays an important
role as information source with more and more
users searching and browsing news on it. People
also utilize information from social media for de-
veloping various applications, such as earthquake
warning systems (Sakaki et al, 2010) and fresh
webpage discovery (Dong et al, 2010). How-
ever, due to its casual and word-of-mouth pecu-
liarities, the quality of information in social me-
dia in terms of factuality becomes a premier con-
cern. Chances are there for uncertain information
or even rumors flooding in such a context of free
form. We analyzed a tweet dataset which includes
326,747 posts (Details are given in Section 3) col-
lected during 2011 London Riots, and result re-
veals that at least 18.91% of these tweets bear un-
certainty characteristics1. Therefore, distinguish-
ing uncertain statements from factual ones is cru-
cial for users to synthesize social media informa-
tion to produce or derive reliable interpretations,
1The preliminary study was done based on a manually de-
fined uncertainty cue-phrase list. Tweets containing at least
one hedge cue were treated as uncertain.
and this is expected helpful for applications like
credibility analysis (Castillo et al, 2011) and ru-
mor detection (Qazvinian et al, 2011) based on
social media.
Although uncertainty has been studied theoret-
ically for a long time as a grammatical phenom-
ena (Seifert and Welte, 1987), the computational
treatment of uncertainty is a newly emerging area
of research. Szarvas et al (2012) pointed out that
?Uncertainty - in its most general sense - can be
interpreted as lack of information: the receiver of
the information (i.e., the hearer or the reader) can-
not be certain about some pieces of information?.
In recent years, the identification of uncertainty
in formal text, e.g., biomedical text, reviews or
newswire, has attracted lots of attention (Kilicoglu
and Bergler, 2008; Medlock and Briscoe, 2007;
Szarvas, 2008; Light et al, 2004). However, un-
certainty identification in social media context is
rarely explored.
Previous research shows that uncertainty identi-
fication is domain dependent as the usage of hedge
cues varies widely in different domains (Morante
and Sporleder, 2012). Therefore, the employment
of existing out-of-domain corpus to social media
context is ineffective. Furthermore, compared to
the existing uncertainty corpus, the expression of
uncertainty in social media is fairly different from
that in formal text in a sense that people usu-
ally raise questions or refer to external informa-
tion when making uncertain statements. But, nei-
ther of the uncertainty expressions can be repre-
sented based on the existing types of uncertainty
defined in the literature. Therefore, a different un-
certainty classification scheme is needed in social
media context.
In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty
classification scheme and construct the first uncer-
tainty corpus based on social media data ? tweets
in specific here. And then we conduct experi-
ments for uncertainty post identification and study
the effectiveness of different categories of features
based on the generated corpus.58
2 Related work
We introduce some popular uncertainty corpora
and methods for uncertainty identification.
2.1 Uncertainty corpus
Several text corpora from various domains have
been annotated over the past few years at different
levels (e.g., expression, event, relation, sentence)
with information related to uncertainty.
Sauri and Pustejovsky (2009) presented a cor-
pus annotated with information about the factu-
ality of events, namely Factbank, which is con-
structed based on TimeBank2 containing 3,123 an-
notated sentences from 208 news documents with
8 different levels of uncertainty defined.
Vincze et al (2008) constructed the BioSocpe
corpus, which consists of medical and biological
texts annotated for negation, uncertainty and their
linguistic scope. This corpus contains 20,924 sen-
tences.
Ganter et al (2009) generated Wikipedia
Weasels Corpus, where Weasel tags in Wikipedia
articles is adopted readily as labels for uncertainty
annotation. It contains 168,923 unique sentences
with 437 weasel tags in total.
Although several uncertainty corpora exist,
there is not a uniform set of standard for uncer-
tainty annotation. Szarvas et al (2012) normal-
ized the annotation of the three corpora aforemen-
tioned. However, the context of these corpora
is different from that of social media. Typically,
these documents annotated are grammatically cor-
rect, carefully punctuated, formally structured and
logically expressed.
2.2 Uncertainty identification
Previous work on uncertainty identification fo-
cused on classifying sentences into uncertain
or definite categories. Existing approaches are
mainly based on supervised methods (Light et
al., 2004; Medlock and Briscoe, 2007; Medlock,
2008; Szarvas, 2008) using the annotated corpus
with different types of features including Part-Of-
Speech (POS) tags, stems, n-grams, etc..
Classification of uncertain sentences was con-
solidated as a task in the 2010 edition of CoNLL
shared task on learning to detect hedge cues
and their scope in natural language text (Farkas
et al, 2010). The best system for Wikipedia
data (Georgescul, 2010) employed Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and the best system for biolog-
ical data (Tang et al, 2010) adopted Conditional
2http://www.timeml.org/site/timebank/
timebank.html
Random Fields (CRF).
In our work, we conduct an empirical study of
uncertainty identification on tweets dataset and ex-
plore the effectiveness of different types of fea-
tures (i.e., content-based, user-based and Twitter-
specific) from social media context.
3 Uncertainty corpus for microblogs
3.1 Types of uncertainty in microblogs
Traditionally, uncertainty can be divided into
two categories, namely Epistemic and Hypothet-
ical (Kiefer, 2005). For Epistemic, there are two
sub-classes Possible and Probable. For Hypotheti-
cal, there are four sub-classes including Investiga-
tion, Condition, Doxastic andDynamic. The detail
of the classification is described as below (Kiefer,
2005):
Epistemic: On the basis of our world knowledge
we cannot decide at the moment whether the
statement is true or false.
Hypothetical: This type of uncertainty includes
four sub-classes:
? Doxastic: Expresses the speaker?s be-
liefs and hypotheses.
? Investigation: Proposition under inves-
tigation.
? Condition: Proposition under condi-
tion.
? Dynamic: Contains deontic, disposi-
tional, circumstantial and buletic modal-
ity.
Compared to the existing uncertainty corpora,
social media authors enjoy free form of writing.
In order to study the difference, we annotated a
small set of 827 randomly sampled tweets accord-
ing to the scheme of uncertainty types above, in
which we found 65 uncertain tweets. And then,
we manually identified all the possible uncertain
tweets, and found 246 really uncertain ones out of
these 827 tweets, which means that 181 uncertain
tweets are missing based on this scheme. We have
the following three salient observations:
? Firstly, there is no tweet found with the type of
Investigation. We find people seldom use words
like ?examine? or ?test? (indicative words of In-
vestigation category) when posting tweets. Once
they do this, the statement should be considered
as highly certain. For example, @dobibid I have
tested the link, it is fake!
? Secondly, people frequently raise questions
about some specific topics for confirmation which
expresses uncertainty. For example, @ITVCentral59
Can you confirm that Birmingham children?s hos-
pital has/hasn?t been attacked by rioters?
? Thirdly, people tend to post message with exter-
nal information (e.g., story from friends) which re-
veals uncertainty. For example, Friend who works
at the children?s hospital in Birmingham says the
riot police are protecting it.
Based on these observations, we propose a vari-
ant of uncertainty types in social media context
by eliminating the category of Investigation and
adding the category of Question and External un-
der Hypothetical, as shown in Table 3.1. Note
that our proposed scheme is based on Kiefer?s
work (2005) which was previously extended to
normalize uncertainty corpora in different genres
by Szarvas et al (2012). But we did not try these
extended schema for specific genres since even the
most general one (Kiefer, 2005) was proved un-
suitable for social media context.
3.2 Annotation result
The dataset we annotated was collected from Twit-
ter using Streaming API during summer riots
in London during August 6-13 2011, including
326,747 tweets in total. Search criteria include
hashtags like #ukriots, #londonriots, #prayforlon-
don, and so on. We further extracted the tweets
relating to seven significant events during the riot
identified by UK newspaper The Guardian from
this set of tweets. We annotated all the 4,743 ex-
tracted tweets for the seven events3.
Two annotators were trained to annotate the
dataset independently. Given a collection of
tweets T = {t1, t2, t3...tn}, the annotation task is
to label each tweet ti as either uncertain or cer-
tain. Uncertainty assertions are to be identified
in terms of the judgements about the author?s in-
tended meaning rather than the presence of uncer-
tain cue-phrase. For those tweets annotated as un-
certain, sub-class labels are also required accord-
ing to the classification indicated in Table 3.1 (i.e.,
multi-label is allowed).
The Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) indi-
cating inter-annotator agreement was 0.9073 for
the certain/uncertain binary classification and was
0.8271 for fine-grained annotation. The conflict
labels from the two annotators were resolved by a
third annotator. Annotation result is displayed in
Table 3.2, where 926 out of 4,743 tweets are la-
beled as uncertain accounting for 19.52%. Ques-
tion is the uncertainty category with most tweets,
followed by External. Only 21 tweets are labeled

as Dynamic and all of them are buletic modal-
ity4 which shares similarity with Doxastic. There-
fore, we consider Dynamic together with Domes-
tic in the error analysis for simplicity. During
the preliminary annotation, we found that uncer-
tainty cue-phrase is a good indicator for uncer-
tainty tweets since tweets labeled as uncertain al-
ways contain at least one cue-phrase. Therefore,
annotators are also required identify cue-phrases
which trigger the sense of uncertainty in the tweet.
All cue-phrases appearing more than twice are col-
lected to form a uncertainty cue-phrase list.
4 Experiment and evaluation
We aim to identify those uncertainty tweets from
tweet collection automatically based on machine
learning approaches. In addition to n-gram fea-
tures, we also explore the effectiveness of three
categories of social media specific features includ-
ing content-based, user-based and Twitter-specific
ones. The description of the three categories of
features is shown in Table 4. Since the length of
tweet is relatively short, we therefore did not carry
out stopwords removal or stemming.
Our preliminary experiments showed that com-
bining unigrams with bigrams and trigrams gave
better performance than using any one or two of
these three features. Therefore, we just report the
result based on the combination of them as n-gram
features. Five-fold cross validation is used for
evaluation. Precision, recall and F-1 score of un-
certainty category are used as the metrics.
4.1 Overall performance
The overall performance of different approaches
is shown in Table 4.1. We used uncertainty cue-
phrase matching approach as baseline, denoted
by CP. For CP, we labeled tweets containing at
least one entry in uncertainty cue-phrase list (de-
scribed in Section 3) as uncertain. All the other
approaches are supervised methods using SVM
based on different feature sets. n-gram stands for
n-gram feature set, C means content-based feature
set, U denotes user-based feature set, T represents
4Proposition expresses plans, intentions or desires.60
Category Subtype Cue Phrase Example
Epistemic Possible, etc. may, etc. It may be raining.Probable likely, etc. It is probably raining.
Hypothetical
Condition if, etc. If it rains, we?ll stay in.
Doxastic believe, etc. He believes that the Earth is flat.
Dynamic hope, etc. fake picture of the london eye on fire... i hope
External someone said, etc. Someone said that London zoo was attacked.
Question seriously?, etc. Birmingham riots are moving to the children hospital?! seriously?

Table 4: Result of uncertainty tweets identification
Twitter-specific feature set and ALL is the combi-
nation of C, U and T.
Table 4.1 shows that CP achieves the best recall
but its precision is the lowest. The learning based
methods with different feature sets give some sim-
ilar recalls. Compared to CP, SVMn?gram in-
creases the F-1 score by 43.9% due to the salient
improvement on precision and small drop of re-
call. The performance improves in terms of pre-
cision and F-1 score when the feature set is ex-
panded by adding C, U or T onto n-gram, where
+C brings the highest gain, and SVMn?gram+ALL
performs best in terms of precision and F-1 score.
We then study the effectiveness of the three
content-based features, and result shows that the
presence of uncertain cue-phrase is most indica-
tive for uncertainty tweet identification.
4.2 Error analysis
We analyze the prediction errors based on
SVMn?gram+ALL. The distribution of errors in
terms of different types of uncertainty is shown
Type Poss. Prob. D.&D. Cond. Que. Ext.
Total# 16 129 69 71 488 208
Error# 11 20 18 11 84 40
% 0.69 0.16 0.26 0.15 0.17 0.23
Table 5: Error distributions
in Table 4.2. Our method performs worst on the
type of Possible and on the combination of Dy-
namic and Doxastic because these two types have
the least number of samples in the corpus and the
classifier tends to be undertrained without enough
samples.
5 Conclusion and future work
In this paper, we propose a variant of classification
scheme for uncertainty identification in social me-
dia and construct the first uncertainty corpus based
on tweets. We perform uncertainty identification
experiments on the generated dataset to explore
the effectiveness of different types of features. Re-
sult shows that the three categories of social media
specific features can improve uncertainty identifi-
cation. Furthermore, content-based features bring
the highest improvement among the three and the
presence of uncertain cue-phrase contributes most
for content-based features.
In future, we will explore to use uncertainty
identification for social media applications.
