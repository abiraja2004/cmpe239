Abstract
Theories of discourse structure hypothesize a
hierarchical structure of discourse segments,
typically tree-structured. While substantial
work has been done on identifying and auto-
matically recognizing the textual and prosodic
correlates of discourse structure in mono-
logue, comparable cues for dialogue or multi-
party conversation, and in particular human-
computer dialogue remain relatively less stud-
ied. In this paper, we explore prosodic
cues to discourse segmentation in human-
computer dialogue. Using data drawn from
60 hours of interactions with a voice-only
conversational spoken language system, we
identify pitch and intensity features that sig-
nal segment boundaries. Specifically, based
on 473 pairs of segment-final and segment-
initiating utterances, we find significant in-
creases for segment-initial utterances in max-
imum pitch, average pitch, and average inten-
sity, while segment-final utterances show sig-
nificantly lower minimum pitch. These results
suggest that even in the artificial environment
of human-computer dialogue, prosodic cues ro-
bustly signal discourse segment structure, com-
parably to the contrastive uses of pitch and am-
plitude identified in natural monologues.

1 Introduction
Contemporary theories of discourse, both computational
and descriptive, postulate a tree-structured hierarchical
model of discourse. These structures may be viewed as
corresponding to?intentional? structure of discourse seg-
ment purposes in the view of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986),
to plan and subplan structure directly in the view of
(Allen and Litman, 1990) , to nuclei and satellite rhetori-
cal relations in the Rhetorical Structure Theory of (Mann
and Thompson, 1987), or to information structures as in
(Traum and Hinkelman, 1992). Despite this diversity of
views on the sources of structural organization, these the-
ories agree on the decomposition of discourse into seg-
ments and subsegments in a hierarchical structure.
Discourse segments help to establish the domain of in-
terpretation for referents or anaphors. (Grosz, 1977) Dis-
course segmentation can also provide guidance for sum-
marization or retrieval by identifying the topical structure
of extended text spans. As a result, an understanding of
the mechanisms that signal discourse structure is highly
desirable.
While substantial work has been done on identifying
and automatically recognizing the textual and prosodic
correlates of discourse structure in monologue, compa-
rable cues for dialogue or multi-party conversation, and
in particular human-computer dialogue remain relatively
less studied. In this paper, we explore prosodic cues to
discourse segmentation in human-computer dialogue.
Using data from 60 hours of interactions with a voice-
only conversational spoken language system, we identify
pitch and intensity features that signal segment bound-
aries. Specifically, based on 473 pairs of segment-final
and segment-initiating utterances, we find significant in-
creases for segment-initial utterances in maximum and
average pitch and average intensity, with significantly
lower minimum pitch for segment-final utterances. These
results suggest that even in the artificial environment of
human-computer dialogue, prosodic cues robustly sig-
nal discourse segment structure, comparably to the con-
trastive uses of pitch and amplitude identified in natural
monologues.
1.1 Overview
We begin with a discussion of related work on discourse
segmentation and dialogue act identification in mono-
logue and dialogue, primarily in the human-human case.
Then we introduce the system and data collection pro-
cess that produced the human-computer discourse seg-
ment change materials for the current analysis. We de-
scribe the acoustic analyses performed and the features
chosen for comparison. Then we identify the prosodic
cues that distinguish discourse segment boundaries and
discuss the relation to previously identified cues for other
discourse types. Finally we conclude and present some
future work.
2 Related Work
Cues for and automatic segmentation of discourse struc-
ture have been most extensively studied for written and
spoken monologue. For written narrative, discourse seg-
ment boundaries have been identified based on textual
topic similarity with a variety of approaches based on
Hearst?s Textiling(Hearst, 1994). More complex rheto-
rial structure theory trees have also been extracted based
heavily on cue phrases and discourse markers by (Marcu,
2000).
In spoken monologue, prosodic cues to discourse
structure and segmentation have been explored by
(Nakatani et al, 1995; Swerts, 1997). Increases in pitch
range, amplitude, and silence duration appear to signal
discourse segment boundaries across different domains
- voicemail, broadcast news, descriptive narrative - and
across different languages, such as English and Dutch.
Comparable prosodic cues have been applied to the re-
lated task of news story segmentation, in conjunction
with textual cues to topicality, by (Tur et al, 2001), where
large pitch differences between pre- and post- boundary
positions play the most significant role among prosodic
cues.
In spoken dialogue, research has focused on the identi-
fication of dialogue acts and dialogue games. Integration
of textual and prosodic cues, such as particular pitch ac-
cent or contour types, have been found useful for identi-
fying act type(Shriberg et al, 1998; Taylor et al, 1998).
Specific classes of dialogue act, such as corrections (re-
quest repair), have received particular interest in work
by (Levow, 1998; Swerts et al, 2000) in the context of
human-computer error resolution. Recent work on the
ICSI multi-party meeting recorder data has demonstrated
some very preliminary results on multi-party segmenta-
tion (Galley et al, 2003); prosodic information in this
case was limited to silence duration.
With the exception of work on error resolution, most
work on dialogue has focused human-human interaction
and on identification of particular act or game types. Here
we concentrate on the general question of discourse seg-
mentation in voice-only human-computer interaction. We
ask whether the cues to segment structure identified for
monologue are robust to the change in number and type
of conversational participant.
3 Data Collection
3.1 Speech System Description
The utterances used in the analysis of discourse seg-
mentation for human-computer interaction were drawn
from approximately 60 hours of user interactions in a
field trial of the Sun Microsystems SpeechActs system
(Yankelovich et al, 1995). SpeechActs provides a voice-
only interface to common desktop applications such as
e-mail, calendar, weather reports, stock quotes, and time
and currency conversions. The system allows conversa-
tional interactions with speech recognition provided by
BBN?s HARK recognizer and speech synthesis through
Centigram?s TruVoice system. A sample interaction ap-
pears below. 1
SpeechActs: You have 14 new messages and
47 old messages. The first new
message is from Eric Baatz
regarding ?report completed.?
User: Let me hear it.
SpeechActs: ?The first draft is ready for
your comments. Eric.?
User: Reply and include current message.
SpeechActs: Preparing message to Eric Baatz.
Begin recording after the tone.
When finished, pause several seconds.
User: Eric, I?ll get those to you
this afternoon.
SpeechActs: Say cancel, send, or review.
User: Send.
SpeechActs: Message sent. What now?
User: Next message.
SpeechActs: New message two from Stuart
Adams, subject ?Can we meet at
3:00 today??
User: Switch to calendar...
The field trial involved a group of nineteen subjects.
Four of the participants were members of the system de-
velopment staff, fourteen were volunteers drawn from
Sun Microsystems? staff, and a final class of subjects con-
sisted of one-time guest users. There were three female
and fifteen male regular user subjects.
All interactions with the system were recorded and dig-
itized in standard telephone audio quality format at 8kHz
sampling in 8-bit mu-law encoding during the conversa-
tion. In addition, speech recognition results, parser re-
sults, and synthesized responses were logged. A paid as-
sistant then produced a correct verbatim transcript of all
user utterances. Overall there were 7752 user utterances
recorded.

3.2 Data Coding and Extraction
Consistent discourse segmentation can be difficult even
for trained experts (Nakatani et al, 1995; Swerts, 1997;
Passoneau and Litman, 1997), and differences in depth
of nesting for discourse structure appear to be the most
problematic. As a result, we chose to examine utterances
whose segment and topic initiating status would be rela-
tively unambiguous. As the SpeechActs system consists
of 6 different applications, we chose to focus on changes
from application to application as reliable indicators of
topic initiation. These commands are either simply the
name of the desirable application, as in ?Mail? or ?Cal-
endar?, possibly with an optional politeness term, or a
switch command, such as ?Switch to? and the name of
the application. Approximately 1400 such utterances oc-
cured during the field trial data collection.
We performed an automatic forced alignment in order
to identify and extract the relevant utterances from the
digitized audio. Using the full sequence of synthesized
computer utterances and manually transcribed user utter-
ances, we applied the align function of the Sonic speech
recognizer provided as part of the University of Colorado
(CU) Communicator system to a 16-bit linear version of
the original audio recording. 473 utterances that were
correctly aligned by this automatic process were used for
the current analysis.
4 Acoustic Feature Extraction
Based on prior results for monologue, we selected pitch
and amplitude features for consideration. Although si-
lence duration is often a good cue to discourse segment
boundary position in narrative, we excluded it from con-
sideration in the current study due to the awkward pace of
the SpeechActs human-computer interactions. Users had
to wait for a tone to speak, and interturn silences were as
long as six seconds.
We used the ?To Pitch...? and ?To intensity? functions
in Praat(Boersma, 2001), a freely available acoustic-
phonetic analysis package, to automatically extract the
pitch (in Hertz) and amplitude (in decibels) for the in-
teraction. To smooth out local jitter and noise in the
pitch and amplitude contours, we applied a 5-point me-
dian filter. Finally, in order to provide overall compara-
bility across male and female subjects and across differ-
ent channel characteristics for different sessions2, we per-
formed per-speaker, per-session normalization of pitch
and amplitude values, computed as

. The re-
sulting pitch and amplitude values within the time re-
gions identified for each utterance by forced alignment
2Since the interface was accessed over a regular analog tele-
phone line from a wide variety of locations - including noisy
international airports, the recording quality and level varied
widely.

were used for subsequent analysis.
5 Prosodic Analysis
For both pitch and amplitude we computed summary
scalar measures for each utterance. Mean pitch and inten-
sity are intended to capture overall increases or decreases.
Maximum and minimum pitch and maximum amplitude
served to describe increases in range that might not af-
fect overall average. We compared the segment-initial
?application change? utterances with their immediately
preceding segment-final utterances.3 We find significant
increases in maximum pitch ( fffiflffi !#"$!%'&

final cases. We also find highly significant decreases in
minimum pitch (%2& (*) (0(,(*. ) for segment-final utter-
ances relative to segment-initial utterances. Changes in
maximum amplitude did not reach significance. Figure 5
illustrates these changes.
6 Discussion
The significant increases in maximum and mean pitch
for segment-initial utterances, coupled with a decrease
in pitch minimum for segment-final utterances, suggest a
contrastive use of pitch range across the segment bound-
ary. For amplitude, there is a global increase in intensity.
These basic features of discourse segment-initial versus
discourse segment-final utterances are consistent with the

prior findings for monologue. It is interesting to note that
in spite of the less than fluent style of interaction imposed
on users by the prototype system, cues to discourse seg-
ment structure remain robust and consistent. We also ob-
serve that the contrasts across discourse segment bound-
aries are based on the speaker?s own baseline prosodic
behavior, rather than the conversational partner?s, at least
in this largely user-initiative system.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
Based on analysis of more than 450 discourse segment
boundary pairs, we found significant increases in max-
imum pitch, average pitch, and average intensity for
segment-initial utterances, with a significant decrease in
minimum pitch for segment-final utterances. Consistent
with prior work on human monologue, new discourse
segments in human-computer dialogue are signaled by in-
creases in pitch, contrastive use of pitch range, and loud-
ness, cues which could serve to attract the attention of the
other conversational participants.
In future work, we plan to apply these features to auto-
matic extraction of discourse boundaries and global dis-
course structure. These features could also be used in
conjunction with phonetic recognition results to enhance
confidence scoring for utterances that would cause a topic
shift. In systems such as SpeechActs where topic shift
often signals an application change, a somewhat time-
consuming activity as a new recognizer is swapped in
and new data loaded, it is desirable to have additional
implicit confirmation that such an action has in fact been
requested. Finally we hope to explore cues to more fine-
grained hierarchical discourse structure to distinguish full
topic shifts from initiation or completion of subdialogues.
