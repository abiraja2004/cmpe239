Abstract 
The present paper argues that the no- 
tion of "intonational structure" as formu- 
lated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and oth- 
ers, can be subsumed under the generalised 
notion of syntactic surface structure that 
emerges from a theory of grammar based 
on a "Combinatory" extension to Catego- 
rial Grammar. According to this theory, 
the syntactic structures and the intonation 
structures of English are identical, and have 
the same grammar. Some simplifications ap- 
pear to follow for the problem of integrating 
syntax and other high-level modules in spo- 
ken language systems. 
Phrasal intonation is notorious for structur- 
ing the words of spoken utterances into groups 
which frequently violate orthodox notions of con- 
stituency. For example, the normal prosody for 
the answer (b) to the following question (a) im- 
poses the intonational constituency indicated by 
the brackets (stress is indicated by capitals, and 
an indication of the perceived contour is given): 
*I am grateful to Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi, Mitch 
Marcus, Janet Pierrehurnbert, and Bonnie Lynn Webber 
for comments and advice. They should not be held respon- 
sible for any errors in the translation of their advice into 
the present framework. The present paper is a revised ver- 
sion of one that appears in the preliminary papers of the 
March 1989 AAAI symposium on Spoken Language Sys- 
tems, StarLford CA. An expanded version of the present 
paper appears as CIS Technical Report No. 89-20, Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania. The research was supported by

(1) a. I know that brassicas are a good 
source of minerals, but what are 
LEGumes a good source of? 
b. (LEGumes are a good source of) 
VITamins. 
Such a grouping cuts right across the traditional 
syntactic structure of the sentence. The presence 
of two apparently uncoupled levels of structure in 
natural language grammar appears to complicate 
the path from speech to interpretation unreason- 
ably, and to thereby threaten a number of compu- 
tational applications. 
Nevertheless, intonational structure is strongly 
constrained by meaning. Contours imposing 
bracketings like the following are not allowed: 
(2) ~ Three doctors (in ten prefer cats) 
tIalliday \[5\] seems to have been the first to iden- 
tify this phenomenon, which Selkirk \[12\] has called 
the "Sense Unit Condit ion", and to observe that 
this constraint seems to follow from the function 
of phrasal intonation, which is to convey distinc- 
tions of focus, information, and propositional at- 
t itude towards entities in the discourse. These en- 
tities are more diverse than mere nounphrase or 
propositional referents, but they do not include 
such non-concepts as "in ten prefer cats." 
One discourse category that they do include 
is what E. Prince \[11\] calls "open propositions". 
Open propositions are most easily understood as 
being that which is introduced into the discourse 
context by a Wh-question. So for example the 
question in (1), What are legumes a good source 
of? introduces an open proposition which it is 
most natural to think of as a functional abstrac- 
222 
tion, which would be written as follows in the no- 
tation of the X-calculus: 
(3) Az\[good'(sourcd z)legumes'\] 
(Primes indicate interpretations whose detailed 
semantics is of no direct concern here.) When 
this function or concept is supplied with an argu- 
ment vitamins', it reduces to give a proposition, 
with the same function argument relations as the 
canonical sentence: 
(4) good'(souree' vitaminsl)legumes ' 
It is the presence of the above open proposition 
that makes the intonation contour in (1) felicitous. 
(I am not claiming that its presence determines 
this response, nor that its presence is necessary 
for interpreting the response.) 
All natural languages include syntactic con- 
structions whose semantics is also reminiscent of 
functional abstraction. The most obvious and 
tractable class are Wh-constructions themselves, 
in which exactly the same fragments that can be 
delineated by a single intonation contour appear as 
the residue of the subordinate clause. But another 
and much more problematic lass are the frag- 
ments that result from coordinate constructions. 
It is striking that the residues of wh-movement and 
conjunction reduction are also subject to some- 
thing like a "sense unit condition". For example, 
strings like "in ten prefer cats" are not conjoin- 
able: 
(5) *Three doctors in ten prefer cats, 
and in twenty eat carrots. 
While coordinate constructions have constituted 
another major source of complexity for natural 
language understanding by machine, it is tempting 
to think that this conspiracy between syntax and 
prosody might point to a unified notion of struc- 
ture that is somewhat different from traditional 
surface constituency. 
Combinatory  Grammars .  
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, \[14\]) is 
an extension of Categorial Grammar (CG). Ele- 
ments like verbs are associated with a syntactic 
"category" which identifies them as functions, and 
specifies the type and directionality of their argu- 
ments and the type of their result: 
(6) eats : -  (S\~IP)/NP: eat '  
The category can be regarded as encoding the se- 
mantic type of their translation. Such functions 
can combine with arguments of the appropriate 
type and position by functional application: 
(7) Harry eats apples 
NP (S\NP)/I'P NP 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  > 
S\NP 
< 
S 
Because the syntactic functional type is identical 
to the semantic type, apart from directionality, 
this derivation also builds a compositional inter- 
pretation, eats'apples'harry', and of course such 
a "pure" categorial grammar is context free. Co- 
ordination might be included in CG via the fol- 
lowing rule, allowing any constituents of like type, 
including functions, to form a single constituent of 
the same type: 
(8) X conj X =~ X 
(9) I cooked and ate a frog 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
NP (s\NP)/gP conj (S\~P)/~P NP 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
CS\~P)/~P 
(The rest of the derivation is omitted, being the 
same as in (7).) In order to allow coordination 
of contiguous trings that do not constitute con- 
stituents, CCG generalises the grammar to allow 
certain operations on functions related to Curry's 
combinators \[3\]. For example, functions may com- 
pose, as well as apply, under the following rule 
(10) Forward Composition: 
X/Y  : F Y /Z  : C =~. X /Z  : Az F(Gz) 
The most important single property of combina- 
tory rules like this is that they have an invari- 
ant semantics. This one composes the interpre- 
tations of the functions that it applies to, as is 
223 
apparent from the right hand side of the rule. x 
Thus sentences like I cooked, and might eat, the 
beans can be accepted, via the following composi- 
tion of two verbs (indexed as B, following Curry's 
nomenclature) to yield a composite of the same 
category as a transitive verb. Crucially, compo- 
sition also yields the appropriate interpretation, 
assuming that a semantics i  also provided for the 
coordination rule. 
(11) cooked and might  eat  
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
(S\NP)/NP conj (S\~P)/VP VP/NP 
............... >B 
(S\NP)/NP 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
(S\NP)/NP 
Combinatory grammars also include type-raising 
rules, which turn arguments into functions over 
functions-over-such-arguments. These rules al- 
low arguments to compose, and thereby take part 
in coordinations like I cooked, and you ate, the 
legumes. They too have an invariant composi- 
tionai semantics which ensures that the result has 
an appropriate interpretation. For example, the 
following rule allows the conjuncts to form as be- 
low (again, the remainder of the derivation is omit- 
ted): 
(12) Subject Type-raising: 
NP : y :-~ S / (S \NP)  : AF Fy

Slip 
This theory has been explicitly addressed to a wide 
range of coordination phenomena in a number of 
languages \[4\], \[13\]. 
a The  rule uses the notat ion of the A-calculus in the se- 
mant ics,  for clarity. This  should not  obscure the fact that  
it is funct ional  composit ion itself that  is the primitive, not 
the A operator.  
I n tonat ion  in  a CCG.  
Inspection of the above examples hows that Com- 
binatory grammars embody an unusual view of 
surface structure, according to which strings like 
Betty might eat are constituents. In fact, ac- 
cording to this view, surface structure is a much 
more ambiguous affair than is generally realised, 
for they must also be possible constituents of 
non-coordinate s ntences like Betty might eat the 
mushrooms, as well. (See \[7\] and \[15\] for a dis- 
cussion of the obvious problems that this fact en- 
genders for parsing written text.) An entirely un- 
constrained combinatory grammar would in fact 
allow more or less any bracketing on a sentence. 
However, the actual grammars we write for con- 
figurational languages like English are heavily con- 
strained by local conditions. (An example would 
be a condition on the composition rule that is tac- 
itly assumed here, forbidding the variable Y to 
be instantiated as NP, thus excluding constituents 
like *\[eat he\]vp/g). 
The claim of the present paper is simply that 
particular surface structures that are induced by 
the specific combinatory grammar that was in- 
troduced to explain coordination in English are 
identical to the intonational structures that are 
required to specify the possible intonation con- 
tours for those same sentences of English. More 
specifically, the claim is that that in spoken utter- 
ance, intonation largely determines which of the 
many possible bracketings permitted by the com- 
binatory syntax of English is intended, and that 
the interpretations of the constituents are related 
to distinctions of focus among the concepts and 
open propositions that the speaker has in mind. 
Thus, whatever problems for parsing written text 
arise from the profusion of equivalent alternative 
surface structures engendered by this theory, these 
"spurious" ambiguities eem to be to a great ex- 
tent resolved by prosody in spoken language. The 
theory therefore offers the possibility that phonol- 
ogy and parsing can be merged into a single uni- 
tary process. 
The proof of this claim lies in showing that 
the rules of combinatory grammar can be anno- 
tated with intonation contour schemata, which 
limit their application in spoken discourse, and to 
224 
showing that the major constituents of intonated 
utterances like (1)b, under the analyses that these 
rules permit correspond to the focus structure of 
the context o which they are appropriate, such as 
(1)a. 
I shall use a notation which is based on 
the theory of Pierrehumbert \[8\], as modified in 
more recent work by Selkirk \[12\], Beckman and 
eierrehumbert \[1\], \[9\], and Pierrehumbert and 
Hirschberg \[10\]. I have tried as far as possible to 
take my examples and the associated intonational 
annotations from those authors. 
I follow Pierrehumbert in assuming two abstract 
pitch levels, and three types of tones, as follows. 
There are two phrasal tones, written H and L, de- 
noting high or low "simple" tones - -  that is, level 
functions of pitch against time. There are also 
two boundary tones, written H~ and L~, denoting 
an intonational phrase-final rise or fall. Of Pier- 
rhumberts ix pitch accent tones, I shall only be 
concerned with two, the H* accent and the L+H*. 
The phonetic or acoustic realisation of pitch ac- 
cents is a complex matter. Roughly speaking, the 
L+H* pitch accent hat is extensively discussed be- 
low in the context of the L+H* LH~ melody gener- 
ally appears as a maximum which is preceded by 
a distinctive low level, and peaks later than the 
corresponding H* pitch accent when the same se- 
quence is spoken with the H* L melody that goes 
with "new" information, and which is the other 
melody considered below. 
In the more recent versions of the theory, Pier- 
rehumbert and her colleagues distinguish Iwo lev- 
els of prosodic phrase that include a pitch accent 
tone. They are the intonational phrase proper, 
and the "intermediate phrase". Both end in a 
phrasal tone, but only intonational phrases have 
additional boundary tones H~ and L~. Interme- 
diate phrases are bounded on the right by their 
phrasal tone alone, and do not appear to be char- 
acterised in F0 by the same kind of final rise or fall 
that is characteristic of true intonational phrases. 
The distinction does not play an active role in the 
prosent account, but I shall follow the more recent 
notation of prosodic phrase boundaries in the ex- 
amples, without further comment on the distinc- 
tion. 
There may also be parts of prosodic phrases 
where the fundamental frequency is merely inter- 
polated between tones, notably the region between 
pitch accent and phrasal tone, and the region be- 
fore a pitch accent. In Pierrehumbert's notation, 
such substrings bear no indication of abstract one 
whatsoever. 
A crucial feature of this theory for present pur- 
poses is that the position and shape of a given 
pitch accent in a prosodic phrase, and of its phrase 
accent and the associated right-hand boundary, 
are essentially invariant. If the constituent is very 
short - say, a monosyllabic nounphrase - then the 
whole intonational contour may be squeezed onto 
that one syllable. If the constituent is longer, then 
the pitch accent will appear at its left edge, the 
phrasal tone and boundary tone if any will appear 
at its right edge, and the intervening pitch con- 
tour will merely be interpolated. In this way, the 
tune can be spread over longer or shorter strings, 
in order to mark the corresponding constituents 
for the particular distinction of focus and propo- 
sitional attitude that the melody denotes. 
Consider for example the prosody of the sen- 
tence Fred ate the beans in the following pair of 
discourse settings, which are adapted from Jack- 
endoff \[6, pp. 260\]: 
(14) Q: Well, what about the BEAns? 
Who ate THEM? 
A: FRED ate the BEA-ns. 
H*L L+H*LHY, 
(15) Q: Well, what about FRED? 
What did HE eat? 
A: FRED ate the BEAns. 
L+H* LHY, B* LLYo 
In these contexts, the main stressed syllables on 
both Fred and the beans receive a pitch accent, 
but a different one. In (14), the pitch accent con- 
tour on Fred is H*, while that on beans is L+H*. 
(I base these annotations on Pierrehumbert and 
Hirschberg's \[10, ex. 33\] discussion of this exam- 
pie.) 
In the second example (15) above, the pitch 
accents are reversed: this time Fred is L+H* and 
beans is H*. The assignment of these tones seem 
to reflect the fact that (as Pierrehumbert and 
Hirschberg point out) H* is used to mark infor- 
mation that the speaker believes to be new to the 
225 
hearer. In contrast, L+H* seems to be used to mark 
information which the current speaker knows to be 
given to the hearer (because the current hearer 
asked the original question), but which consti- 
tutes a novel topic of conversation for the speaker, 
standing in a contrastive relation to some other 
given information, constituting the previous topic. 
(If the information were merely given, it would re- 
ceive no tone in Pierrehumbert's terms - -  or be 
left out altogether.) Thus in (15), the L+H* LIIZ 
phrase including this accent is spread across the 
phrase Fred ate. 2 Similarly, in (14), the same tune 
is confined to the object of the open proposition 
ate the beans, because the intonation of the origi- 
nal question indicates that eating beans as opposed 
to some other comestible is the new topic. 
Syntax-driven Prosody. 
The L+H# LHZ intonational melody in example 
(15) belongs to a phrase Fred ate ... which cor- 
responds under the combinatory theory of gram- 
mar to a grammatical constituent, complete with 
a translation equivalent o the open proposition 
Ax\[(ate' z) fred'\]. The combinatory theory thus 
offers a way to assign intonation contours entirely 
under the control of independently motivated rules 
of grammar. In particular, the forward composi- 
tion rule (10) offers the possibility of limiting the 
construction of non-standard constituents accord- 
ing to the intonation contours on the composed 
elements. 
I show elsewhere that this effect can be achieved 
using a simple annotation of the composition rule 
capturing the injuction "Don't compose across an 
intonational phrase or intermediate phrase bound- 
ary". Application is not constrained by intona- 
tion, and all rules mark their result with the con- 
catenation of the intonation contour on their in- 
puts. The annotated composition rule correctly 
allows the derivation of the non-standard con- 
stituent Fred ate in example (15), where it is 
2An alternat ive prosody, in which the contrastive tune 
is confined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and  may be the 
one intended by Jackendoff. I believe that  this alternative 
is informational ly dist inct,  and arises f rom an ambiguity as 
to whether  the topic of this discourse is Fred or What Fred 
ate. It is accepted by the present rules. 
marked with L+H* LHY,, because this string does 
not include an internal phrase boundary. It will 
also accept strings in which the same contour is 
spread over more lengthy open propositions, uch 
as Fred must have eaten ..., as in (FRED must 
have ealen)(the BEAns). However, the same rule 
correctly forbids the derivation of such a con- 
stituent in example (14), because Fred is marked 
as H.L, ending in an intermediate phrase bound- 
ary, and thus cannot compose with the material to 
its right. Other examples considered by Jackend- 
off are also accepted by these rules, to yield only 
the contextually appropriate interpretations. 
Conclusion. 
According to the present theory, the pathway 
between phonological form and interpretation is
much simpler than has been thought up till now. 
Phonological Form maps directly onto Surface 
Structure, via rules of combinatory grammar an- 
notated with abstract intonation contours. Sur- 
face Structure is identical to intonational struc- 
ture, and maps directly onto Focus Structure, 
in which focussed and backgrounded entities and 
open propositions ar'e represented by functional 
abstractions and arguments. Such structures re- 
duce to yield canonical Function-Argument S ruc- 
tures. The proposal thus represents a return to the 
architecture proposed by Chomsky \[2\] and Jack- 
endoff \[6\]. The difference is that the concept of 
surface structure has changed. It now really is 
only surface structure, supplemented by "annota- 
tions" which do nothing more than indicate the in- 
formation structural status and intonational tune 
of constituents at that level. 
While many problems remain, both in pars- 
ing written text with grammars that include as- 
sociative operations, and at the signal-processing 
end, the benefits for automatic spoken language 
understanding are likely to be significant. Most 
obviously, where in the past parsing and phono- 
logical processing have delivered conflicting struc- 
tural analyses, and have had to be pursued in- 
dependently, they now are seen to be in con- 
cert. Processors can therefore be devised which 
use both sources of information at once, thus sim- 
plifying both problems. (For example, intonation 
226 
may largely determine syntactic structure in the \[8\] 
present sense. And a syntactic analysis that is 
so closely related to the structure of the signal 
should be easier to use to "filter" the ambiguities 
arising from lexical recognition.) What is likely 
to be more important in the long run, however, is 
that the constituents hat arise under this analy- \[9\] 
sis are also semantically interpreted. The paper 
has argued that these interpretations are directly 
related to the concepts, referents and themes that \[10\] 
have been established in the context of discourse, 
say as the result of a question. The shortening 
and simplification of the path from speech to these 
higher levels of analysis offers the possibility of us- 
ing those probably more effective resources to filter \[11\] 
the proliferation of low level analyses as well.
