ABSTRACT
We describe an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) sys-
tem and the adaptations and enhancementsmade to create a Chinese-
English translation system from the Hong Kong legal code and var-
ious other bilingual resources available from the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC).
1. BACKGROUND
We describe an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT)
system and the adaptations and enhancements made to create a
Chinese-English translation system from the Hong Kong legal code
and various other bilingual resources available from the Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC).
The EBMT software [1, 3] used for the experiments described
here is a shallow system which can function using nothing more
than sentence-alignedplaintext and a bilingual dictionary; and given
sufficient parallel text, the dictionary can be extracted statistically
from the corpus [2]. To perform a translation, the program looks up
all matching phrases in the source-language half of the parallel cor-
pus and performs a word-level alignment on the entries containing
matches to determine a (usually partial) translation. Portions of the
input for which there are no matches in the corpus do not generate
a translation.
Because the EBMT system does not generate translations for
100% of the text it is given as input, a bilingual dictionary and
phrasal glossary are used to fill any gaps. Selection of a ?best?
translation is guided by a trigram model of the target language [6].
Supporting Chinese required a number of changes to the program
and training procedures; those changes are discussed in the next
section.
2. ENHANCEMENTS
The first change required of the translation software was sup-
port for the two-byte encoding used for the Chinese text (GB-2312,
?GB? for short). Further, the EBMT (as well as dictionary and glos-
sary) approaches are word-based, but Chinese is ordinarily writ-
ten without breaks between words. Thus, Chinese input must be
.
segmented into individual words. The initial baseline system used
the segmenter made available by the LDC. This segmenter uses a
word-frequency list to make segmentation decisions, but although
the list provided by the LDC is large, it did not completely cover
the vocabulary of the EBMT training corpus (described below). As
a result, many sentences had incorrect segmentations or included
long sequences which were not segmented at all or were broken
into single characters. Almost every Chinese character has at least
one meaning, and its meaning may be entirely different from the
meaning of the word containing it. The mis-segmenting of Chinese
words due to the inadequate dictionary makes it very hard to build
a statistical dictionary and properly index the EBMT corpus.
To improve the performance of the Chinese segmenter, we aug-
mented its word list by finding sequences of characters in the train-
ing corpus that belong together, based on their frequency and high
mutual information. We developed a form of term extraction to
find English phrases which should be treated as atomic units for
translation, thus increasing the average length of ?words? in both
source and target languages. Finally, we also created an augmented
bilingual dictionary for use in word-level alignment for EBMT by
applying statistical dictionary extraction techniques to the training
corpus.
As the improved segmenter and the term finder may be produc-
ing excessively long phrases or phrases which are impossible to
match in the other language, we repeat the procedure of segment-
ing/bracketing/dictionary-building several times. On each succes-
sive iteration, the segmenter and bracketer are limited to words and
phrases for which the statistical dictionary from the previous itera-
tion contains translations. Through this iteration, we increased the
size of the statistical dictionary from each step and guaranteed that
all Chinese words generated by the segmenter have translations in
the dictionary. This helps ensure that the EBMT engine can per-
form word-level alignments.
3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The primary purpose of this experiment was to determine the
effect of each enhancement by operating with various subsets of
the enhancements. Since it rapidly becomes impractical to test all
possible combinations, we opted for the following test conditions:
1. baseline: parallel corpus segmented with the LDC segmenter
and LDC dictionary/glossary
2. baseline plus improved segmenter
3. baseline plus improved segmenter and term finder
4. baseline plus improved segmenter and statistical dictionary
5. baseline plus improved segmenter, term finder, and statistical
dictionary
For training, we had available two parallel Chinese-English cor-
pora distributed by the LDC: the complete Hong Kong legal code
(after cleaning: 47.86 megabytes, 5.5 million English words, 9 mil-
lion Chinese characters) where 85% of the content (by sentence) is
unique, and a collection of Hong Kong news articles (after clean-
ing: 24.58 megabytes, 2.67 million English words, 4.5 million Chi-
nese characters). In addition, LDC distributes a bilingual dictio-
nary/phrasebook, which we also used.
To determine the effects of varying amounts of training data on
overall performance, we divided the bilingual training corpus into
ten nearly equal slices. Each test condition was then run ten times,
each time increasing the number of slices used for training the sys-
tem. After each training pass, the test sentences were translated and
the system?s performance evaluated automatically; selected points
were then manually evaluated for translation quality.
The automatic performance evaluation measured coverage of the
input and average phrase length. Coverage is the percentage of the
input text for which a translation is produced by a particular trans-
lation method (since the EBMT engine does not generally produce
hypotheses that cover every word of input), while average phrase
length is a crude indication of translation quality ? the longer the
phrase that is translated, the more context is incorporated and the
less likely it is that the wrong sense will be used in the translation or
that (for EBMT) the alignment will be incorrect. Since the dictio-
nary and glossary remain constant for a given test condition, only
the EBMT coverage will be presented.
Manual grading of the output was performed using a web-based
system with which the graders could assign one of three scores
(?Good?, ?OK?, ?Bad?) in each of two dimensions: grammatical
correctness and meaning preservation. This type of quality scoring
is commonly used in assessing translation quality, and is used by
other TIDES participants. Fifty-two test sentences were translated
for each of four points from the automated evaluation and these sets
of four alternatives presented to the graders. The four points chosen
were the baseline system with 100% of the training corpus, the full
system with 20% and 100% training, and the full system trained on
a corpus of Hong Kong news text (cross-domain); only four points
were selected due to the difficulty and expense of obtaining large
numbers of manual quality judgements.
To assess the performance of the system in a different domain,
as well as the effect of the trigram language model on the selec-
tion of translated fragments for the final translation, we obtained
manual judgements for 44 sentences on an additional four test con-
ditions, each trained with the entire available parallel text and tested
on Hong Kong news text rather than legal sentences. These points
were the cross-domain case (trained on the legal corpus) and three
different language models for within-domain training: an English
language model derived from the legal corpus, one derived from
the news corpus, and a pre-existing model generated from two gi-
gabytes of newswire and broadcast news transcriptions.
4. RESULTS
We discovered that there is a certain amount of synergy between
some of the improvements, particularly the term finder and statis-
tical dictionary extraction. Applying the term finder modifies the
parallel corpus in such a way that it becomes more difficult for
the EBMT engine to find matches which it can align, while adding
dictionary entries derived from the modified corpus eliminates that
effect. As a result, we will not present the performance results for
Test Condition 3 (improved segmenter plus term finder); further,
the data for Test Conditions 2 (improved segmenter only) and 4
(improved segmenter plus statistical dictionary) may not accurately
reflect the contribution of those two components to the full system

used for Test Condition 5.
Figure 2 shows the proportion of the words in the test sentences
for which the EBMT engine was able to produce a translation,
while Figure 3 shows the average number of source-languagewords
per translated fragment. These curves do not increase monotoni-
cally because, for performance reasons, the EBMT engine does not
attempt to align every occurrence of a phrase, only theN (currently
12) most-recently added ones; as a result, adding more text to the
corpus can cause EBMT to ignore matches that successfully align
in favor of newer occurrences which it is unable to align.
Examining Figure 3, it is clear that the fifth slice (from 40 to
50%) is much more like the test data than other slices, resulting in
longer matches. In general, the closer training and test text are to
each other, the longer the phrases they have in common.
Figure 1 summarizes the results of human quality assessments.
The ?Good? and ?OK? judgements were combined into ?Accept-
able? and the the percentage of ?Acceptable? judgements was aver-
aged across sentences and graders. As hoped and expected, the im-
provements do in fact result not only in better coverage by EBMT,
but also in better quality assessments by the human graders. Fur-
ther, the results on Hong Kong news text show that the choice of
language model does have a definite effect on quality. These results
also confirm the adage that there is no such thing as too much train-
ing text for language modeling, since the model generated from the
EBMT corpus was unable to match the performance of the pre-
existing model generated from two orders of magnitude more text.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
As seen in Figure 2, the enhancements described here cumula-
tively provide a 12% absolute improvement in coverage for EBMT
translations without requiring any additional knowledge resources.
Further, the enhanced coverage does, in fact, result in improved
translations, as verified by human judgements. We can also con-
clude that when we combine words into larger chunks on both sides
of the corpus, the possibility of finding larger matches between the
source language and the target language increases, which leads to
the improvement of the translation quality for EBMT.
We will do further research on the interaction between the im-
proved segmenter, term finder and statistical dictionary builder, uti-
lizing the information provided by the statistical dictionary as feed-
back for the segmenter and term finder to modify their results. We
are also investigating the effects of splitting the EBMT training into
multiple sets of topic-specific sentences, automatically separated
using clustering techniques.
The relatively low slope of the coverage curve also indicates that
the training corpus is sufficiently large. Our prior experience with

Figure 2: EBMT Coverage with Varying Training
the Hansard corpus [7]) was that the curve flattens out at between
two and three million words of training text, which appears also to
be the case for Chinese (each training slice contains approximately
one million words of total text).
We have not yet taken full advantage of the features of the EBMT
software. In particular, it supports equivalence classes that permit
generalization of the training text into templates for improved cov-
erage. We intend to test automatic creation of equivalence classes
from the training corpus [4] in conjunction with the other improve-
ments reported herein.
