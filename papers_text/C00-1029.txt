Abstract  
Knowledge of which words are able to fill p~rtic- 
ular argum.ent slots of a predicate can be used 
tbr structural disambiguation. This paper de- 
scribes a proposal :for acquiring such knowledge, 
and in line with much of the recent work in this 
area, a probabilistic approach is taken. We de- 
velop a novel way of using a semantic hierar- 
chy to estimate the probabilities, and demon- 
strate the general approach using a preposi- 
tional phrase atta.chment experiment. 
1 Introduction 
Knowledge of which words are able to fill 
particular a.rgument slots of a. l?redlca.te ca,n 
be used tbr structural disa.mbiguation. In 
the following example (Charnial~, 1993), the 
fact that dog, rather than prize, is often 
the su.1)ject of r'lm, can t)e used to decide 
on the attachment site of the relative clause: 
Fred awarded a prize for the dog that ran the fastest 
We describe a proposal for acquiring such 
knowledge, and as in other recent work in this 
area (Resnik, 1993; l,i and Abe, t998), a prob- 
abilistic approach is taken. Using probabilities 
accords with the intuition that there are no ab- 
solute constraints on the arguments of predi- 
cates, bu.t rather that constraints are satisfied 
to a certain degree (Resnik, 1993). Unfortu- 
nately, defining probabilities in terms of words 
leads to a model with a vast number of param- 
eters, resulting in a sparse data problem. To 
overcome this, we propose to define a probabil- 
ity model in terms of senses from a semantic hi- 
erarchy, exploiting the fact that senses of nouns 
can be grouped together into semantically sim- 
ilar classes. 
We use the semantic hierarchy of noun senses 
in WordNet (Fellbamn, 1.998), which consists of 
qexicalised concepts' related by the qs-a-kind- 
of' relation. If c' is a kind of c, then c is a hy- 
pcrnym of c', and c' a hyponym of c. Counts are 
passed u.p the hierarchy fl'om the senses of nouns 
appearing in the data. Thus if cat chicl~cn a.p- 
pears in the data, th.e count for this item passes 
u\]) to (meat}, (good}, and all the other hyper- 
nyms of that sense of chicken. 1 In. order to es- 
timate the probability that a sense of chichcn 
~tppea.rs as the object of the verb cat, we repre- 
sent (chicken} using a. suitable hypern3qn , such 
as (:eood), and base our probability estimate on 
that instead. The level at which (chicken) is 
represented is cruciah it should be high enough 
for adequate counts to have accumulated, but 
not too high so that the hypernym is no longer 
representat ive  of (chicken}.  An exanlp le  of a 
hypernym whidl would be too high is (e r t t i ty ) ,  
as not all entities are semantically similar with 
respect o the object position ot7 cat. 
The problem of choosing an appropria.te l vel 
in the h.ierarchy at which to represent a par- 
ticular noun sense (given a predicate and argu- 
ment position) has been investigated by Resnik 
(1993), Li and Abe (1998) and ll,iba,s (1995). 
The learning mechanism presented \]lore is a 
novel approach based on tinding semantically 
similar sets of concepts in a hierarchy. We 
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach 
using a PP-attachment experiment.

195 
proposM is to estilnate P(eatl(~h?cken>, oh j) us- 
ing  p(eat\](food), oh j), or something similar. The 
following proposition shows that if p(vlc" , r) is 
I 
the same for each c" in c ' ,  where c' is some 
hypernym of c, then p(v\]c', r) will be equal to 
p(v\[c, r):

So in order to estimate p(v\[c,r), we need a 
way of searching for a set c', where c' is a hy- 
pernym of c, which consists of concepts c" which 
have similar p(v\]c", r). Of conrse we cannot ex- 
pect to find a set consisting of concepts which 
have identical p(vlc", r), which the proposition 
strictly requires, but if the p(vlc" , 7") are simila.r, 
then we can expect p(vld , r) to be a. reasonable 
estimate of p(vlc , 7"). We refer to the set c' as 
the %imilarity-class' of c, and the suitable hy- 
pernym, c l, as top(c, v, r). The next section ex- 
plains how we determine similarity classes. The 
maxim.urn likelihood estimates for the relevant

First we explain how we determine if a set of 
concepts has similar p(vlc", r) for each concept 
c" in the set. Then we explain how we determine 
top(c, v, r). 
4Since we are a.ssuming the data. is not sense dis- 
a.mbiguated, f,:eq(c, v, r) cannot be obtained by sim- 
ply counting senses. The standard approach, which is 
adopted here, is to estimate fl'eq(c, v, r) by distributing 
the count tor each noun n in syn(c) evenly among all 
senses of the noun. Yarowsky (1992) and \]{esnik (1993) 
explain how the noise introduced by this technique tends 
to dissipate as counts are passed up the hierarchy.

Tile method used for comparing the p(vlc" , r) 
for c" in some set c', is based on the technique 
ill Clark and Weir (1999) used for tinding homo- 
geneous ets of concepts in the WordNet noun 
hierarchy. Rather than directly compare esti- 
mates ofp(vlc" , r), which are likely to be unreli- 
able, we consider the children of c', and use esti- 
mates based on counts which have accumulated 
I , /  , /  at the children. If c' has children Q,%, . . . ,  c,,,,, 
I 
we compare e'(~l<, ") for each i. Th~s is an 
I 
a.pproximation, but if the p(vlc}, r) arc similar, 
I 
then we assume that the p(vlc" ,r)  for c" in c' 
are similar too. 
To deterlnine whether the children of some 
? . , ./is the hyperny,~ c' have simila,' \]'('~'14) where c~ 
ith child, we apply a X 2 test to a contingency 
tM)le of frequency counts. Table 2 shows some 
e?a.mple frequencies for c' equM to (nutriment), 
in the ol)ject position of cat. The figures in 
brackets are the expected values, based on the 
marginal totMs in the table. The null hypoth- 
esis of the test is that p(vl@ r ) i s  the same for 
each i. libr TM)1e 2 the null hypothesis is tlmt 
,I tbr every child, ci, of (nutr?ment}, the probabil- 
ity p(catlc~, obj) is the same. 
The log-likelihood X 2 statistic corresponding 
to TM)le 2 is 4.8. The log-likelihood X 2 statistic 
is used rather than the Pearson's X 2 statistic 
because it is thought to be more appropriate 
when the counts in the contingency table are 
low (\])unning, 1993). This tends to occur when 
the test is being applied to a set of concepts 
near the foot of the hierarchy, s We compared 
5Fisher,s exa.ct test could be used for tables with low 
counts, but we do not do so because tables dolninated 
by low counts are likely to have a. high percentage of 
noise, due to the way counts for a noun are split ~unong

would not be rejected.

Th(; next section provides evidence that tile 
technique for choosing lOl)(C , v, r), which we call 
the 'simihu'ity-class' technique, does select an 
appropriate level of generalisation.

,u,d ~,,(c.z,,l,,.,), who,;o ,~ ~ ~,l(,+~). Th is  . lea, is  
that for many predicate/prel)osition combina- 
tions which occur infl'equently in the d~ta., there 
are few examples of n2 which ca.n be used lot 
populating Wo7'dNet in these cases. Despite 
this, we were still able to carry out an ewl.lu- 
ation by considering subsets of the test (ta.ta for 
which the relewmt predicate~preposition com- 
I)inations did occur frequently in tit(; training 
d at a,. 
We deckle on tile a.tta('hnmnt site by compar- 
197 
ing p(c~, pr\[v) and p(c,~,, p,'\],q), where 
= a rg n ax l,(c,p,'lv) 
c,z 1 = arg max p(c, prlTq ) 
The sense of n2 is chosen which maximises 
the relevant probability in each potential at- 
tachment case. If p(c,,,p,jv)is greater than 
1)(%, :m'l~l), the attachment is made to v, oth- 
erwise to nl. If n2 is not in WordNet we com- 
pare p(prlv ) and p(prl~t~). Probabilities of the 
form p(c, prlv ) and p(c, prl~tl ) are used rather 
than p(clv,pr ) and p(cl~l,p,j, because the as- 
sociation between the preposition and v and ~q 
contains useful information. In fact, for a lot 
of cases this intbrmation alone can be used to 
decide on the correct attachment site_ The orig- 
inal corpus-based method of \]Jindle and ll.ooth 
(1993) used exactly this information. Thus the 
method described here can be thought of as Hin- 
dle and Rooth's method with additional class- 
based information about n2. 
In order to estimate p(c,, ,pr lv)(and 
p(C,~l,ln'l,,,,)) we apply the same procedure 
as described in Section 3, first rewriting the 
probability using Bayes' rule: 
p,,.)p(c,,, p,.) p (c , , , j , , l v ) - -  p(vlcv, v(v) 
p,.) !'(P'q c,, ) 
: p(dc,,, l,(v) 
The probabilities p(c.~) and p(v) can be es- 
timated using maximum likelihood estimates, 
a.nd p(vlcv, p,' ) and j,(p,'lc,) can be esti- 
m.ated using maximum likelihood estimates of 
p(vltop(c~ ,v,p,'),pr) and p(prltop(%,pr)) re- 
spectively. 6 
We used the training and test data described 
in l/.atn.aparkhi et al (1994:), which, was taken 
Doln the Penn %:eebank and has now become 
the standard data set for this task. The data 
set consists of tuples of the form (v, ~zl, p~', n2), 
together with the attachment site for each tu- 
ple. There is also a development set to prevent 
implicit training on the test set during develop- 
ment. \~e extracted (v, pr, '~2) and (hi, pr, ,z2) 
~ln Section 4 we only gave the procedure for deter- 
mining top(c~, v, pr), but top(c~, pr) can be determined 
in an analogous fashion. 
triples from the training set, and in order to in- 
crease the number of training triples, we also 
extracted triples Kern unambiguous cases of at- 
tachlnent in the Penn %'eebank. We prepro- 
cessed the training and test data by \]emmatising 
the words, replacing numerical amounts with 
the words ~definite_quantity', replacing mone- 
tary amounts with the words 'sum_olLmoney' 
etc. We then ignored those triples in the re- 
sulting training set (but not test set) for which 
7z2 was not in WordNet, which left a total of 
66,881 triples of training data.. The test set 
contains 3,097 examples. 
Table 3 gives seine examples of the ex- 
tent to which the similarity-class technique 
is generalising, using the training data just 
described, and a significance level of 0.05. 
The chosen hypernym is shown in Ul)per 
case. Note that the WordNet hierarchy con- 
sists of nine separate sub-hierarchies, headed 
by such concepts  as (ent i ty>,  (abst rac t ion) ,  
(psycho log ica l~eature) ,  bnt  we assume the ex- 
istence of a single root which dominates each 
of the sub-hierarchies, which is referred to as 
(root>. In cases where WordNet is very sparsely 
populated, it is preferable to go to (root), 
rather than stay at the root of one of the sub- 
hierarchies where the data may be noisy or too 
sparse to be o\[' any use. The table shows that 
with the amount of data ava.ilable from the Tree- 
bank, the similarity-class technique is selecting 
a. level at or close to (root> in many cases. 
We compared the similarity-class technique 
with fixing the level of generalisation. Two tixed 
levels were used: the root of the entire hieraJ'- 
chy ((root>), and the set consisting of the roots 
of each of the 9 sul>hierarchies. The procedure 
which always selects (root} ignores any informa-

p(prlv ) and p(prl ,h),  which is the ltindle and 
Rooth approach. The results on the 3,097 test 
cases are shown in Table 4. We used a. signifi- 
cance level a of 0.05 tbr the X 2 test. r
As the table shows, the disambiguation ac- 
curacy is below the state of the art. However, 
the results are comparable with those of l,i and 
rSimilar results were obtained using alternative l vels 
of signifiea.nce. Rather than simply selecting a value for 
a, such as 0.05, a' can be tree,ted as a parameter of the 
model, whose optimum value caJl be obtained by running 
the disambiguation method on some held-out supervised 
data.

We have shown that when instances of Word- 
Net are well populated with examples of 
n2, the method described here for solving 
P1)-attachment ambiguities is highly accurate. 
When WordNet is sparsely populated, the 
method automatically resorts to comparing just 
the preposition and each of the potential attach- 
ment sites, as the similarity-class technique will 
select {root} as the appropriate l vel of general- 
\]sat\]on for n2 in such cases. We have also shown 
the similarity-class technique to be superior to 
using a fixed level of general\]sat\]on in WordNet. 
Further work will look at how to integrate 
probabilities uch as p(clv, r) into a model of 
dependency structure, similar to that of Collins 
(1996) and Collins (1997), which can be used 
\['or parse selection. However, knowledge of se- 
\]ectional preferences cannot by itself solve the 
problem of structural disambiguation, and this 
further work will also look at using additional 
knowledge, such a.s subcategorisation informa- 
tion.
