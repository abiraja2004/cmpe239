Abstract 
This paper explores an automatic WordNet 
synset assignment to the bi-lingual diction-
aries of languages having limited lexicon 
information. Generally, a term in a bi-
lingual dictionary is provided with very 
limited information such as part-of-speech, 
a set of synonyms, and a set of English 
equivalents. This type of dictionary is 
comparatively reliable and can be found in 
an electronic form from various publishers. 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for 
applying a set of criteria to assign a synset 
with an appropriate degree of confidence to 
the existing bi-lingual dictionary. We show 
the efficiency in nominating the synset 
candidate by using the most common lexi-
cal information. The algorithm is evaluated 
against the implementation of Thai-
English, Indonesian-English, and Mongo-
lian-English bi-lingual dictionaries. The 
experiment also shows the effectiveness of 
using the same type of dictionary from dif-
ferent sources.  
1 Introduction 
The Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) 
is one of the most semantically rich English lexical 
databases that are widely used as a lexical knowl-
edge resource in many research and development 
topics. The database is divided by part of speech 
into noun, verb, adjective and adverb, organized in 
sets of synonyms, called synset, each of which 
represents ?meaning? of the word entry.  
Though WordNet was already used as a starting 
resource for developing many language WordNets, 
the construction of the WordNet for any languages 
can be varied according to the availability of the 
language resources. Some were developed from 
scratch, and some were developed from the combi-
nation of various existing lexical resources. Span-
ish and Catalan WordNets, for instance, are auto-
matically constructed using hyponym relation, 
monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary and 
taxonomy (Atserias et al, 1997). Italian WordNet 
(Magnini et al, 1994) is semi-automatically con-
structed from definition in monolingual dictionary, 
bilingual dictionary, and WordNet glosses. Hun-
garian WordNet uses bilingual dictionary, mono-
lingual explanatory dictionary, and Hungarian the-
saurus in the construction (Proszeky et al, 2002), 
etc.

This paper presents a new method particularly to 
facilitate the WordNet construction by using the 
existing resources having only English equivalents 
and the lexical synonyms. Our proposed criteria 
and algorithm for application are evaluated by im-
plementing to Asian languages which occupy quite 
different language phenomena in terms of gram-
mars and word unit. 
To evaluate our criteria and algorithm, we use 
the PWN version 2.1 containing 207,010 senses 
classified into adjective, adverb, verb, and noun. 
The basic building block is a ?synset? which is 
essentially a context-sensitive grouping of syno-
nyms which are linked by various types of relation 
such as hyponym, hypernymy, meronymy, anto-
nym, attributes, and modification. Our approach is 
conducted to assign a synset to a lexical entry by 
considering its English equivalent and lexical 
synonyms. The degree of reliability of the assign-
ment is defined in terms of confidence score (CS) 
based on our assumption of the membership of the 
English equivalent in the synset. A dictionary from 
different source is also a reliable source to increase 
the accuracy of the assignment because it can ful-
fill the thoroughness of the list of English equiva-
lent and the lexical synonyms. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 describes our criteria for synset assign-
ment. Section 3 provides the results of the experi-
ments and error analysis on Thai, Indonesian, and 
Mongolian. Section 4 evaluates the accuracy of the 
assignment result, and the effectiveness of the 
complimentary use of a dictionary from different 
sources. Section 5 shows a collaborative interface 
for revising the result of synset assignment. And 
Section 6 concludes our work. 
2 Synset Assignment 
A set of synonyms determines the meaning of a 
concept. Under the situation of limited resources 
on a language, English equivalent word in a bi-
lingual dictionary is a crucial key to find an 
appropriate synset for the entry word in question. 
The synset assignment criteria described in this 
Section relies on the information of English 
equivalent and synonym of a lexical entry, which 
is most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual 
dictionary. 
Synset Assignment Criteria 
Applying the nature of WordNet which introduces 
a set of synonyms to define the concept, we set up 
four criteria for assigning a synset to a lexical entry. 
The confidence score (CS) is introduced to 
annotate the likelihood of the assignment. The 
highest score, CS=4, is assigned to the synset that 
is evident to include more than one English 
equivalent of the lexical entry in question. On the 
contrary, the lowest score, CS=1, is assigned to 
any synset that occupies only one of the English 
equivalents of the lexical entry in question when 
multiple English equivalents exist. 
The details of assignment criteria are elaborated 
as in the followings. Li denotes the lexical entry, Ej 
denotes the English equivalent, Sk denotes the syn-
set, and ? denotes the member of a set: 
Case 1: Accept the synset that includes more 
than one English equivalent with confidence score 
of 4. 
Figure 1 simulates that a lexical entry L0 has two 
English equivalents of E0 and E1. Both E0 and E1 
are included in a synset of S1. The criterion implies 
that both E0 and E1 are the synset for L0 which can 
be defined by a greater set of synonyms in S1. 
Therefore the relatively high confidence score, 
CS=4, is assigned for this synset to the lexical en-
try. 
 
Figure 1. Synset assignment with SC=4 
Example: 
L0:  
E0: aim  E1: target 
S0: purpose, intent, intention, aim, design 
S1: aim, object, objective, target 
S2: aim 
In the above example, the synset, S1, is assigned 
to the lexical entry, L0, with CS=4. 
Case 2: Accept the synset that includes more 
than one English equivalent of the synonym of the 
lexical entry in question with confidence score of 3.  
In case that Case 1 fails in finding a synset that 
includes more than one English equivalent, the 
English equivalent of a synonym of the lexical en-
try is picked up to investigate.

 Figure 2. Synset assignment with SC=3 
Figure 2 simulates that an English equivalent of 
a lexical entry L0 and its synonym L1 are included 
in a synset S1. In this case the synset S1 is assigned 
to both L0 and L1 with CS=3. The score in this case 
is lower than the one assigned in Case 1 because 
the synonym of the English equivalent of the lexi-
cal entry is indirectly implied from the English 
equivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry. The 
newly retrieved English equivalent may not be dis-
torted. 
Example: 
L0: 	
  L1: 
 
E0: stare  E1: gaze 
S0: gaze, stare S1: stare 
In the above example, the synset, S0, is assigned 
to the lexical entry, L0, with CS=3. 
Case 3: Accept the only synset that includes the 
only one English equivalent with confidence score 
of 2. 
 
Figure 3. Synset assignment with SC=2 
Figure 3 simulates the assignment of CS-2 when 
there is only one English equivalent and there is no 
synonym of the lexical entry. Though there is no 
any English equivalent to increase the reliability of 
the assignment, in the same time there is no 
synonym of the lexical entry to distort the relation. 
In this case, the only one English equivalent shows 
it uniqueness in the translation that can maintain a 
degree of the confidence. 
Example: 
L0:           E0: obstetrician     
S0: obstetrician, accoucheur 
In the above example, the synset, S0, is assigned 
to the lexical entry, L0, with CS=2. 
Case 4: Accept more than one synset that in-
cludes each of the English Equivalent with confi-
dence score of 1. 
Case 4 is the most relax rule to provide some re-
lation information between the lexical entry and a 
synset. Figure 4 simulates the assignment of CS=1 
to any relations that do not meet the previous crite-
ria but the synsets that include one of the English 
equivalent of the lexical entry. 
 
Figure 4. Synset assignment with SC=1 
Example: 
L0: 
 
E0: hole  E1: canal 
S0: hole, hollow   
S1: hole, trap, cakehole, maw, yap, gop 
S2: canal, duct, epithelial duct, channel 
In the above example, each synset, S0, S1, and S2 
is assigned to lexical entry L0, with CS=1. 
3 Experiment results 
We applied the synset assignment criteria to a 
Thai-English dictionary (MMT dictionary) (CICC, 
1995) with the synset from WordNet 2.1. To com-
pare the ratio of assignment for Thai-English dic-
tionary, we also investigate the synset assignment 
of Indonesian-English and Mongolian-English dic-
tionaries.

Table 1. Synset assignment to T-E dictionary 
In our experiment, there are only 24,457 synsets 
from 207,010 synsets, which is 12% of the total 
number of the synset that can be assigned to Thai 
lexical entries. Table 1 shows the successful rate in 
assigning synset to Thai-English dictionary. About 
24 % of Thai lexical entries are found with the 
English equivalents that meet one of our criteria.  
Going through the list of unmapped lexical en-
try, we can classify the errors into three groups:-

pound, especially in case that there is no an 
appropriate translation to represent exactly 
the same sense. For example, 
L: 		 E: retail shop 
L:   E: pull sharply 
2. Phrase
Some particular words culturally used in one 
language may not be simply translated into 
one single word sense in English. In this 
case, we found it explained in a phrase. For 
example, 
L: 	
E: small pavilion for monks to sit on to 
chant 
L: 
E: bouquet worn over the ear 
3. Word form 
Inflected forms i.e. plural, past participle, 
are used to express an appropriate sense of a 
lexical entry. This can be found in non-
inflection languages such as Thai and most 
of Asian languages. For example, 
L: 	  E: grieved 
The above English expressions cause an error in 
find an appropriate synset.

Table 2. Synset assignment to I-E dictionary 
We applied the same algorithm to Indonesia-
English and Mongolian-English (Hangin, 1986) 
dictionaries to investigate how it works with other 
languages in terms of the selection of English 
equivalents. The difference in unit of concept is 
basically understood to effect the assignment of 
English equivalents in bi-lingual dictionaries. In 
Table 2, the size of Indonesian-English dictionary 
is about half of Thai-English dictionary. The suc-
cess rates of assignment to the lexical entry are the 
same but the rate of synset assignment of Indone-
sian-English dictionary is lower than one of Thai-
English dictionary. This is because the total num-
ber of lexical entry is almost in the half size.

A small set of Mongolian-English dictionary is 
also evaluated. Table 3 shows the result of synset 
assignment. 
These experiments show the effectiveness of us-
ing English equivalents and synonyms information 
from limited resources in assigning WordNet syn-
sets. 
4 Evaluations 
In the evaluation of our approach for synset as-
signment, we randomly selected 1,044 synsets 
from the result of synset assignment to Thai-
English dictionary (MMT dictionary) for manually 
checking. The random set covers all types of part-
of-speech and degrees of confidence score (CS) to 
confirm the approach in all possible situations. Ac-
cording to the supposition of our algorithm that the 
set of English equivalents of a word entry and its 
synonyms are significant information to relate to a 
synset of WordNet, the result of accuracy will be 
correspondent to the degree of CS. The detail num-
ber of synsets to be used in the evaluation is shown 
in Table 4.

Table 5 shows the accuracy of synset assign-
ment by part-of-speech and CS. A small set of ad-
verb synsets are 100% correctly assigned irrelevant 
to its CS. The total number of adverbs for the 
evaluation could be too small. The algorithm 
shows a better result of 48.7% in average for noun

synset assignment and 43.2% in average for all 
part-of-speech.

Table 5. Accuracy of synset assignment 
With the better information of English equiva-
lents marked with CS=4, the assignment accuracy 
is as high as 80.0% and decreases accordingly due 
to the CS value. This confirms that the accuracy of 
synset assignment strongly relies on the number of 
English equivalents in the synset. The indirect in-
formation of English equivalents of the synonym 
of the word entry is also helpful. It yields 60.7% of 
accuracy in synset assignment for the group of 
CS=3. Others are quite low but the English equiva-
lents are somehow useful to provide the candidates 
for expert revision.

Table 6. Additional correct synset assignment by

To examine the effectiveness of English equiva-
lent and synonym information from different 
source, we consulted another Thai-English diction-
ary (LEXiTRON). Table 6 shows the improvement 
of the assignment by the increased number of cor-
rect assignment in each type. We can correct more 
in noun and verb but not adjective. Verb and adjec-
tive are ambiguously defined in Thai lexicon, and 
the number of the remained adjective is too few, 
therefore, the result should be improved uncon-
cerned with the type.

Table 7. Improved correct synset assignment by

Table 7 shows the total improvement of the as-
signment accuracy when we integrated English 
equivalent and synonym information from differ-
ent source. The accuracy for synsets marked with 
CS=4 is improved from 80.0% to 93.3% and the 
average accuracy is also significantly improved 
from 43.2% to 49.4%. All types of synset are sig-
nificantly improved only if a bi-lingual dictionary 
from different sources is available. 
5 Collaborative Work on Asian WordNet 
There are some efforts in developing WordNets of 
some Asian languages, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Ko-
rean (Choi, 2003), (Choi et al, 2004), (Kaji et al, 
2006), (KorLex, 2006), (Huang, 2007) and Hindi 
(Hindi Wordnet, 2007). The number of languages 
that have been successfully developed their Word-
Nets is still limited to some active research in this 
area. However, the extensive development of 
WordNet in other languages is important, not only 
to help in implementing NLP applications in each 
language, but also in inter-linking WordNets of 
different languages to develop multi-lingual appli-
cations to overcome the language barrier.   
We adopt the proposed criteria for automatic 
synset assignment for Asian languages which has 
limited language resources. Based on the result 
from the above synset assignment algorithm, we 
provide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initiator) 
(Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlamvanich et 
al., 2007) to establish an online collaborative work 
in refining the WorNets. 
KUI is a community software which allows reg-
istered members including language experts revise 
and vote for the synset assignment. The system 
manages the synset assignment according to the 
preferred score obtained from the revision process.  
As a result, the community WordNets will be ac-
complished and exported into the original form of 
WordNet database. Via the synset ID assigned in 
the WordNet, the system can generate a cross lan-
guage WordNet result. Through this effort, an ini-
tial version of Asian WordNet can be fulfilled. 
Figure 5 illustrates the translation page of KUI1. 
In the working area, the login member can partici-
pate in proposing a new translation or vote for the 
preferred translation to revise the synset assign-
ment. Statistics of the progress as well as many 
useful functions such as item search, record jump, 
chat, list of online participants are also provided.

6 Conclusion 
Our synset assignment criteria were effectively 
applied to languages having only English equiva-
lents and its lexical synonym. Confidence score 
was proved efficiently assigned to determine the 
degree of reliability of the assignment which later 
was a key value in the revision process. Languages 
in Asia are significantly different from the English 
language in terms of grammar and lexical word 
unit. The differences prevent us from finding the 
target synset by following just the English equiva-
lent. Synonyms of the lexical entry and additional 
dictionary from different sources can be compli-
mentarily used to improve the accuracy in the as-
signment. Applying the same criteria to other 
Asian languages also yielded a satisfactory result. 
Following the same process that we had imple-
mented to the Thai language, we are expecting an 
acceptable result from the Indonesian, Mongolian 
languages and so on. After the revision at KUI, the 
initial stage of Asian WordNet will be referable 
through the assigned synset ID.
