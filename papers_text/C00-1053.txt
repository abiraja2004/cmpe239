Abstract 
In order to realize their full potential, multimodal 
interfaces need to support not just input from 
multiple modes, but single comnmnds optinmlly 
distributed across the available input modes. A 
multimodal anguage processing architecture is 
needed to integrate semantic content from the 
different modes. Johnston 1998a proposes a 
modular approach to multimodal language 
processing in which spoken language parsing is 
completed before lnultimodal parsing. In this 
paper, I will demonstrate the difficulties this 
approach faces as the spoken language parsing 
component is expanded to provide a compositional 
analysis of deictic expressions. I propose an 
alternative architecture in which spoken and 
multimodal parsing are tightly interleaved. This 
architecture greatly simplifies the spoken language 
parsing grm-nmar and enables predictive 
information fiom spoken language parsing to drive 
the application of multimodal parsing and gesture 
combination rules. I also propose a treatment of 
deictic numeral expressions that supports the 
broad range of pen gesture combinations that can 
be used to refer to collections of objects in the 
interface. 
Introduction 
Multimodal interfaces allow content to be 
conveyed between humans and machines over 
multiple different channels uch speech, graphics, 
pen, and hand gesture. This enables more natural 
and efficient interaction since different kinds of 
content are best suited to particular modes. For 
example, spatial information is effectively 
conveyed using gesture for input (Oviatt 1997) and 
2d or 3d graphics for output (Towns et al1998). 
Multimodal interfaces also stand to play a critical 
role in the ongoing migration of interaction onto 
wireless portable computing devices, such as 
PDAs and next generation phones, which have 
limited screen real estate and no keyboard. For 
such devices, complex graphical user interfaces 
are not feasible and speech and pen will be the 
primary input lnodes. I focus here on multimodal 
interfaces which support speech and pen input. 
Pen input consists of gestures and drawings which 
are made in electronic ink on the computer display 
and processed by a gesture recognizer. Speech 
input is transcribed using a speech recognizer. 
This paper is concerned with the 
relationship between spoken language parsing and 
nmltimodal parsing, specifically whether they 
should be separate modular components, and the 
related issue of determining the appropriate l vel 
of constituent structure at which nmltimodal 
integration should apply. Johnston 1998a 
proposes a modular approach in which the 
individual modes are parsed and assigned typed 
feature structures representing their combinatory 
properties and semantic content. A 
nmltidimensional chart parser then combines these 
structures in accordance with a unification-based 
lnultimodal grammar. This approach is outlined in 
Section 1. Section 2 addresses the compositional 
analysis of deictic expressions and their interaction 
with conjunction and other aspects of the 
gramnmr. In Section 3, a new architecture is
presented in which spoken and multimodal parsing 
are interleaved. Section 4 presents an analysis of 
deictic numeral expressions, and Section 5 
discusses certain constructions in which 
multimodal integration applies at higher levels of 
constituent structure than a simple deictic noun 
phrase. I will draw examples from a nmltimodal 
directory and messaging application, specifically a
multimodal variant of VPQ (Buntschuh et al
1998). 
1 Unification-based nmltimodal parsing 
Johnston 1998a presents an approach to language 
processing for multimodal systems in which 
multimodal integration strategies are specified 
declaratively in a unification-based grammar 
formalism. The basic architecture of the approach 
is given in Figure I. The results of speech 
recognition and gesture recognition are interpreted 
by spoken language processing (SLP) and gesture 
processing (GP) components respectively. These 
assign typed feature structure representations 
362 
(Carpenter 1992) to speech and gesture and pass 
those on to a nmltimodal parsing component (MP). 
Tim typed feature structure formalism is 
augmented with ftmctioual constraints (Wittenbnrg 
1993). MP uses a multidimensional chart parser to 
combine the interpretations of speech and gesture 
in accordance with a nmltimodal unil'ication-based 
grammar, determines the range of possible 
lnultimodal interpretations, selects the one with the 
highest joint probability, and passes it on for 
execution. 
~ Commands 
Figure 1 Modular architecture (Johnston 1998a) 
As an example of a multimodal command, in order 
to reposition an object, a user might say 'move this 
here' and make two gestures on the display. The 
spoken command 'move this here' needs to 
combine with the two gestures, the first indicating 
the entity to be moved and the second indicating 
where it should be moved to. In cases where the 
spoken string needs to combine with more than 
one gesture, it is assigned a multimodal 
subcategorization list indicating the gestures it 
needs, how they contribute to the meaning, and the 
constraints on their combination. For e.xample, 
SLI' assigns 'move this here' the feature structure 
in Figure 2. 
The mmsubcat: list indicates that this 
input needs to combine with two gestures. The 
spoken command is constrained to overlap with or 
follow within five seconds of the first gesture. 
The second gesture must follow within five 
seconds of the first. The first provides the entity to 
move and second the new location. GP assigns 
incolning estures feature structure representations 
specifying their semantic type and any object they 
select and passes these on to MP. MP uses general 
combinatory schelnata for nmltimodal 
subcategorization (Jolmston 1998a, p. 628) to 
combine the gestures with the speech, saturate the 
nmltilnodal subcategorization list, and yield an 
executable command.

Tiffs approach as many advantages. It allows for 
a great degree of expressivity. Combinations of 
speech with multiple gestures can be described as 
can visual parsing of collections of gestures. 
Unlike many previous multilaodal systems, the 
approach is not speech-driven, any piece of 
content can come fiom any mode. Another 
significant advantage is the lnoclularity of spoken 
hmguage parsing (SLP) and multimodal parsing 
(MP). More general rules regal'ding multimodal 
integration are in MP while the specific speech 
graMlllar used for an application is in SLP, 
enabling reuse of the multimodal parsing module 
for different applications. This modularity also 
enables plug-and-play of different kinds of spoken 
language parsers with the same multimodal 
parsing component. SLP can be a traditional chart 
parser, a robust parser, or a stochastic parser 
(Gorin et al1997). The modularity of SLP and 
MP also facilitates the adoption of a different 
strategy for string parsing t?om that used for 
multimodal parsing. Traditional approaches to 
string parsing, such as chart parsing (Kay 1980) 
assume the combining constituents o be discrete 
and in linear order. This imposes significant 
constraints on the combination of elelnents, greatly 
reduces the number of Colabinations that need to 
be considered, and facilitates prediction in parsing. 
In contrast, multimodal input is distributed over 
two or three spatial dimensions, peech, and time. 
Unlike words in a string, speech and gesture may 
overlap temporally and there is no singular 
dimension on which tim input is linear and 
discrete. The constraints that drive parsing are 
363 
specific to the combining elements and there is not 
the same general means for predictive parsing 
(Johnston 1998a). 
While the modularity of spoken language 
processing and multimodal parsing in Johnston 
1998a has many advantages, the assumption that 
all processing of the spoken string takes place 
before multimodal integration leads to significant 
difficulties as the spoken language processing 
component is expanded to handle more complex 
language and to provide a compositional nalysis 
of spoken language containing deictics. 
2 Composit ional  analysis of  de ic t i cs  
The basic problem the approach faces is to provide 
an analysis of spoken language in multimodal 
systems which enables the appropriate multilnodal 
subcategorization frame and associated constraints 
to be built compositionally in the course of parsing 
the spoken string. Whatever the syntactic 
structure of the spoken utterance, the essential 
constraint on the multimodal subcategorization is 
that the list of subcategorized gestures match the 
linear order of the deictic expressions in the 
utterance, and that the temporal constraints also 
reflect hat order. This can be thought of in terms 
of lambda abstraction. What we need to do is 
abstract over all of the unbound variables in the 
predicate that will be instantiated by gesture. For 
an expression like 'move tiffs here' we generate 
the abstraction. 2ge,,tio.2gh,catio,,.nlove(ge,,tio.,glocatio,,). 
In terms of the analysis above, this amounts to 
deriving the feature structure in Figure 2 
compositionally fi'om feature structures assigned 
to 'move', 'this', and 'here'. 
One way to accomplish this within the 
modular approach is to set up the spoken language 
processing component so that it manipulates two 
subcat lists: a regular spoken language subcat: list 
and a multimodal mmsubcat: list. Information 
about needed gestures percolates through the 
syntactic parse. The verb 'move' is assigned tim 
feature structure in Figure 3. It subcategorizes (in
the string) for an entity and for a location. If the 
arguments are not deictic, for example 'move the 
supplies to the island' the verb simply combines 
with its arguments to yield a complete command. 
Deictic expressions are assigned structures which 
subcategorize for phrases which subcategorize for 
NPs (the deictic expression is essentially type 
raised). The structure for 'this' is given in Figure 
4. Tim structure for 'here' is like that for 'this', 
except hat it selects for a verb subcategorizing for 
a location rather than an entity (subeat:f irst:  
subeat:first:eontent:type is location).

Figure 4 Feature structure for 'this' 
In 'move this here', 'this' combines with the verb 
to its left, removing the first specification on the 
subcat:  list of 'move' and adding a gesture 
specification to the resulting mmsubcat:. Then 
'here' composes to the left with 'move this' 
relnoving the next specification on the subeat: and 
adding another gesture specification to the 
mmsubcat: I. The constraint on the first gesture

differs from that on the others. The t'irst must 
overlap o1 precede the speech, while tile others 
lnust follow the preceding gesture. This is 
achieved with the feature deictie: which is set to 
yes when composition with the first deictic takes 
place. The setting of this t'eature determines which 
of the temporal constraints applies (using 
conditional constraints). The lasttime: feature 
always provides the time of the last entity in the 
sequence o1' inputs. The mmsubcat:end: feature 
provides access to the end of the current 
mmsubcat: list. Once the subcat: feature has 
value end the mmsubcat:end: needs to be set to 
end and then the value of nunsubcat:list: is the 
same as lhe msubcat: in Figure 2 and can be 
passed on to the multimodal parser. 
So then, it is possible to set up tile speech 
parsing granlular so that it will build tile needed 
subcategorization for gestures and modularity 
between specch parsing and multimodal parsing 
can be maintained. However, as more complex 
phenomena re considered tile resulting gramlnar 
becomes more and more complex. In tile example 
above, the deictic NPs are pronouns ('lhis', 
'here'). The grammar of noun phrases needs to be 
set up so that tile presence of a deictic determiner 
makes the whole phrase subcategorize for a verb 
as in 'move this large green one here'. Matters 
becolne lnore complex as tile grammar is 
expanded to handle conjunction, for example 
'move this and this he,w'. An analysis of nolninal 
col\junction can be set up in which the multimodal 
subcategorization lists of conjuncts are combined 
and assigned constraints uch that gestures are 
required in the order in which the dcictic words (or 
other phrases requiring gestures) appear. If a 
deictic appears within a conjoined phrase, that 
phrase is assigned a representation which 
subcategorizes for a verb (just as 'this' does 
above). In 'move this and this there', 'this and 
this' combines with 'move' then 'there' combines 
with the result, yielding an expression which 
subcategorizes for three gestures. The treatment 
of possessives also needs to be expanded to handle 
deictics. For example, in 'call this pelwon's 
mmtber', 'this l)etwon 's number' needs to 
subcategorize for a verb which subcategorizes fox 
a nmnber while the multimodal subcategorization 
is for a gesture on a person. The possibility of 
larger phrases mapping onto single gestures 
further complicates matters. For example, to allow 
lk~r 'move.fi'om here to there' with a line gesture 
which connects tile start and elld points, SLP will 
need to assign multimodal subcategorization list 
with a single line element to the whole phrase 
'from here to there', in addition to the other 
analysis in which this expression multimodally 
subcategorizes for two gestures. An alternative is 
to have a rule that breaks down any line into its 
start and end points. The problem then is that you 
introduce subpart points into the muitimodal chart 
that could combine with other speech recognition 
results and lead to selection of the wrong parse of 
the multimodal input. Keeping the points together 
as a line avoids this difficulty but complicates tile 
SLP grammar. I return to these cases of larger 
phrases subcategorizing for single gestures in 
Section 5 below. 
If tile separation of natural language 
parsing and multimodal integration is to be 
maintained, the analysis of deictics 1 have shown, 
or one like it, has to permeate the whole of the 
natural language grammar so that appropriate 
nmltimodal subcategorization frames can be built 
in a general way. This can be done, but as the 
coverage of the natural anguage grammar grows, 
the analysis becomes increasingly baroque and 
hard to maintain. To overcome these difficulties, I 
propose here a new architecture in which spoken 
language parsing and multimodal parsing are 
interleaved and multilnodal integration takes place 
at the constituent structure level of simple deictic 
NPs. 
3 Interleaviug spoken language parsing 
and multimodal parsing 
There are a nmnber of different ways in which 
spoken language parsing (SLP) and multimodal 
parsing (MP) can be imerleaved: (1) SLP 
populates a chart with fragments, these are passed 
to MP which determines possible combinations 
with gesture, the resulting combinations are passed 
back to SLP which continues until a parse of the 
string is found, (2) SLP parses the incoming string 
into a series of fragments, these become edges in 
MP and are combined with gestures, MP is 
augmented with rules from SLP which operate in 
MP in order to complete the analysis of the phrase, 
(3) SLP and MP are merged and there is one single 
gralnmar covering both spoken language and 
multimodal parsing (cf. Johnston and Bangalore 
2000). 1 adopt here strategy (1) represented in 
Figure 5. 
365 
Commands 
Figure 5 Interleaved architecture 
A significant advantage of (1) is that it limits the 
number of elements and combinations that need to 
considered by the nmltimodal parser. The 
complexity of the inultidilnensional parsing 
algorithm is exponential in the worst case 
(Johnston 1998a) and so it is important to limit the 
number of elements that need to be considered. 
Another advantage of (1) over (2) and (3) is that as 
in the modular approach, the grammars are 
separated, facilitating reuse of the multimodal 
component for applications with different spoken 
COlnmands. Also, (2) has the problem that there is 
redundancy among the SLP and MP grammars, 
both need to have the grammars of verb 
subcategorization, conjunction etc. 
Returning now to the example above, 
'move this here'. The representation f 'move' is 
as before in Figure 3, except there is no 
mmsubcat: feature. The difference lies in the 
representation f the deictic expressions. In the 
first pass of SLP, the deictic NP 'this' is assigned 
the representation in Figure 6 (a). I have used < > 
to represent the list-wdued mmsubcat: feature and 
the constraints: feature is given in { }. The 
location deictic 'here' is assigned a similar 
representation except hat its content:type: feature 
has value location. All deictic expressions (those 
with deictic: yes) are passed to MP. MP uses a 
general subcategorization schema to combine 
'this' with an appropriate gesture, yielding the 
representation i  Figure 6 (b). The multimodal 
subcategorization schema changes the eat: featum 
from deictic_np to np when the mmsubcat: is 
saturated. Much the same happens for 'here' and 
both edges are passed back to SLP and added into 
the chart (the chart: feature keeps track of their 
location in the chart). Now that the deictic NPs 
have been combined with gestures and converted 
to NPs, spoken language parsing can proceed and 
'move' combines with 'this' and 'here' to yield an 
executable command which is then passed on to 
MP, which selects the optimal multimodal 
command and passes it on for execution. In 
examples with conjunction such as 'move this and 
this here', the deictic NPs am combined with 
gestures by MP belbre conjunction takes place in 
SLP, and so there is no need to complicate the 
analysis of conjunction.

In this approach, the level of constituent structure 
at which multilnodal integration applies is the 
simple deictic NP. It is preferable to integrate at 
this level rather than the level of the deictic 
determiner, since other words in the simple NP 
will place constraints on the choice and 
interpretation of the gesture. For example, 'this 
petwon' is constrained to integrate with a gesture at 
a person while 'this number' is constrained to 
integrate with a gesture at a number. 
4 Deictic numerical expressions 
I turn now to the analysis of deictic expressions 
with numerals. An example command fi'om the 
multimodal messaging application domain is 
'email these four people'. This could be handled 
by developing an analysis that assigns 'these four 
people' a multimodal subcategorization which 
selects for four spatial gestures at people: <Gpe,..,.o,,, 
Gm,..,.o,,. Gp,.,,,.o,,. Gp ........ ,>. Similarly, 'these two 
organizations' would have tile following 
multimodal subcategorization: <Go,.~,,,,iz,tio,,, 
Go,.~,,,,iz,,~o,,>. The multilnodal subcategorization 
fiame will be saturated in MP through 
combination with the appropriate number of 
individual selection gestums. The problem with 
this approach is that it does not account for the 
wide range of different gesture patterns that can be 
366 
used to refer to a set of N objects on a disphty. 
Single objects may be selected using pointing 
gestures or circling (or underlining). Circling 
gestures can also be used to refer to sets of objects 
and combinations of circling and pointing can be 
used to enumerate a set of entities. Figure 7 shows 
some of the different ways that a set of four 
objects can be refened to using electronic ink. 
The graphical layout of objects on the 
screen plays an ilnportant role in deterlnining the 
kind of gesture combinations that are likely. If 
three objects are close together and another further 
away, the least effortl'ul gesture combination is to 
circle the three and then circle oi point at the 
remaining one. If all four are close together, then 
it is easiest to make a single area gesture 
containing all four. If other objects intervene 
between the objects to be selected, individual 
selections are lnore likely since there is less risk of 
accidentally selecting the intervening objects. It is 
desirable that multimodal systems be able to 
handle the broad range of ways to select 
collections of entities so that users can utilize the 
and most natural gesture least effortful 
combination.

Figure 7 Gestures at collections of entities 
The range of possible,gesture combinations can be 
captured using multimodal subcategorization as 
above, but this vastly complicates the SLP 
grammar and leads to an explosion of ambiguity. 
Every time a numerical expression appears a 
multitude of alternative multimodal 
subcategorization fralnes would need to be 
assigned to it. 
To address this problem, my approach is to 
underspecify the particular configuration of 
gestures in the multilnodal subcategorization o1' 
the deictic uumeral expression. Instead of 
subcategorizing for a sequence of N gestures, 
'these N' subcategorizes for a collection of 
plurality N : <G\[number:N\]>. The expression 
'these fi~ttr people' has subcategorization 
<Gw.~.o,,\[mm,ber:4\]>. An independent set of roles 
for gesture combination are used to enumerate all 
of the different ways to refer to a collection of 
entities. In simplil'ied form, the basic gesture 
combination rule is as in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Gesture combination rule 
The rule is also constrained so that the combining 
gestures are adjacent in time and do not intersect 
with each other. The gesture combination rules 
will enumerate a broad range of possible gesture 
collections (though not as many combiuations as 
when they are enumerated in the mullimodal 
subcategorization frame). The over-application of
these rules can be prevented by using predictive 
information from SLP; that is, if SLP parses 'these 
.four people' then these rules are applied to the 
gesture input in order to construct candidate 
collections of four people. 
5 Integrat ion at higher levels of  const i tuent 
structure 
In the analysis developed above, multimodal 
inlegration takes place at the level of simple 
deictic nominal expressions. There are however 
nmltimodal utterances where a single gesture maps 
onto a higher level of constituent structure in the 
spoken language parse. For example, 'move from 
here to there' could appear with two pointing 
gestures, but could also very well appear with a 
line gesture indicating the start and end of the 
move. In this case, the integration coukt be kept at 
the level of 'here' and 'there' by introducing a rule 
which splits line gestures into their component 
start and end points (Gli,,e ---) Gi,oim Gl,,,i,,t). The 
problem with this approach is that it introduces 
points that MP could then attempt to combine with 
other recognition results leading to an erroneous 
parse of the utterance. To avoid this problem the 
SLP grammar can assign two possible analyses to 
this string. In one, both 'here' aud 'there' are 
passed to MP for integration with point gestures. 
In the other, 'fi'om here to there' is parsed in SLP 
367 
and passed to MP for integration with a line 
gesture. There are related examples with 
conjunction 'move this organization and this 
department here'. An encircling esture could be 
used to identify 'this organization and this 
department' (especially if the pen is close to each 
object as the corresponding deictic phrase is 
uttered). However, if in the general case we allow 
SLP to generate multiple analyzes of a 
conjunction, there will be an explosion of possible 
patterns generated, just as in the case of deictic 
numeral expressions. To overcome this difficulty, 
gesture decomposition rules can be used. In order 
to avoid errorful combinations with other 
recognition results, the application of these rules in 
MP needs to be driven by predictive information 
from SLP; that is, in our example, if single 
gestures cannot be found to combine with 'this 
organization' and 'this department', then the 
gesture decomposition rules are applied to 
temporally appropriate multiple selection gestures 
to extract the needed individual selections. A 
similar approach could be used to handle 'fi'om 
here to there' with a controlled GI,-,,. --~ @,o~,,t Gpoi, t
rule which only applies when required. 
Conclusion 
I have proposed an approach to nmltimodal 
language processing in which spoken language 
parsing and nmltimodal parsing are more tightly 
coupled than in the modular pipeliued approach 
taken in Johnston 1998. The spoken language 
parsing component and nmltilnodal parsing 
component cooperate in determining the 
interpretation of nmltimodal utterances. This 
enables multimodal integration to occur at a level 
of constituent s ructure below the verbal utterance 
level specifically, the simple deictic noun phrase. 
This greatly simplifies the development of the 
spoken language parsing grammar as it is no 
longer necessary construct a single multimodal 
subcategorization list for the whole utterance. 
Following the modular approach of Johnston 
! 998a, the treatment of multimodal 
subcategorization permeates the whole gramlnar 
complicating the analysis of verb 
subcategorization, conjunction, possessives and 
inany other phenomena. This new approach also 
enables more detailed inodeling of temporal 
constraints in multi-gesture multimodal utterances. 
I have also argued that a deictic numeral 
expression should multimodally subcategorize for 
a collection of entities and should be 
underspecified with respect to the particular 
combination of gestures used to pick out the 
collection. Possible combination patterns are 
enumerated by gesture composition rules. 
Communication between SLP and MP enables 
predictive application of rules for gesture 
composition and decomposition which might 
otherwise over-apply.
