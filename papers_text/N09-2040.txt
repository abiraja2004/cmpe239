Abstract 
Answer Validation is a topic of significant in-
terest within the Question Answering commu-
nity.  In this paper, we propose the use of 
language modeling methodologies for Answer 
Validation, using corpus-based methods that do 
not require the use of external sources.  Specifi-
cally, we propose a model for Answer Credibil-
ity which quantifies the reliability of a source 
document that contains a candidate answer and 
the Question?s Context Model. 
1 Introduction 
In recent years, Answer Validation has become a 
topic of significant interest within the Question 
Answering community.  In the general case, one 
can describe Answer Validation as the process that 
decides whether a Question is correctly answered 
by an Answer according to a given segment of sup-
porting Text. Magnini et al (Magnini, 2002) pre-
sents an approach to Answer Validation that uses 
redundant information sources on the Web; they 
propose that the number of Web documents in 
which the question and the answer co-occurred can 
serve as an indicator of answer validity.  Other re-
cent approaches to Answer Validation Exercise in 
the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 
(Peters, 2008) make use of textual entailment 
methodologies for the purposes of Answer Valida-
tion.  
 
In this paper, we propose the use of language mod-
eling methodologies for Answer Validation, using 
corpus-based methods that do not require the use 
of external sources.  Specifically, we propose the 
development of an Answer Credibility score which 
quantifies reliability of a source document that 
contains a candidate answer with respect to the 
Question?s Context Model.  Unlike many textual 
entailment methods, our methodology has the ad-
vantage of being applicable to question types for 
which hypothesis generation is not easily accom-
plished. 
 
The remainder of this paper describes our work in 
progress, including our model for Answer Credi-
bility, our experiments and results to date, and fu-
ture work. 
2 Answer Credibility 
Credibility has been extensively studied in the field 
of information science (Metzger, 2002).  Credibil-
ity in the computational sciences has been charac-
terized as being synonymous with believability, 
and has been broken down into the dimensions of 
trustworthiness and expertise.   
 
Our mathematical model of Answer Credibility 
attempts to quantify the reliability of a source us-
ing the semantic Question Context.  The semantic 
Question Context is built using the Aspect-Based 
Relevance Language Model that was presented in 
(Banerjee, 2008) and (Banerjee, 2009). This model 
builds upon the Relevance Based Language Model 
(Lavrenko, 2001) and Probabilisitic Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) to provide a 
mechanism for relating sense disambiguated Con-
cept Terms (CT) to a query by their likelihood of 
relevance. 
 
The Aspect-Based Relevance Language Model 
assumes that for every question there exists an un-
157
derlying relevance model R, which is assigned 
probabilities P(z|R) where z is a latent aspect of the 
information need, as defined by PLSA.  Thus, we 
can obtain a distribution of aspects according to 
their likelihood of relevancy to the user?s informa-
tion need.  By considering terms from the aspects 
that have the highest likelihood of relevance (eg. 
highest P(z|R) values), we can build a distribution 
that models a semantic Question Context. 
 
We define Answer Credibility to be a similarity 
measure between the Question Context (QC) and 
the source document from which the answer was 
derived.  We consider the Question Context to be a 
document, which has a corresponding document 
language model.  We then use the well-known 
Kullback-Leibler divergence method (Lafferty, 
2001) to compute the similarity between the Ques-
tion Context document model and the document 
model for a document containing a candidate an-
swer: 
Here, P(w|QC) is the language model of the Ques-
tion Context, P(w|d) is the language model o the 
document containing the candidate answer.  To 
insert this model into the Answer Validation proc-
ess, we propose an interpolation technique that 
modulates the answer score during the process us-
ing Answer Credibility. 
3 Experimental Setup 
The experimental methodology we used is shown 
as a block diagram in Figure 1. To validate our 
approach, we used the set of all factoid questions 
from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) 2006 
Question Answering Track (Voorhees, 2006).  
 
The OpenEphyra Question Answering testbed 
(Schlaefer, 2006) was then used as the framework 
for our Answer Credibility implementation.  
OpenEphyra uses a baseline Answer Validation 
mechanism which uses documents retrieved using 
Yahoo! search to support candidate answers found 
in retrieved passages.  In our experiments, we con-
structed the Question Context according to the 
methodology described in (Banerjee, 2008).  Our 
experiments used the Lemur Language Modeling 
toolkit (Strohman, 2005) and the Indri search en-
gine (Ogilvie, 2001) to construct the Question 
Context and document language models. 
Figure 1:  Experiment Methodology 
 
We then inserted an Answer Credibility filter into 
the OpenEphyra processing pipeline which modu-
lates the OpenEphyra answer score according to 
the following formula: 
Here score is the original OpenEphyra answer 
score and score' is the modulated answer score.  In 
this model, ? is an interpolation constant which we 
set using the average of the P(z|R) values for those 
aspects that are included in the Question Context. 
 
For the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of 
our theoretical model, we use the accuracy and 
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics (Voorhees, 
2005).    
4 Results 
We compare the results of the baseline 
OpenEphyra Answer Validation approach against 
the results after our Answer Credibility processing 
has been included as a part of the OpenEphyra 
pipeline.  Our results are presented in Table 1 and 
Table 2. 
 
To facilitate interpretation of our results, we sub-
divided the set of factoid questions into categories 
by their question words, following the example of 
(Murdock, 2006).  The light grey shaded cells in 
both tables indicate categories for which improve-
ments were observed after our Answer Credibility 
model was applied.  The dark grey shaded cells in 
both tables indicate categories for which no change 
was observed.  The paired Wilcoxon signed rank

test was used to measure significance in improve-
ments for MRR; the shaded cells in Table 2 indi-
cate results for which the results were significant 
(p<0.05).  Due to the binary results for accuracy at 
the question level (eg. a question is either correct 
or incorrect), the Wilcoxon test was found to be 
inappropriate for measuring statistical significance 
in accuracy.

Answer Credibility 
 
Table 2:  Average Accuracy of Baseline vs. Baseline In-
cluding Answer Credibility 
 
Our results show the following: 
? A 5% improvement in accuracy over the base-
line for ?what?-type questions. 
? An overall improvement of 13% in accuracy 
for ?who?-type questions, which include the 
?who,? ?who is? and ?who was? categories  
? A 9% improvements in MRR for ?what? type 
questions 
? An overall improvement of 25% in MRR for 
?who?-type questions, which include the 
?who,? ?who is? and ?who was? categories 
? Overall, 7 out of 13 categories (58%) per-
formed at the same level or better than the 
baseline 
5 Discussion 
In this section, we examine some examples of 
questions that showed improvement to better un-
derstand and interpret our results. 
 
First, we examine a ?who? type question which 
was not correctly answered by the baseline system, 
but which was correctly answered after including 
Answer Credibility.  For the question ?Who is the 
host of the Daily Show?? the baseline system cor-
rectly determined the answer was ?Jon Stewart? 
but incorrectly identified the document that this 
answer was derived from.  For this question, the 
Question Context included the terms ?stewart,? 
?comedy,? ?television,? ?news,? and ?kilborn.?  
(Craig Kilborn was the host of Daily Show until 
1999, which makes his name a logical candidate 
for inclusion in the Question Context since the 
AQUAINT corpus spans 1996-2000).  In this case, 
the correct document that the answer was derived 
from was actually ranked third in the list.  The An-
swer Credibility filter was able to correctly in-
crease the answer score of that document so that it 
was ranked as the most reliable source for the an-
swer and chosen as the correct final result. 
 
Next, we consider a case where the correct answer 
was ranked at a lower position in the answer list in 
the baseline results and correctly raised higher, 
though not to the top rank, after the application of  
our Answer Credibility filter.  For the question 
?What position did Janet Reno assume in 1993?? 
the correct answer (?attorney general?) was ranked 
5 in the list in the baseline results.  However, in 
this case the score associated with the answer was 
lower than the top-ranked answer by an order of 
magnitude.  The Question Context for this question 
included the terms ?miami,? ?elian,? ?gonzales,? 
?boy,? ?attorney? and ?justice.?  After the applica-
tion of our Answer Credibility filter, the score and 
rank of the correct answer did increase (which con-

tributed to an increase in MRR), but the increase 
was not enough to overshoot the original top-
ranked answer. 
 
Categories for which the Answer Credibility had 
negative effect included ?how much? and ?how 
many? questions.  For these question types, the 
correct answer or correct document was frequently 
not present in the answer list.  In this case, the An-
swer Credibility filter had no opportunity to in-
crease the rank of correct answers or correct 
documents in the answer list.  This same reasoning 
also limits our applicability to questions that re-
quire a date in response. 
 
Finally, it is important to note here that the very 
nature of news data makes our methodology appli-
cable to some categories of questions more than 
others.  Since our methodology relies on the ability 
to derive semantic relationships via a statistical 
examination of text, it performs best on those ques-
tions for which some amount of supporting infor-
mation is available. 
6   Conclusions and Future Work 
In conclusion, we have presented a work in pro-
gress that uses statistical language modeling meth-
ods to create a novel measure called Answer 
Credibility for the purpose of Answer Validation.  
Our results show performance increases in both 
accuracy and MRR for ?what? and ?who? type 
questions when Answer Credibility is included as a 
part of the Answer Validation process.  Our goals 
for the future include further development of the 
Answer Credibility model to include not only 
terms from a Question Context, but terms that can 
be deduced to be in an Answer Context.
