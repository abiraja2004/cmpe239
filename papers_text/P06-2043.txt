Abstract 
Automatically acquired lexicons with 
subcategorization information have al-
ready proved accurate and useful enough 
for some purposes but their accuracy still 
shows room for improvement. By means 
of diathesis alternation, this paper pro-
poses a new filtering method, which im-
proved the performance of Korhonen?s 
acquisition system remarkably, with the 
precision increased to 91.18% and recall 
unchanged, making the acquired lexicon 
much more practical for further manual 
proofreading and other NLP uses. 
1 Introduction 
Subcategorization is the process that further clas-
sifies a syntactic category into its subsets. Chom-
sky (1965) defines the function of strict subcate-
gorization features as appointing a set of con-
straints that dominate the selection of verbs and 
other arguments in deep structure. Large sub-
categorized verbal lexicons have proved to be 
crucially important for many tasks of natural 
language processing, such as probabilistic pars-
ers (Korhonen, 2001, 2002) and verb classifica-
tions (Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen, 2003).  
Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of re-
search focusing on large-scaled automatic acqui-
sition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met 
with some success not only in English but also in 
many other languages, including German 
(Schulte im Walde, 2002), Spanish (Chrupala, 
2003), Czech (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000), Portu-
guese (Gamallo et. al, 2002), and Chinese (Han 
et al 2004). The general objective of this re-
search is to acquire from a given corpus the SCF 
types and numbers for predicate verbs. Two typi-
cal steps during the process of automatic acquisi-
tion are hypothesis generation and selection. 
Usually based on heuristic rules, the first step 
generates SCF hypotheses for involved verbs; 
and the second selects reliable ones via statistical 
methods, such as BHT (binomial hypothesis test-
ing), LLR (log likelihood ratio) and MLE 
(maximum likelihood estimation). This second 
step is also called statistical filtering and has 
been widely regarded as problematic. English 
researchers have proposed some methods adjust-
ing the corpus hypothesis frequencies before or 
while filtering. These methods are often called 
backoff techniques for SCF acquisition. Some of 
them represent a remarkable improvement in the 
acquisition performance, for example diathesis 
alternation and semantic motivation (Korhonen, 
1998, 2001, 2002). 
For the convenience of comparison between 
performances of different SCF acquisition meth-
ods, we define absolute and relative recall in this 
paper. By absolute recall, we mean the figure 
computed against the background of input corpus, 
while relative recall is against the set of gener-
ated hypotheses.  
At present, automatically acquired verb lexi-
cons with SCF information have already proved 
accurate and useful enough for some NLP pur-
poses (Korhonen, 2001; Han et al 2004). As for 
English, Korhonen (2002) reported that semanti-
cally motivated SCF acquisition achieved a pre-
cision of 87.1%, an absolute recall of 71.2% and 
a relative recall of 85.27%, thus making the ac-
quired lexicon much more accurate and useful. 
However, the accuracy still shows room for im-
provement, especially for those SCF hypotheses 
with low frequencies. Detailed analysis on the 
acquisition system and some resulting data 
shows that three main causes should account for 
the comparatively unsatisfactory performance: a. 
the imperfect hypothesis generator, b. the Zipfian 
331
distribution of syntactic patterns, c. the incom-
plete partition over SCF types of a given verb. 
The first problem mainly comes from the inade-
quate parsing performance and noises existing in 
the corpus, while the other two problems are in-
herent to natural languages and should be solved 
in terms of acquisition techniques particularly 
during the process of hypothesis selection. 
2 Related Work 
The empirical background of this paper is the 
public resource for subcategorization acquisition 
of English verbs, provided by Anna Korhonen 
(2005) in her personal home page. The data in-
clude 30 verbs, as shown in Table 1, and their 
unfiltered SCF hypotheses, which were auto-
matically generated via Briscoe and Carroll?s 
(1997) SCF acquisition system, and the manually 
established standard.

slice supply swing 
For each verb, there is a corpus of 1000 sen-
tences extracted from the BNC, and all together 
42 SCF types are involved in the corpus. The 
framework of Briscoe and Carroll?s system con-
sists of six overall components, which are ap-
plied in sequence to sentences containing a spe-
cific predicate in order to retrieve a set of SCFs 
for that verb: 
z A tagger, a first-order Hidden Markov 
Model POS and punctuation tag disam-
biguator. 
z A lemmatizer, an enhanced version of the 
General Architecture for Text Engineering 
project stemmer. 
z A probabilistic LR parser, trained on a 
tree-bank derived semi-automatically from 
the SUSANNE corpus, returns ranked 
analyses using a feature-based unification 
grammar. 
z A pattern extractor, which extracts 
subcategorization patterns, i.e. local 
syntactic frames, including the syntactic 
frames, including the syntactic categories 
and head lemmas. 
z A pattern classifier, which assigns patterns 
to SCFs or rejects them as unclassifiable. 
z A SCF filter, which evaluates sets of SCFs 
gathered for a predicate verb. 
Nowadays, in most related researches, the per-
formances of subcategorization acquisition sys-
tems are often evaluated in terms of precision, 
recall and F measure of SCF types (Korhonen, 
2001, 2002). Generally, precision is the percent-
age of SCFs that the system proposes correctly, 
while recall is the percentage of SCFs in the gold 
standard that the system proposes: 
 
Precision = 
 
 
Recall =  
 
 
F-measure =  
 
Here, true positives are correct SCF types pro-
posed by the system, false positives are incorrect 
SCF types proposed by system, and false nega-
tives are correct SCF types not proposed by the 
system. 
3 The MLE Filtering Method 
The present SCF acquisition system for English 
verbs employs a MLE filter to test the automati-
cally generated SCF hypotheses. Due to noises 
accumulated while tagging, lemmatizing and 
parsing the corpus, even though correction is im-
plemented for some typical errors when classify-
ing the extracted patterns, the hypothesis genera-
tor does not perform as efficiently as hoped. 
Sampling analysis on the unfiltered hypotheses 
in Korhonen?s evaluation corpus indicates that 
about 74% incorrectly proposed and rejected 
SCF types come from the defects of the MLE 
filtering method. 
Performance of the MLE filter is closely re-
lated to the actual distributions p(scfi|v) over 
predicates and SCF types in the input corpus. 
First, from the overall corpus a training set is 
drawn randomly; it must be large enough to en-
sure a similar distribution. Then, the frequency 
of a subcategorization frame scfi occurring with a 
verb v is recorded and used to estimate the prob-
ability p(scfi|v). Thirdly, an empirical threshold ? 
is determined, which ensures that a maximum 
332
value of the F-measure will result for the training 
set. Finally, the threshold is used to filter out 
from the total set those SCF hypotheses with fre-
quencies lower than ?.  
Therefore, the statistical foundation of this fil-
tering method is the assumption of independence 
among the SCFs that a verb enters, which can be 
probabilistically expressed in two formulas as 
follows: 
0),|(,,, =??? vscfscfpjiji ji ? (1) 
?
=
=
n
i
i vscfp
1
1)|(                          ? (2) 
Here, i and j are natural numbers, scfi and scfj are 
two SCF types that verb v enters, and variables in 
formulas henceforth will hold the same meanings. 
In actual application, the probability p(scfi|v) is 
estimated from the observed frequency f(scfi, v), 
and the conditional probability p(scfi|scfj, v) is 
assumed to be zero. This means any two SCF 
types entered by a given verb are taken for 
granted to be probabilistically independent from 
each other. However, this assumption can some-
times be far from appropriate. 
4 Diathesis Alternations and Filtering 
Much linguistic research focusing on child lan-
guage acquisition has revealed that many chil-
dren are able to produce new grammatical sen-
tences from what they have learned (Peters, 1983; 
Ellis, 1985). This implies that the widely-used 
independence assumption in the field of NLP 
may not be very appropriate, at least for syntactic 
patterns. If this assumption should be removed, a 
possible heuristic could be the information of 
diathesis alternations, which is also another con-
vincing counterargument. Diathesis alternations 
are generally regarded as alternative ways in 
which verbs express their arguments. Examples 
are as follows: 
a. He broke the glass. 
b. The glass broke. 
c. Ta1 chi1 le0 pin2guo3. 
? ? ? ???(         ) 
d. Ta1 ba3 pin2guo3 chi1 le01. 
?? ?? ???(         ) 
In the above examples, the English verb break 
takes the causative-inchoative alternation as 
shown in sentences a and b, while sentences c 
and d indicate that the Chinese verb chi1 ? ( , eat) 
may enter the ba-object-raising alternation where 
the object is shifted forward by the preposition 
ba3 ? ( ) to the location between the subject and 
the predicate, as illustrated in Figure 1. 
                                                 
1 The numbers in sentences c and d, which are pinyin nota-
tions, show tones of the Chinese syllables, and the two sen-
tences, in English, generally mean He ate an apple.

Subcategorization of verbs has much to do 
with diathesis alternations, and most SCF re-
searchers regard information of diathesis alterna-
tion as an indispensable part of subcategorization 
(Korhonen, 2001; McCarthy, 2001). Therefore, 
one may conclude that, for subcategorization 
acquisition, the independence assumption sup-
porting the MLE filter is not as appropriate as 
previously thought.  
For a given verb, the assumption will be ap-
propriate and sufficient if and only if there is no 
diathesis alternation between all the SCFs it en-
ters, and formula (1) and (2) in Section 3 are ef-
ficient enough to serve as a foundation for the 
MLE filtering method. Otherwise, if there are 
diathesis alternations between some of the SCFs 
that a verb enters, then formula (1) and (2) must 
be modified as illustrated in formula (3) and (4). 
In either case, for the sake of convenience, it 
would be better to combine the formulas as 
shown in (5) and (6).

For English verbs, previous research has 
achieved great progress in diathesis alternation 
and relative applications, such as the work of 
Levin (1993) and McCarthy (2001). Besides, 
Korhonen (1998) has proved that diathesis alter-
nation could be used as heuristic information for 
backoff estimates to improve the general per-
formance of subcategorization acquisition. How-
ever, determining where and how to seed the 
heuristic remains difficult. 
Korhonen (1998) employed diathesis alterna-
tions in Briscoe and Carroll?s system to improve 
the performance of their BHT filter. Although 
the precision rate increased from 61.22% to 
333
69.42% and the recall rate from 44.70% to 
50.81%, the results were still not accurate 
enough for possible practical NLP uses.  
Korhonen obtained her one-way diathesis al-
ternations from the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev 
and Briscoe, 1987), calculated the alternating 
probability p(scfj|scfi) according to the number of 
common verbs that took the alternation 
(scfi?scfj), and used formula (7) and (8), where 
w is an empirical weight, to adjust the previously 
estimated p(scfi|v): 
If p(scfi|scfj, v)>0,  
p(scfi|v) = p(scfi|v)?w(p(scfi|v)? 
 p(scfj| scfi))                  ?(7) 
If p(scfi|v)>0 & p(scfj|v)=0,  
p(scfi|v) = p(scfi|v)+w(p(scfi|v)? 
                p(scfj| scfi))                   ?(8)2 
Following the adjustment, a BHT filter with a 
confidence rate of 95% was used to check the 
SCF hypotheses. 
This method removes the assumption of inde-
pendence among SCF types but establishes an-
other assumption of independence between 
p(scfj|scfi) and certain verbs, which assumes that 
all verbs take each diathesis alternation with the 
same probability. Nevertheless, linguistic knowl-
edge tells us that verbs often enter different dia-
thesis alternations and can be classified accord-
ingly. Consider the following examples: 
e. He broke the glass. / The glass broke. 
f. The police dispersed the crowd.  
/ The crowd dispersed. 
g. Mum cut the bread. / *The bread cut. 
Both of the English verbs ?break? and ?disperse? 
can take the causative-inchoative alternation and, 
hence, may be classified together, while the verb 
?cut? does not take this alternation. Therefore, 
the newly established assumption doesn?t fit the 
actual situation either, and the probability sums 
?ip(scfi|v) and ?i,jp(scfi|scfj, v) neither need or 
can be normalized. 
Based on the above methodology, we formed a 
new filtering method with diathesis alternations 
as heuristic information, which is, in fact, de-
rived from the simple MLE filter and based on 
formula (5) and (6). The algorithm can be briefly 
expressed as shown in Table 2. 
 
                                                 
2 For the sake of consistency in this paper and for the con-
venience of understanding, formulae formats here are modi-
fied. They may look different from those of Korhonen 
(1998), but they are actually the same. 
Table 2. The New Filtering Method. 
For hypotheses of a given verb v, 
1. if p(scfi|v) > ?1,  
accept scfi into the output set S; 
2. else  
if p(scfi|v) > ?2, 
& p(scfi|scfj, v) > 0, 
& scfj?S, 
accept scfi into set S; 
3. Go to step 1 until S doesn?t increase.
In our method, two filters are employed. For 
each verb involved, first a common MLE filter is 
used, but it employs a threshold ?1 that is much 
higher than usual, and those SCF hypotheses that 
satisfy the requirement are accepted. Then, all of 
the remainder of the hypotheses are checked by 
another MLE filter seeded with diathesis alterna-
tions as heuristic information and equipped with 
a much lower threshold ?2. Any hypothesis scfi 
left out by the first filter will be accepted if its 
probability exceeds ?2 and it is an alternative of 
an SCF type scfj that has been accepted by the 
first filter, which means that p(scfi|scfj, v)>0 and 
scfj?S. The filtering process will be performed 
repeatedly for those unaccepted hypotheses until 
no more hypotheses can be accepted for the verb. 
5 Experimental Evaluation 
We implemented an acquisition experiment on 
Korhonen?s evaluation resources with the above-
mentioned filtering method.  
The diathesis alternations in use are also those 
provided by Korhonen, except that we used them 
in a two-way manner (scfi??scfj) instead of 
one-way (scfi?scfj), because the two involved 
SCF types are usually alternative pragmatic for-
mats of the concerned verb, as shown in exam-
ples in Section 3 and 4. 
In the experiment we empirically set ?1= 0.2, 
which is ten times of Korhonen?s threshold for 
her MLE filter; ?2= 0.002, which is one tenth of 
Korhonen?s. Thus, in a token set of hypotheses 
no more than 1000, an SCF type scfi will be ac-
cepted if it occurs two times or more and has a 
diathesis alternative type scfj already accepted for 
the verb. 
The gold standard was the manually analysed 
results by Korhonen. Precision, recall and F-
measure were calculated via expressions given in 
Section 2.  
Table 3 lists the performances of the baseline 
method of non-filtering (No_f), MLE filtering 
with ? = 0.02, and our filtering method on the 
334
evaluation corpus, and also gives the best results 
of Korhonen's method that is using extra seman-
tic information (Kor) to make a comparison. 
Here, Ab_R is the absolute recall ratio, Re_R the 
relative recall ratio, Ab_F the absolute F-
measure that is calculated from Precision and 
Ab_R, and Re_F the relative F-measure that is 
from Precision and Re_R. 
Table 3. Performance Comparison. 
Methods No-f MLE  ours Kor 
P(%) 47.85 67.89 91.18 87.1 
Ab_R(%) 34.62 32.52 32.52 71.2 
Re_R(%) 100 93.93 93.93 85.27
Ab_F 40.17 43.98 47.94 78.35
Re_F 64.73 78.81 92.53 86.18
The evaluation shows that our new filtering 
method improved the acquisition performance 
remarkably: a. Compared with MLE, precision 
increased by 23.29%, recall ratio remained un-
changed, absolute F-measure increased by 3.96, 
and relative F-measure increased by 13.72; b. 
Compared with Korhonen?s best results, preci-
sion, Re_R and Re_F also increased respec-
tively 3 . Thus, the general performance of our 
filtering method makes the acquired lexicon 
much more practical for further manual proof-
reading and other NLP uses. 
What?s more, the data shown in Table 3 im-
plies that there is little room left for improvement 
of the statistical filter, since the absolute recall 
ratio is only 2.1% lower than that of the non-
filtering method. Whereas, detailed analysis of 
the evaluation corpus shows that the hypothesis 
generator accounts for about 95% of those unre-
called and wrongly recalled SCF types, which 
indicates, for the present time, more improve-
ment efforts need to be made on the first step of 
subcategorization acquisition, i.e. hypothesis 
generation. 
6 Conclusion 
Our new filtering method removed the inappro-
priate assumptions and takes much more advan-
                                                 
3 Korhonen (2002) reported the non-filtering absolute recall 
ratio of her experiment was about 83.5%. She didn?t give 
any explanation with her evaluation resources why here 
non-filtering Ab_R was so much lower. Therefore, the 
Ab_R and Ab_F figures are not comparable here. 
tage of what can be observed in the corpus by 
drawing on the alternative relationship between 
SCF hypotheses with higher and lower frequen-
cies. Unlike the semantically motivated method 
(Korhonen, 2001, 2002), which is dependent on 
verb classifications that linguistic resources are 
able to provide, our filter needs no prior knowl-
edge other than reasonable diathesis alternation 
information and may work well for most verbs in 
other languages with sufficient predicative to-
kens. 
Our experimental results suggest that the pro-
posed technique improves the general perform-
ance of the English subcategorization acquisition 
system, and leaves only a little room for further 
improvement in statistical filtering methods. 
However, approaches that are more complicated 
still exist theoretically, for instance, some SCF 
types unseen by the hypothesis generator may be 
recalled by integrating semantic verb-
classification information into the system. 
More essential aspects of our future work, 
however, will focus on improving the perform-
ance of the hypothesis generator, and testing and 
applying the acquired subcategorization lexicons 
in some concrete NLP tasks.
