Abstract
Automatic post-editing (APE) systems aim at
correcting the output of machine translation
systems to produce better quality translations,
i.e. produce translations can be manually post-
edited with an increase in productivity. In this
work, we present an APE system that uses sta-
tistical models to enhance a commercial rule-
based machine translation (RBMT) system. In
addition, a procedure for effortless human eva-
luation has been established. We have tested
the APE system with two corpora of differ-
ent complexity. For the Parliament corpus, we
show that the APE system significantly com-
plements and improves the RBMT system. Re-
sults for the Protocols corpus, although less
conclusive, are promising as well. Finally,
several possible sources of errors have been
identified which will help develop future sys-
tem enhancements.
1 Introduction
Current machine translation systems are far from
perfect. To achieve high-quality output, the raw
translations they generate often need to be corrected,
or post-edited by human translators. One way of in-
creasing the productivity of the whole process is the
development of automatic post-editing (APE) sys-
tems (Dugast et al, 2007; Simard et al, 2007).

research programme Consolider Ingenio 2010:MIPRCV
(CSD2007-00018), and by the i3media Cenit project (CDTI
2007-1012).
Many of these works propose a combination of
rule-based machine translation (RBMT) and statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT) systems, in order to
take advantage of the particular capabilities of each
system (Chen and Chen, 1997).
A possible combination is to automatically post-
edit the output of a RBMT system employing a SMT
system. In this work, we will apply this technique
into two different corpora: Parliament and Proto-
cols. In addition, we will propose a new human eva-
luation measure that will deal with the impact of the
automatic post-editing.
This paper is structured as follows: after a brief
introduction of the RBMT, SMT, and APE systems
in Section 2, Section 3 details the carried out experi-
mentation, discussing its results. Finally, some con-
clusions and future work are presented in Section 4.
2 Systems description
Three different systems are compared in this work,
namely the RBMT, SMT, and APE systems.
Rule-based machine translation. RBMT was the
first approach to machine translation, and thus, a
relatively mature area in this field. RBMT sys-
tems are basically constituted by two components:
the rules, that account for the syntactic knowledge,
and the lexicon, which deals with the morphologi-
cal, syntactic, and semantic information. Both rules
and lexicons are grounded on linguistic knowledge
and generated by expert linguists. As a result, the
build process is expensive and the system is difficult
to maintain (Bennett and Slocum, 1985). Further-
more, RBMT systems fail to adapt to new domains.
217
Although they usually provide a mechanism to cre-
ate new rules and extend and adapt the lexicon,
changes are usually very costly and the results, fre-
quently, do not pay off (Isabelle et al, 2007).
Statistical machine translation. In SMT, transla-
tions are generated on the basis of statistical models,
which are derived from the analysis of bilingual text
corpora. The translation problem can be statistically
formulated as in (Brown et al, 1993). In practice,
several models are often combined into a log-linear
fashion. Each model can represent an important fea-
ture for the translation, such as phrase-based, lan-
guage, or lexical models (Koehn et al, 2003).
Automatic post-editing. An APE system can be
viewed as a translation process between the output
from a previous MT system, and the target language.
In our case, an APE system based on statistical mod-
els will be trained to correct the translation errors
made by a RBMT system. As a result, both RBMT
and SMT technologies will be combined in order to
increase the overall translation quality.
3 Experiments
We present some experiments carried out using the
introduced APE system, and comparing its perfor-
mance with that of the RBMT and SMT systems.
In the experimentation, two different English-to-
Spanish corpora have been chosen, Parliament and
Protocols, both of them provided by a professional
translation agency.
Corpora. The Parliament corpus consists of a se-
ries of documents from proceedings of parliamen-
tary sessions, provided by a client of the transla-
tion agency involved in this work. Most of the sen-
tences are transcriptions of parliamentary speeches,
and thus, with the peculiarities of the oral language.
Despite of the multi-topic nature of the speeches,
differences in training and test perplexities indicate
that the topics in test are well represented in the
training set (corpus statistics in Table 1).
On the other hand, the Protocols corpus is a
collection of medical protocols. This is a more
difficult task, as its statistics reflect in Table 1. There
are many factors that explain this complexity, such
as the different companies involved in training and
test sets, out-of-domain test data (see perplexity and
Table 1: Corpus statistics for Parliament and Protocols.
OOV stands for out-of-vocabulary words.

Evaluation. In order to assess the proposed sys-
tems, a series of measures have been considered. In
first place, some state-of-the-art automatic metrics
have been chosen to give a first idea of the quality of
the translations. These translations have been also
evaluated by professional translators to assess the in-
crease of productivity when using each system.
Automatic evaluation. The automatic assessment
of the translation quality has been carried out us-
ing the BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
(Papineni et al, 2002), and the Translation Error
Rate (TER) (Snover et al, 2006). The latter takes
into account the number of edits required to con-
vert the system output into the reference. Hence, this
measure roughly estimates the post-edition process.
Human evaluation. A new human evaluation
measure has been proposed to roughly estimate
the productivity increase when using each of the
systems in a real scenario, grounded on previous
works for human evaluation of qualitative fac-
tors (Callison-Burch et al, 2007). One of the de-
sired qualities for this measure was that it should
pose little effort to the human evaluator. Thus, a
binary measure was chosen, the suitability, where
the translations are identified as suitable or not sui-
table. A given translation is considered to be suitable
if it can be manually post-edited with effort savings,
i.e., the evaluator thinks that a manual post-editing
will increase his productivity. On the contrary, if the
evaluator prefers to ignore the proposed translation
and start it over, the sentence is deemed not suitable.
218
Significance tests. Significance of the results has
been assessed by the paired bootstrap resampling
method, described in (Koehn, 2004). It estimates
how confidently the conclusion that a system outper-
forms another one can be drawn from a test result.
Experimental setup. Rule-based translation was
performed by means of a commercial RBMT system.
On the other hand, statistical training and translation
in both SMT and APE systems were carried out using
the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007). It should be
noted that APE system was trained taking the RBMT
output as source, instead of the original text. In this
way, it is able to post-edit the RBMT translations.
Finally, the texts employed for the human eva-
luation were composed by 350 sentences randomly
drawn from each one of the two test corpora des-
cribed in this paper. Two professional translators
carried out the human evaluation.
3.1 Results and discussion
Experimentation results in terms of automatic and
human evaluation are shown in this section.
Automatic evaluation. Table 2 presents Parlia-
ment and Protocols corpora translation results in
terms of automatic metrics. Note that, as there is
a single reference, this results are somehow pes-
simistic.
In the case of the Parliament corpus, SMT system
outperforms the rest of the systems. APE results are
slightly worse than SMT, but far better than RBMT.
However, when moving to the Protocols corpus, a
more difficult task (as seen in perplexity in Table 1),
the results show quite the contrary. SMT and APE
systems show how they are more sensitive to out-
of-domain documents. Nevertheless, the RBMT sys-
tem seems to be more robust under such conditions.
Despite of the degradation of the statistical models,
APE manages to achieve much better results than the
other two systems. It is able to conserve the robust-
ness of RBMT, while its statistical counterpart deals
with the particularities of the corpus.
Human evaluation. Table 3 shows the percentage
of translations deemed suitable by the human eva-
luators. Two professional evaluators analysed the
suitability of the output of each system
In the Parliament case, APE performance is found
much more suitable than the rest of the systems. In
Table 2: Automatic evaluation for Parliament and Proto-
cols tests.

fact, this difference between APE and the rest is sta-
tistically significant at a 99% level of confidence.
In addition, significance tests show that, on average,
APE improves RBMT on 59.5% of translations.
Regarding to the Protocols corpus, it must be
noted that a first review of the translations pointed
out that the SMT system performed quite poorly.
Hence, SMT was not considered for the human eva-
luation on this corpus.
Figures show that APE complements and im-
proves RBMT, although differences between them
are tighter than in the Parliament corpus. However,
significance tests still prove that these improvements
are statistically significant (68% of confidence), and
that the average improvement is 6.5%.

It is interesting to note how automatic measures
and human evaluation seem not to be quite corre-
lated. In terms of automatic measures, the best sys-
tem to translate the Parliament test is the SMT. This
improvement has been checked by carrying out sig-
nificance tests, resulting statistically significant with
a 99% of confidence. However, in the human eva-
luation, SMT is worse than APE (this difference is
also significant at 99%). On the other hand, when
working with the Protocols corpus, automatic me-
trics indicate that APE improves the rest (significant
improvement at 99%). Nevertheless, human evalua-
tors seem to think that the difference between APE
and RBMT is not so significant, only with a confi-
dence of 68%. Previous works confirm this apparent
219
discrepancy between automatic and human evalua-
tions (Callison-Burch et al, 2007).
Translator?s commentaries. As a subproduct of
the human evaluation, the evaluators gave some
personal impressions regarding each system perfor-
mance. They concluded that, when working with the
Parliament corpus, there was a net improvement in
the overall performance when using APE. Changes
between RBMT and APE were minor but useful.
Thus, APE did not pose a system degradation with
respect to the RBMT. Furthermore, a rough estima-
tion indicated that over 10% of the sentences were
perfectly translated, i.e. the translation was human-
like. In addition, some frequent collocations were
found to be correctly post-edited by the APE system,
which was felt very effort saving.
With respect to the Protocols corpus, as expected,
results were found not so satisfactory. However,
human translators find themselves these documents
complex.
Finally, in both cases, APE is able to make the
translation more similar to the reference by fix-
ing some words without altering the grammatical
structure of the sentence. Finally, translators would
find very useful a system that automatically decided
when to automatically post-edit the RBMT outputs.
4 Conclusions
We have presented an automatic post-editing sys-
tem that can be added at the core of the professional
translation workflow. Furthermore, we have tested it
with two corpora of different complexity.
For the Parliament corpus, we have shown that
the APE system complements and improves the
RBMT system in terms of suitability in a real transla-
tion scenario (average improvement 59.5%). Results
for the Protocols corpus, although less conclusive,
are promising as well (average improvement 6.5%).
Moreover, 67% of Protocols translations, and 94%
of Parliament translations were considered to be sui-
table.
Finally, a procedure for effortless human eva-
luation has been established. A future improve-
ment for this would be to integrate the process in the
core of the translator?s workflow, so that on-the-fly
evaluation can be made. In addition, several pos-
sible sources of errors have been identified which
will help develop future system enhancements. For
example, as stated in the translator?s commentaries,
the automatic selection of the most suitable transla-
tion among the systems is a desirable feature.
