Previous research by the authors has been directed toward phonetic transcription of 
fluent speech. We have applied our techniques to speech recognition on the DARPA 
Resource Management Task. In order to perform speech recognition, however, the 
phonetic transcription must be interpreted as a sequence of words. A central 
component of this process is lexical access for which a novel method is proposed. 
The new technique treats lexical access as simply a string-to-string editing problem. 
That is, we seek the grammatically correct sequence of words whose phonetic spelling, 
as given in a dictionary, is closest, in a well defined sense, to the computed phonetic 
transcription of an actual utterance. The distance between two phonetic units is taken 
as the Euclidean distance between the means of their respective spectral and durational 
densities. This measure is called the rhobar metric and is known to have many 
interesting properties. This measure is especially appealing here since the needed 
densities are already present in the hidden Markov model on which the phonetic 
transcriptions are based. We extend this metric heuristically to the case of insertions 
and deletions by using the distance between the inserted or deleted unit and silence. 
The string-to-string editing operation is then easily performed by a two-level dynamic 
programming algorithm in which the inner level performs lexical access and the outer 
level does the parsing. 
The method has been applied to the DARPA continuous peech recognition task using 
the strict task grammar. The acoustic/phonetic model was derived from 3969 sentences 
recorded from 109 speakers. Model parameters were obtained from sample statistics 
computed on the basis of phonetic segmentation performed by a segmental k-means 
algorithm. 
Rather than attempt o measure phonetic accuracy, we have synthesized the speech 
from the phonetic transcription augmented by computed uration and pitch. The result 
is remarkably intelligible, especially when considering that it is equivalent to a 120 
BPS coder. Audio tapes of the synthesized speech are available from the authors. We 
also tested our system on the October 1989 DARPA Test Data. Although the best 
speaker (speaker #1) achieved an 82% word accuracy rate, The overall word accuracy 
on the 10 speakers was 57.2% comprising 27.3% substitutions, 12.9% insertions, 2.7% 
deletions and 70.2% correct classifications. The high error rate is the result of 
catastrophic failure of the recognizer in which occasional sentences are entirely 
misrecognized. We do not yet understand the cause of this failure mode. 
Although these results are disappointing, the high quality of the phonetic transcription 
and the simplicity of the architecture are an incentive to continue the research.
