bv German ?~rammaro 
we bel ieve that the present understanding of 
structural  di f ferences between languages does 
not yet allow for a single parsing algorithm, 
at least if one wants both good coverage and 
eff iciency? As a consequence we developed a 
parser which is speci f ical ly  designed to cope 
with the pecul iar i t ies  of the German language. 
Nevertheless, since our approach is based on 
sound l inguist ic principles, most of the solu- 
t ions found could be appl ied to other 
languages with a similar structure as well. 
I n  this paper' we will  focus on the  core of the 
system's parsing component and neglect other 
features like spel l ing correction, treatment 
of anaphoric or el l ipt ic utterances, quantif-  
ier seeping and the transformat ion into SQL.

DB~DIALOG is a German language interface to 
relat ional  data bases? Our object ives were: 
to design a system which has good language 
capabi l i t ies  and which at the same time is 
easi ly portable. The system has bee~ 
developed on a SYMBOLICS 3600 and up to no~ 
has been transported to a PRIME-550II~ a DEC -i 
VAX 730, and a NIXDORF TARGON-35o 
DB-DIALOG translates user-quer ies given in the 
fo~m of wr i t ten German sentences into struc- 
tured SQL statements? Since SQL is the de- 
facto standard query language for relat ional  
database systems, a wide range of database 
systems is accessible. The only adaptat ion to 
be done is a t ransformat ion uf the structured 
SQL output by DB-DIAI.OG into the special  SQL 
used by the spscif ic DBMSo At the moment ver- 
sions for ORACLE, REFLEX and MIMER are imple- 
mentedo 
in some other ways the interface is also 
designed to be as portable as possible? Adap- 
tat lon -to new domains is faci l i tated by keep- 
in q the linguistic, coverage separate from the 
actual domain knowledge which rests solely in 
the \].exlcon. Independence from the model ing 
of the domain in the data base is achieved by 
d ist inguish ing between a l inguist ica l ly  
mot ivated descr ipt ion of the domain and a 
database~,orlented one. Tllsre is an expl ic i t  
"translation step between these two parts. 
Language independence i s  not aimed at, because 
figure io For a descr ipt ion of the interface 
as a whole see Buchberger et ai./1987/. 
We have chosen to base our parser on semantic 
caseframe instantiation. Such an approach is 
well suited for a restr icted domain parser, 
because of its ef f ic iency (by avoiding useless 
parses in case of syntactic ambiguity) and its 
robustness in the case of ungrammatica l i ty  
(see eog. Gr ishman et a\]./1986/). On the other 
hand, relying solely on that method, it would 
be di f f icult  to capture syntactic general i t ies 
(Cog.act ive-passive transformation),  because 
syntact ic as well as semantic restr ict ions 
must be specif ied expl ic i t ly for each slot of 
overycasef rame.  This means that for every 
di f ferent syntactic real izat ion of the same 
statement a di f ferent caseframe has to be pro- 
v ided in the lexicon. There are two severe 
drawbacks to this kind of real ization: First, 
general  syntact ic propert ies of the language 
are impl ic i t ly  stated in the lexicon entries 
instead of expl ic i t ly  in the grammar leading 
to a poss ib ly  inconsistent and patchy syntac- 
tic coverage?' Second, the lexicon is inf lated 
because for a single word (meaning) a number 
of di f ferent caseframes is needed. 
To i l lustrate the problem let's have a look a% 
an example: 
'liefern' (= to deliver) 
could have the fol lowing caseframe:

In const i tuents (with str ict word order) the 
CFM is invoked direct ly  and tries to bui ld up 
a caseffame (or more than one in case of 
ambiguity)? The result is returned to the 
ATN which makes use of it during further 
processing? 
In structures with free const i tuent order 
(clauses) the ATN acts solely as a col lector  
The words are first processed mo~pholog ica l ly  
and a chart is returned, rendering a 
canonical  form for each of the words together 
with word class and syntact ic information 
(e?g. case markers). At this level, some 
ambiguit ies a~ise, eogo that of "welche" 
which might be an interrogat ive pronoun or a 
relat ive one, and "die" which may be an 
art ic le or e relat ive pronoun.

Fig.2: Morphological  chart 
of constituents. Const i tuent caseframes are 
merely  stored in a local chart and attachment 
i s  postponed? The only const i tuent  
recognized topologica l ly  is the head which 
always comes in the last position? This 
chart of const i tuents Ks then given to the 
uni f icat ion process when the POP arc is 
reached. In addit ion to relying heavi ly  on 
the CFM, the uni f icator  also has var ious 
strategies at its disposal in order to take 
into considerat ion restr ict ions of adjacency 
and category dependent of the category of the 
phrase processed? This way possible 
syntact ic ambiguity is m~duced and almost no 
backtracking is needed inside the ATNo 
Generally, information passed to the CFM is 
col lected while traversing the subnet: head 
caseframes are instantiated, arguments and 
modif iers are col lected by pushing the 
appropriate subnets and morphological and/or 
syntact ic clues tr igger various informations 
on the caseframes? 
AS an example we ment ion the passive 
? transformation: if evidence for passive is 
gathered whi le analyzing the verbal complex 
(for S) or a part ic ip le (for APs), this 
information is passed on to the CFM. The CFM 
then appl ies the passive t ransformat ion to 
the relevant slots of the head caseframe 
before the slot f i l l ing takes place. These 
transformat ions are one way to take general 
syntact ic information away from the lexicon 
(the caseframes) to reduce redundancy /Hayes 
et ai.1985/. 
6. An Annotated Example 
To demonstrate how the system works, we wil l  
conclude the paper by giving an annotated 
example of a parse. For the sake of c lar i ty  
some of the detai ls shall be simplif ied, but 
all of the essentials wil l  be proper ly  
described. 
We have chosen the fol lowing example 
sentence: 
"Welche yon unseren Abte i lungen in Wien 
bezieht fuer die Produkt ion benoet igte Stoffe 
von Firmen aus dem Ausland?" ("Which of our 
Viennese departments gets mater ia ls  necessary 
for product ion purposes from abroadT") 
Please note that the free t rans lat ion does 
not capture the grammatical  subt let ies 
involved in the original  sentence ;espec ia l l y  
the adject ive phrase "fuer die Produkt ion 
ber.oet~gte Stoffe" includes a pass iv izat lon 
that tis usual ly  not expressed this way in 
English. 
68O 
There is a simple global control structure 
which works on this morphological  chart? Its 
main task is to transfer control to ATN 
networks for phrase- l ike const i tuents and %o 
the unl f icator  for c lause- l ike constituents? 
The control structure starts by transferr ing 
control to the PP/NP-ATNo The chart entry for 
"Ausland" is treated first ( remember the 
r ight- to- lef t  d irect ion of processing),  i~ 
is found to be a noun, and the next edge, 
DET, is processed. The third word, "aus", 
f inishes the PP/NP. Control is transferz'ed 
to the caseframe marcher (CFM). The 
caseframe for the head, "Ausland", becomes 
instantiated, and the features of the other 
components are uni f ied with it, especia l ly  
the feature of dative, which is der ived from 
the determiner. 
After complet ion of this caseframe, control  
is t ransferred back to the PP/NP net which 
processes "yon Firmen" in a s imilar way? The 
CFM is cal led again, construct ing another 
caseframe~ According to our strategy, PP 
attachment wil l  not be performed at thls 
step, instead all the const i tuents wil l  be 
col lected first? 
The PP/NP ATN gets its next chance? It 
treats the chart entry for "Stoffe ~ which 
makes a perfect ly  suitable head for a more 
complex constituent.  We start to ant ic ipate 
this when the next word, "benoetigte" 
("necessary" - albeit not an adjectives but a 
PPP in German), is processed. In general, 
inf lected PPPs tr igger a PUSH AP, so does 
this one. (Uninf lected PPPs form part of the 
verb complex). Next, a PUSH PP/NP is 
performed which wil l  lead to a const i tuent 
embedded in the APe Hut let's see this in 
detail. The PP is processed s imi lar  to %he 
others before, the head "Produktion" becoming 
instant iated and the caseframe f i l led after 
the entry for "fuer" has been processed. 
This f inishes the AP, since the verb, 
"bez ieht" ,  def in i te ly  cannot be part of an 
AP. As you may remember, APs t~Igger th~ 
uni f icat ion component which in turn cal ls the 
CFM to handle the simpler tasks. Thus, th~ 
head of the AP, "benoetlgte", becomes 
instantlatedo The associated caeeframe lu

(SYN SUBJ) (SEM ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT) 
(SYN DOBJ) (SEM MATERIAL) 
(SYN PPOBJ (FUER)) (SEM PURPOSE)) 
Before the caseframe will  be filled~ a 
passive t ransformat ion is applied, due to the 
fact that the example sentence contained the 
verb "benoet igen"  in its PPP re,me This 
t ransformat ion simply changes SUBJ to

Let us take a l i t t le  d igress ion~ Suppose  the 
PP/NP ~'fuer die P rodukt ion"  wou ld  not  have

"gefaerbte"  ("dyed")  ins tead  of "benoet ig te"  
'this wo%~id do. In th is  case we wou ld  not  get 
the ree~ding "mater ia l s  dyed fo r  product ion

The soph is t i ca ted  reader  cou ld  argue that  'the 
f i rs t  read ing  might  a lso be correct .  The

exc lud ing  a theoret i ca l  ambigu i ty  where  in

the  slot  f i l l ing  fails, the AP..ATN will. 
backt rack .  We get an AP cons is t ing  of just  
one s ing le  word  ( "gefaerbte")  f i l l ing  a s lot  
in "Stoffe",  mak ing  up for one PP/NP and 
another  PP/NP, namely  "fuer die Produkt ion" .  
These two PP /NPs  wi l l  be co l lec ted  at th is  
s tage of p rocess ing  and on ly  a t tached  when 
all of -the sentence  wi l l  have been parsed.  
We wi l l  stop our d ig ress ion  here a**d  come 
back to the or ig ina l  example? Remember,  the 
AP has ,lust been f ln i shed  and the PP/NP w i th  
the head "Stoffe" is POPped? This  means a 
t rans fer  of contro l  to the CFM (in PP/NPs  the 
CFM is ca l led  d i~ect ly ,  whereas  in an AP or  S 
tile un l f i ca tor  is ca l led  f i rst  in o~der  to 
:find cor rec t  at tachments?  A f terwards ,  the 
un i f l ca tor  in turn ca l ls  the CFM to rea l i ze  
? the se lec ted  a t tachments  ). The AI? is 
in tegrated  into the PP/NP case f rame as a 
mod i f ie r  p red icate  in the MOD sloto The SUBJ  
s lot  of the subord inated  case f rame (the one 
of "benoet igen"  ) is st i l l  unf i l led.  For 
syntact i c  reasons,  its f i l le r  must  be the  
head of the superord inated  PP/NP "Stoffe"o 
The semant ic  res t r i c t ion  of the SUBJ  s lot  is 
MATERIAL  wh ich  is compat ib le  w i th  the noun 
"Stoffe",  so the s lot  may be f i l l ed  (note 
that  SUBJ  is the t rans formed syntact i c  
/ 'estriction wh ich  had been DOBJ  before  the 
pass ive  t rans format ion  had taken p lace ) o 
Thus, a th i rd  const i tuent  has been added to 
the pool  of co l lec ted  const i tuents?  
The g lobal  contro l  s t ruc ture  ce*rtinues by 
process ing  the next  entry, the representat ion  
of the word  "bezieht",  wh ich  is a f in i te  verb  
and has to be at the second pos i t ion  
accord ing  to German grammar? It is set as ide 
for later  p rocess ing  and a spec ia l  state is 
entered,  knowing  that exact ly  one const i tuent  
has been  left  over? The PP/NP "in Wien" is 
processed,  and a cor respond ing  case f~ame is 
created.  
S imi lar ly ,  a case f rame for "welche yon 
unseren  Abte i lungen"  is c reated  and "in Wien"  
is a t tached  to it when the un i f i ca tor  app l ies  
its knowledge  that there cannot  be more than 
one const i tuent  in th is  pos i t ion.  This  way, 
poss ib le  ambigu i t ies  e.g? t ry ing  to f i l l  "in

has a l ready  been f i l l ed  in the SUBJ  slot, se

7. Conclus ion 
In th is  paper  we have descr ibed  a parser  
wh ich  is ab le  to deal  w i th  a w ide  var ie ty  of  
German sentences  in an e f f i c ient  and robust  
wry. Th is  is made poss ib le  by two spec ia l  
p roper t ies  of  the parser:  
First,  syntact i c  ana lys i s  uses two  ' d i f fe rent  
s t rateg ies ,  namely  an ATN and un i f i ca t ion  "to 
deal  w i th  f ixed word  o~der  at the eonsh:\[tu~;nt 
level  and free corrstituent o rder  at the 
c lause  level  r sspect ive ly?  Such an app'~'oaeh 
i . s  wel l  su i ted  fox' German,  but  a lso  for o ther  
SOV languages  l ike Dutch, Swedish,  Dan ish  and 
Japanese  ? 
Second, the in teract ion  between case f ram~ 
ins tant ia t ion  and a syntact i c  parser  leads to 
the poss ib i l i ty  of 
- c lear  and prec ise  fo rmulat ion  of  syntact i c  
and semant ic  ru les  and regu lar i t ies ,
