Abstract
We have proposed a method of word segmen-
tation for non-segmented language using Induc-
tive Learning. This method uses only surface
information of a text, so that it has an ad-
vantage that is entirely not dependent on any
specific language. In this method, we consider
that a character string of appearing frequently
in a text has a high possibility as a word. The
method predicts unknown words by recursively
extracting common character strings. With the
proposed method, the segmentation results can
adapt to different users and fields. To evaluate
effectivety for Chinese word segmentation and
adaptability for different fields, we have done
the evaluation experiment with Chinese text of
the two fields.
1 Instruction
In NLP applications, word segmentation of non-
segmented language is a very necessary initial
stage(Sun et al, 1998). In the other hands,
with the development of the Internet and popu-
larization of computers, a large amount of text
information in different languages on the In-
ternet are increasing explosively, so it is nec-
essary to develop a common method to deal
with multi-language(Yamasita and Matsumoto,
2000). Furthermore, the standard of word seg-
mentation is dependent on a user and destina-
tion of use(Sproat et al, 1996), so that it is nec-
essary that word segmentation can adapt users,
can deal with multi languages.
In our method, we extract recursively a
common character string that occur frequently
in text and call it a common part. When
some common parts contain still same charac-
ter strings, furthermore we extract the same
character string as high dimensional common
parts and the remain parts is called different
parts. The high dimensional common parts
maybe have higher possibility as words because
it is extracted by multi steps. Those extracted
common parts and different parts are called
WS(Word Segment), and classified into some
ranks according to extracting condition. The
proposed method segments a non-segmented
sentence into words using the ranks of WS in
order of the higher value of the certainty de-
grees as words. When there are multiple seg-
mentation candidates, the system gets a list of
segmentable candidates, and picks a correct seg-
mentation candidate from the list by using a
value of LEF (Likelihood Evaluation Function,
Section 2.1) and so on. In addition, it is not
necessary to prepare a dictionary and any word
segmentation rules beforehand. A dictionary of
adapting to the user or the field is generated
with increasing of processed text. Because only
surface information of a text is used, it is possi-
ble the method is used to deal with general non-
segmented language. Here Inductive Learning
is the procedure to extract recursively WS by
multi steps(Araki et al, 1995).

(2) For the remaining part of the charac-
ter strings that are unsegmented by the known
words, the system predicts unknown words by
extracting WS using Inductive Learning.
The system extracts WS as word candidates.
This process is based on the supposition that a
common character string of appearing repeat-
edly in text has high probability as a word.
(3) The user judges whether the results of the
word segmentation is correct or not. If there are
errors in the result, the user will correct errors.
(4) The system compares the proofread re-
sults with the segmentation result to update
the information in the dictionary. Through this
procedure, the certainty of WS as a word is con-
firmed and increased.
Here, the WS those are used in correct seg-
mentation are called CW (Correct Word).
2.1 Segmentation by Known Words
Input sentence and then the system segments
it into words by registered CW and WS that
the system has got by using Inductive Learning
until that time.
(1) In the first step, the system compares the
registered CW or WS in the dictionary with
the character string in the input sentence from
the beginning of the sentence, and finds out
the same character strings with the registered
words. The system repeats this comparison pro-
cess until the end of the sentence is reached.
A list of segmentation candidate is established.
Then the system segments the sentence into
words.
(2) In the second step, however, for the char-
acter strings of multiple segmentations, we use
the registered candidates in order of their ranks
in the dictionary(Section 2.3). When there are
more than one word candidate with the same
rank, we decide the correct segmentation from
the list of segmentation candidates by the value
of LEF. We define LEF as follows:
LEF = FR + ?CS ? ?ES + ?LE
FR +CS ? ES + LE
(1)
Where: FR, CS, ES and LE are the fre-
quency of CW or WS appearing in the text, the
frequency of the correct segmentation, the fre-
quency of the erroneous segmentation and the
length of CW orWS respectively. ?, ? and ? are
coefficients. The optimum coefficients of LEF
are decided by the preliminary experiments us-
ing Greedy method, ?=10, ?=1 and ?=5.
The word that has the maximum value of
LEF is decided as the correct segmentation can-
didate.
(3) When LEF value of the set of possible
segmentations is equal to each other, the cor-
rect segmentation candidate is decided by the
word candidate that the value of ES is mini-
mum, the value of CS is maximum, the value of
FR is maximum, the value of LE is the longest
or the location of segmentation is the leftmost
in a sentence in turn.
2.2 Prediction for Unknown Words
Fig. 2 shows an example of a non-segmented
sentence. In this example, every character rep-
resents a Chinese character, so we use this ex-
ample to express a general sentence of non-
segmented language to present the proposed
method. Those words that are not registered in
the dictionary are predicted by using Inductive
Learning. After the sentences were segmented
by known words, which have been registered in
the dictionary, the unsegmented part of char-
acter string will be used to extract WS. The
prediction method is to find the common char-
acter string in text. The extraction procedure
is carried out as Fig. 3 shows: the extraction
of common parts, sift out the common part of
the most possibility as a word, the re-extraction
of common parts and the extraction of different
parts.
???????????????????
????????????????.
Figure 2: An example of non-segmented sen-
tence.
2.2.1 Extraction of a Common Part
A common part in non-segmented text is ex-
tracted by two steps:
(1) When a character string appears in text
frequently, we call it a common character string.
If the common character string consists of more
than two characters, we extract it as a word can-
didate and call it common part and represent it
by S1(Segment one). Here, we use length, fre-
quency and location of S1 in the sentence to sift
out it, to get the S1 of the most possible as a
word. At this step, we acquired S1 from the
sentence that is shown in Fig. 2: ??????,????
and ????????.
(2) When the character string appears in the
sentence only one times but meanwhile it is
included in other extracted common part and
made up by more than two characters, we also
extract it as a word candidate. For example in
Fig. 2: ????? is included in ????????. There-
fore ????? is extracted and belongs to S1.
2.2.2 Extraction of a High Dimensional
Common Part and a Different
Part
The extracted S1 at 2.2.1 may still include a
common character string. At this situation, the
common character string can be re-extracted
moreover from the extracted S1. We consider
it has a higher probability as a word that re-
extracted common parts at this procedure. The
conditions of re-extraction are presented as fol-
lows:
(1) The common part can be re-extracted
from the extracted S1 when it includes a com-
mon character string that is more than two
characters. For example, ???????? contains
????? which can be extracted from ????????,
so ???????(S1)? is equal to ????(S2)? +
????(S3)?.
The part of re-extraction is called high di-
mensional common part and represented by S2
(Segment two). The part of remain is called
different part and represented by S3 (Segment
three). The S1 is deleted from the dictionary

when it is divided into S2 and S3.
(2) Furthermore one character can also be ex-
tracted as a word candidate when both sides
of it are extracted as a word candidate or
both sides were segmented by known words.
Like ??? in ????????????? is surrounded by
???????? and ??????, and ??? is extracted
as a word candidate belonging to S2.
The extraction procedure is carried out re-
peatedly until the new WS can not be extracted
and the input can not be segmented.
2.3 Segmentation by a Update
Dictionary
The extracted WS are classified to ?S1?, ?S2?,
and ?S3?. Those WS that are confirmed
as a word by proofreading process are called
?CW? (Correct Word). Furthermore, the
FR(appearing FRequency), CS(Correct Seg-
mentation frequency), ES(Erroneous Segmen-
tation frequency), LE(LEength) and rank of a
word candidate are rigestered simultaneously.
Word Segmentation is carried out by the up-
date dictionary as 2.1.
2.4 Feedback Process
After the system segments the sentence into
words, the results are judged whether they are
correct or not by the user. Then the user cor-
rects the errors if there are errors in the results.
The system updates the rank of the registered
CW andWS in the dictionary by comparing the
corrected results with the segmentation results.
And the system increases the priority degree of
the words that were used in correct segmenta-
tion and decreases the priority degree of words
that were used in erroneous segmentations. The

feedback process is described in detail as follows:
(1) For the Correct Segmentation Results:
 When the result of segmentation is correct,
the value of FR and CS of a word that is
used to segment are added one.
 If the rank of the words does not belong to
CW, it is changed to CW.
(2) For the Erroneous Segmentation Results:
 If the dictionary does not has the correct
words, the system registers the words in the
dictionary. In this case, their FRs are 1,
their ranks are CW.
 If the dictionary has the correct words, the
system adds one to the value of FR for a
word and changes the value of CL to CW
if it does not belong to CW.
 If the reason of erroneous segmentation is
that the erroneous word was used, then the
ES of erroneous word is added one.
(3) For the Unsegmented Parts:
 The system registers the words in the dic-
tionary, as FR of the words equal 1 and
rank equal CW.
3 Evaluation Experiments
3.1 Experimental Data And Procedure
To evaluate the adaptability of the proposed
method for different fields and the effectivity for
Chinese word segmentation. We use the Chi-
nese text of two specialized fields from Sinica
Corpus1: the economics contains 92,085 words
and the engineering contains 70,017 words. To-
tal words is 162,102. The economics consists of
the text of economic system, economic policy
and economic theory. The engineering consists
of the text of electronics, communication engi-
neering, machine engineering and nuclear indus-
try.

In order to confirm the adaptability of pro-
posed method to user, we let the initial dic-
tionary empty. We input a paragraph about
hundred words one times and two fields text in
turns.
3.2 Experimental Results
The results of experiment are shown in Table
1. Fig. 4 shows the change of CSR, ESR and
USR. In our method, the correct segmentation
number is the number of correct segmentation
that is judged by a user. The unsegmentation
number is the number when all unsegmented
strings are segmented correctly. The erroneous
segmentation number is the number that sub-
tracts the number of correct segmentation and
unsegmentation from the number of all words
in the input text. To evaluate the experiment
result, we use these formulas of CSR (Correct
Segmentation Rate), ESR (Erroneous Segmen-
tation Rate) and USR (Unsegmented Rate) as
follows:
CSR[%] = Correct segmentationnumber

USR[%] = UnsegmentationnumberTotal number of words ? 100 (4)

Figure 5: The ability to predict unknown words
is fall down temporary. However with increasing
of processed sentence, the correct segmentation
rate goes on increasing quickly.
We may consider that the proposed method
has adaptability for different fields. Sometimes
the correct segmentation rate is a little lower
because the domain of text is a little difference,
for example: the economics consists of the text
of economic system, economic policy and eco-
nomic theory and so on.
4.2 Evaluation of Ability for Predicting
Unknown Words
We use 50,000 words to discuss the predicting
ability of proposed method for unknown words.
Precision[%] = CWN
TWN
? 100 (5)
Recall[%] = CWN
TUN
? 100 (6)
Where, CWN is the number of words that are
predicted correctly. TWN is the total number
of words that are predicted. TUN is the total
number of unknown words.
The precision and recall are shown in Fig. 5.
The average precision is 26.0%. The average
recall is 31.0%. With increasing of registered
words in the dictionary, prediction effect for
unknown words is becoming well, after 40,000
words are processed the precision and the recall
are 85.0%, 40.0% respectively.
4.3 Analysis of Erroneous
Segmentation
We select 1,000 words from the beginning of the
experimental date and the end of the experi-
mental date respectively, to analysis the reason
of an erroneous segmentation. At the begin-
ning, ESR that is because of unregistered words
is 18.0%, but after 16,000 words are processed,
ESR that is because of unregistered words is
0.9%. However ESR that is caused by ambigu-
ity goes on increasing from 1.6% to 7.0%. ESR
caused by ambiguity is increasing with increas-
ing of registered word in the dictionary. Am-
biguous segmentation is still a difficult problem,
so that it is necessary to improve the ability to
deal with ambiguity.
5 Conclusion
The experiment results show the prediction
ability for unknown words by using Inductive
Learning. The experiment results of two fields
shown the proposed method can adapt to dif-
ferent fields text. In this paper, the emphasis is
to evaluate the adaptivity of the method to dif-
ferent user and fields. About comparison with
other existed methods will be done in the future.
The proposed method may be used to
computer-aided acquisition of language re-
source. The experimental results show our
proposed method has ability of learning, pre-
dictability for unknown words and effectivity
for Chinese word segmentation. For the future
works, we plan to improve the ability of dealing
with segmentation ambiguity, and use this pro-
posed method for Chinese morphological anal-
ysis.
