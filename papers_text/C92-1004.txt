Antonio ZAMPOLLI, Chairman of the Programme Committee 
The scientific programme of COLING-92 
In my capacity as Chairman of the Scientific Programme 
Committee of COLING-92, I wish to express my 
gratitude to all my colleagues who have conributed to 
the reading and selection of about 420 papers ubmitted 
for COLING-92. The work of the Programme 
Committee has been organized at two levels. In 
consultation with the members of the Intermltional 
Committee on Computational Linguistics, I have 
identified nine major areas of interest, and fro" each area I
have appointed a coordinator. Each of the nine 
coordinators, whieb together formed the Programme 
Committee, has set up a subcommittee, selecting a 
number of reviewers. 
The task of the coordinator was to distribute tbe papers 
to the reviewers, to collect and summarize their 
evaluations, and to express an overall recommendation: 
to accept a paper as topical, to accept he paper as a 
project note, or to reject the paper. I have always 
followed the recommendations of the coordinators. The 
tew papers which, in each area, were classified as 
"uncertain", i.e. left without a specific recommendation, 
were ranked in descending order of acceptability by the 
coordinator. In these cases, I have used the following 
criteria for acceptance: i) within each area, the ranking of 
the coordinator has been respected, ii) across areas, 
preference has been given to papers accompanied by a 
demonstration, and to topics less represented in the 
overall programme. 
1 also wish to express my appreciation tomy colleagues 
N Calzolari, A. Capelli, P. Orsolini, and S. Rossi of 
the Istituto di Linguistica Computazionate of the CNR 
of Pisa for their generous support in the task of 
classifying and distributing the papers, collecting the 
judgements, and setting file final programme. 
My deepest gratitude must go to Ch. Boitet and 
F. Peccond for their contribution to the work of the 
Programme Committee, and for tile enthusiasm and the 
energy they have given in organizing the Conlerence. 1 
can fully appreciate he quantity of work required lot file 
organizatitm of a COLING Conference, since I have 
already been involved in the organization of the 
Conference twice before: in 1978 (Bergen) as Chairman 
of the Progr;nnme COlnlnittee, and in 1973 (Pisa) as 
local organizer. 
Recollecting these two COLING Conlk~'rences, two 
ctmsiderations regarding developments in our field come 
to mind. In my Introduction to tile proceedings of 
COLING-73 (A. Zampoll i ,  N. Calzolari ,  eds., 
Computational nd Mathematical Linguistics, Firenze, 
1977, 4 vohunes), I advocated the complementarity 
between tile then dominant "puristic" approach to 
computational linguistics (represented, for example, in 
the Foreword of t lans Karlgren to the same Proceedings), 
focusing oil computation and on file derivation of results 
according to rules, and a more "pragmatic" approach, 
focusing on practical, applicable results and on the 
ability to process large collections of real linguistic data. 
In particular, I stressed tile need to promote corpus-based 
studies, statistical methods, robust morphosyntactic 
tuggers and parsers, adequate large machine dictionaries, 
cooperation with descriptive linguists, lexicographers, 
humanists using computers, etc. Today, particularly due 
to the pressing requests of the "language industry" sector 
for robust NLP components capable of dealing with real 
language uses, tile process of convergence between the 
two approaches is underway, and can be recognized as a 
major feature characterizing the present stage of 
development. 
Programmes and actions promoted by the major 
international nd national Funding Agencies have been 
of paramount importance in shaping the evolution of our 
field in this direction. The Commission of the European 
Communities began to promote large scale activities in 
natural language processing more or less around the time 
of the Bergen COLING Conference in 1978. I still 
rmnember the endless conversations and discussions 
taking place during the Conference cruise along the 
magnificent Norwegian fjords, stimulated by the 
rnmours that the Commission intended to launch 
programmes in machine translation and documentation. 
The role and influence of the Funding Agencies has, 
since then, dramatically increased. Furtbermore, to 
respond to the pressing needs of our multilingual society 
in producing, distributing, accessing, and retrieving 
inlormation encoded in natural anguage, international 
cooperation is crucial. Specifically, common policies, 
adequate linguistic infrastructures, standards for resources 
and product development must be established if we want 
an effective language technology and a real language 
industry. 
For these reasons, we felt it was appropriate oorganize, 
for the first time wthin COLING, a panel of tile 
representatives from European (CEC, EUREKA), 
American (DARPA, NSF) and Japanese Funding 
Agencies to discuss needs, priorities, policies, and 
perspectives, and to set up a session dedicated to the 
presentation f representative large-scale, publicly funded 
projects. The global amount of resonrces made available 
to natural language processing activities and the 
awareness of the stategic relevance of possible industrial 
applications has increased in the last few years. 
We have arrived at a very crucial stage: interest in our 
fiekl and the anticipation of wdid results are great. We 
must carefully evaluate he state-of-the-art in relatioa to 
the various tasks and applications, identify priorities in 
research and development, and seriously promote the 
integration of various approaches. We hope that this 
COLING will provide a significant contribution towards 
these goals.
