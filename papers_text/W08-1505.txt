Abstract
As? spoken? dialogue? systems? move? be?
yond?task?oriented?dialogues?and?become
distributed? in? the? pervasive? computing
environments,? their? growing? complexity
calls? for? more? modular? structures.? When
different? aspects? of? a? single? system? can
be? accessed? with? different? interfaces,
knowledge? representation? and? separation
of? low? level? interaction? modeling? from
high? level?reasoning?on?domain? level?be?
comes? important.? In? this? paper,? a? model
utilizing?a?dialogue?plan?to?communicate
information?from?domain?level?planner?to
dialogue?management?and?from?there?to?a
separate? mobile? interface? is? presented.
The? model? enables? each? part? of? the? sys?
tem? handle? the? same? information? from
their? own? perspectives? without? contain?
ing?overlapping?logic.
1 Introduction
Most? existing? spoken? dialogue? systems? pro?
vide? a? single? interface? to? solve? a? well?defined
task,? such? as? booking? tickets? or? providing? time?
table? information.?There?are? emerging?areas?that
differ? dramatically? from? task?oriented? systems.
In? domain?oriented? dialogues? (Dybkjaer? et? al,
2004)? the? interaction? with? the? system,? typically
modeled?as?a?conversation?with?a?virtual?human?
like?character,?can?be?the?main?motivation?for?the
interaction.?These?systems?are?often? multimodal,
and?may?take?place?in?pervasive?computing?envi?
ronments? where? various? mobile,? robotic,? and
other?untraditional? interface?are?used? to?commu?
nicate?with? the?system.?For?example,? in? the?EU?
funded? COMPANIONS?project? (Wilks,? 2007)
we? are? developing? a? conversational? Health? and
Fitness? Companion? that? develops? long?lasting
relationships? with? its? users? to? support? their
healthy? living? and? eating? habits? via? mobile? and
physical?agent?interfaces.?Such?systems?have?dif?
ferent? motivations? for? use? compared? to? tradi?
tional? task?based? spoken? dialogue? systems.? In?
stead?of?helping?with?a?single,?well?defined?task,
the?system?aims?at?building?a?long?term?relation?
ship? with? its? user? and? providing? support? on? a
daily?basis.
1.1 Mobile?and?Physical?Agent?Interfaces
New? kinds?of? interfaces? are?used? increasingly
often? in? conjunction? with? spoken? dialogue? tech?
nology.? Speech? suits? mobile? interfaces? well? be?
cause?it?can?overcome?the?limited? input?and?out?
put?modalities?of? the?small? devices?and?can?also
better? support? using? during? the? moments? when
their?hand?or?eyes?are?busy.?Physical?agent?inter?
faces,?on? the?other?hand,?have?been?used? in?sys?
tems,?which? try? to? make? dialogue?systems? more
part?of?people?s?life.?In?many?cases,?they?include
rich?multimodal?input?and?output?while?providing
a?physical?outlook?for?the?agent.?While?naturalis?
tic? human?like? physical? robots? are? under? devel?
opment,? especially? in? Japan,? there? is? room? for? a
variety? of? different? physical? interface? agents
ranging? from? completely? abstract? (e.g.,? simple
devices?with?lights?and?sound)?to?highly?sophisti?
cated? anthropomorphic? apparatus.? For? example,
Marti?and?Schmandt?(2005)?used?several?toy?ani?
mals,? such? as? bunnies? and? squirrels,? as? physical
embodied? agents? for? a? conversational? system.
Other?example?is?an?in?door?guidance?and?recep?
tionist? application? involving?a? physical? interface
agent? that? combines? pointing?gestures? with? con?
versational?speech?technology?(Kainulainen?et?al.,
2005).?Some?physical? agent? technology?has? also
24
been? commercialized.?For? example,? the? wireless
Nabaztag? /tag? rabbits
(http://www.nabaztag.com/)? have? been? success
and? an? active? user? community? has? emerged
around?it.
Both? mobile? use? and? physical? agent? interface
can? support? the? goal? of? making? a? spoken? dia?
logue? system? part? of? users?? everyday? life? and
building? a? meaningful? relationship? between? the
system?and?the?user.?It?has?been?found?that?mere
existence? of? a? physical? interface? changes? users?
attitude? toward?a? system?and? having?access? to? a
system?throughout?the?day?via?a?mobile?interface
is?likely?to?further?support?this?relationship.
In? this?work,?we?have?used? the?Nabaztag?as?a
multimodal?physical?interface?to?create?a?conver?
sational? Health? and? Fitness? Companion? and? a
mobile? version? interface? for? outdoor? usage? has
been?implemented?on?Windows?Mobile?platform.
1.2 Inter?component? Communication? and
Knowledge?Representation?Challenges
In? systems,? where? multiple? interfaces? can? be
used?to?access?parts?of?the?same?functionality?and
the?system?interacts?with?a?user?many?times?over
a? long? time?period,?modeling? the? interaction?and
domain? easily? becomes? complex.? For? example,
the?system?should?model?interaction?history?on?a
longer?timescale?than?a?single?session.?With?mul?
tiple? interfaces,? at? least? some? such? information
could?be?useful?if?they?can?be?shared?between?the
interfaces.?Furthermore,?the?system?must?include
a?model? capable?of? reasoning?about? the?domain,
and? learn?from?the?user?and?his?or?her?actions?to
provide? meaningful? interaction,? such? as? to? pro?
vide? reasonable? guidance? on? user?s? health? and
progress? as? the?user?s?condition?alters?over? time
in?our?case?with?the?Health?and?Fitness?Compan?
ion.? Such? reasoning? should? be? concentrated? on
one? component,? instead? of? duplicating? the? logic
to?keep?the?system?maintainable.?Still,? the? infor?
mation? must? be? communicated? over? different
interfaces?and?the?component?inside?them.?There?
fore,?modularization?of?the?system?and?appropri?
ate?knowledge?representation?become?vital.
On? dialogue? management? level,? a? common
way?to?take?some?complexity?away?from?the?dia?
logue? manager? and? limit? its? tasks? more? specifi?
cally? to? dialogue? management? is? to? separate?do?
main? specific? processing,? such? as? database? que?
ries,?into?a?back?end?component.?Many?research?
ers?have?worked?with?separating?generic?dialogue
management?processes?from?the?domain?specific
processes.? Example? solutions? include? shells
(J?nsson,? 1991)? and? object? oriented? program?
ming?methods?(Salonen,? et?al.,?2004,?O?Neill,?et
al.,?2003).?On?the?other?hand,?a?simple?back?end
interface,? e.g.,? SQL? queries,? can? be? included? as
configuration? parameters? (Pellon? et? al.,? 2000).
Since? dialogue? management? is? usually? based? on
state? transition? networks,? form? filling,? or? some
other? clearly? defined? model,? separating? domain
specific?processing?to?the?back?end?makes?it?pos?
sible? to? implemented? dialogue? management
purely?with?the?selected?model.
Health?and?Fitness?Companion,?as?discussed?in
the? following,? is? based? on? a? model? where? the
domain?specific? module? is?more?than?just?a?sim?
ple? interface? and? includes? active? processing? of
domain?information,?reasoning,?learning,?or?other
complex? processes.? We? call? such? a? component
the?cognitive?model.?While?the?task?of?a?dialogue
manager?is?to?maintain?and?update?dialogue?state,
the? cognitive? model? reasons? using? the? domain
level? knowledge.? In? our? case,? we? have? two? dia?
logue?managers,?one?for?the?home?system?with?a
physical? interface?agent?and?one?for?mobile?sys?
tem?(yet?another? is? in?development,?but?not?con?
sidered?here).?The?two?handle?somewhat?separate
tasks?but? each? provides? input? to? another? and? the
cognitive? model.? Separation?of? the? task?between
the? different? parts? is? not? trivial.? For? example,
managing? dialogue? level? phenomena,? such? as
error? handling? and? basic? input? processing,? are
tasks? clearly? in? the? areas? of? respective? dialogue
managers.?However,?cognitive?modeling?can?help
in? error? handling? by? spotting? input? that? seems
suspicious? based? on? domain? level? information
and? input? parsing? by? providing? information? on
potential?discussion?topics.?The?solution?we?have
devised?is?to?have?the?cognitive?model?produce?a
dialogue? plan? for? the? dialogue? management? in
home? system.? The? dialogue? management? in? the
home? system? provides? parsed? user? inputs? to? the
cognitive? model? and? to? the? mobile? system.? The
mobile?system?provides?similar?input?back?to?the
home?system,?which?communicates?it?back?to?the
cognitive?model.
In? the? following? we? describe? the? Health? and
Fitness?dialogue?system?in?general.?Then?we?dis?
cuss? the? mobile? interface,? the? dialogue? manager
of?the?home?system?and?the?cognitive?model,?be?
fore? going? into? details? on? how? the? components
have? been? separated.? The? solution,? which? pro?
vides? great? flexibility? for? each,? is? discussed? be?
fore?conclusions.

2 Health?and?Fitness?Companion
The?Health?and?Fitness?Companion?(H&F)?is?a
conversational? interface? for? supporting? healthy
lifestyle.?The?companion?plans?each?day?together
with? its? user? at? home,? and? suggests? healthy? ac?
tivities,?such?as?walking?to?work,?when?possible.
During? the? day,? a? mobile? interface? to? the? Com?
panion? can? be? used? to? record? various? physical
activities,? such? as? those? walks? to? work.? After?
wards,?the?user?is?able?to?report?back?to?the?com?
panion?on?the?day,?and?get?more?advice?and?sup?
port.? At? this? point? information? recorded? by? the
mobile? system? is? automatically?used?by? the? sys?
tem.

As? seen? in? Figure? 1,? H&F? home? system? uses? a
Nabaztag/tag? WLAN? rabbit? as? a? physical? inter?

to?talk?input,?and?is?able?to?move?its?ears?and?op?
erate? four? colored? lights? to? signal,? for? example,

help?users?associate? the? two? interfaces.?The? mo?
bile? Companion? follows? the? user? for? physical
activities,? such? as? jogging,? and? collects? data? on
the? exercises? and? feeds? this? back? into? the? main
system.? While? it? includes? a? multimodal? speech
interface,?the?main?input?modality?for?the?mobile

From?technical?viewpoint,?H&F?is?a?multimo?
dal? spoken? dialogue? system? containing? compo?
nents? for? speech? recognition? (ASR),?natural? lan?
guage? understanding? (NLU),? dialogue? manage?
ment? (DM),? natural? language?generation? (NLG),
and? speech? synthesis? (TTS).? Furthermore,? it? in?
cludes? a? separate? cognitive? model? (CM),? which
works? in? close? co?operation? with? DM? of? the
home? system,? as?presented? in? the? following? sec?
tions.?The?dialogue?system?in?the?home?system?is
implemented? using? Java? and? Jaspis? framework
(Turunen? et? al.,? 2005)? with? jNabServer
(http://www.cs.uta.fi/hci/spi/jnabserver/)? for? Na?

plemented? in?Lisp?and? integrated? into? the? Jaspis
framework.?The?mobile?interface?is?implemented

For? speech? recognition? and? synthesis,? H&F
uses? Loquendo? ASR?and? TTS.? Current? recogni?
tion? grammars? for? the? home? system,? derived
from? a? WOZ? data? and? extended? using? user? test
data,?have?a?vocabulary?of?1090?words?and?a?to?
tal?of?436?grammar?rules.?Recognition?grammars
are? dynamically? selected? for? each? user? input,
based?on?the?dialogue?state.?The?mobile?interface
use? mobile? versions? of? Loquendo? technology.
Due? to? the? technological? limitations,? more? chal?
lenging?acoustic? environment,? potential?physical
exhaustion?of?users,?and?more?restricted?domain,
the?recognition?grammars?in?the?mobile?interface
will? remain? significantly? smaller? than? those? of
the?home?system.
NLU? is? based? on? SISR? semantic? tags
(http://www.w3.org/TR/semantic?interpretation/)
embedded? in? the? recognition? grammars.? In? the
home?system,? where? mixed? initiative? interaction
is?possible,? the?tags?provide?parameters?compati?
ble?with?predicates?used?to?represent?information
on?the?dialogue?management?level.?Input?parsing
unifies? these? parameters? into? full? predicates
based? on? the? current? dialogue? state.? In? mobile
system,? more? strict? state? based? dialogue? model?
ing? can? results? in? unambiguous? output? straight

Natural? language? generation? is? a? mixture? of
canned?strings?and,? in? the?home?system,? tree?ad?
joining? grammar? based? generation.? In? addition,
control? messages? for? Nabaztag? ears? and? lights
can?be?generated.
As? discussed? previously,? distribution? and? co?
ordination? of? the? different? tasks? between? differ?
ent? components? can? become? rather? complex? in
systems? such? as? H&F? without? proper? modeling
of? interaction,? domain,? and? reasoning? compo?
nents.? Next,? we? present? a? model? which? allows
flexible? interaction?between? the? cognitive? model
and?the?dialogue?management.
3 Dialogue? Management? and? Cognitive
Modeling
There?is?great?consensus?that?components?of?a
dialogue? system? can? be? split? into? at? least? three
parts:?an?input?module,?which?receives?user?input
and?parses? it? into? a? logical? form,?dialogue? man?
agement,? which? maintains? and? updates? dialogue
state? based? on? user? input? and? generates? output
requests,?and?an?output?module,?which?generates
natural? language?output? to?user? based?on? the? re?
quests.? In? the? case? of? H&F,? we? have? also? sepa?
rated? a? cognitive? model? (CM)? from? dialogue
manager?(DM),?as?seen?in?Figure?3.?We?call?this
module? the? cognitive? model,? because? it? contains
what? can? be? considered? higher? level? cognitive
processes?of?the?system.?Next,?we?present?DM?of
the? home? system,? CM? component,? and? the? mo?
bile?interface,?focusing?on?their?interaction.
Figure?3:?Information?passed?between?the
components.
3.1 Cognitive?Model?Responsibilities
The? task? of? CM? is? to? model? the? domain,? i.e.,
know? what? to? recommend? to? the? user,? what? to
ask? from? the?user? and? what?kind? of? feedback? to
provide.?CM? in?H&F?uses?hierarchical? task?net?
works? (HTNs)? (Cavazza? et? al.,? 2008)? as? the
method?of?planning?healthy?daily?activity?for? the
user.?Part? of? a?network?can?be? seen? in?Figure?4.
In?the?current?H&F?implementation,?the?planning
domain?included?16?axioms?and?111?methods,?49
operators,?42?semantic?tags,?113?evaluation?rules
and? there? are?17?different? topics? to?be?discussed
with?the?user.

CM? is? aware? of? the? meaning? of? the? concepts
inside? the? system? on? a? domain? specific? level.? It
generates?and?updates?a?dialogue?plan?according
to? the? information? received? from? the? user.? The
plan?is?forwarded?to?DM.?Interaction?level?issues
are?not?directly?visible?to?CM.
27
3.2 Dialogue?Management?in?the?Home?Sys?
tem
The? task? of? DM? is? to? maintain? and? update? a
dialogue? state.? In? the?H&F?system,? the? dialogue
state? includes? a? dialogue? history? tree? (currently
linear),?a?stack?of?active?dialogue?topics,?and?cur?
rent?user?input,?including?ASR?confidence?scores
and?N?best? lists.? In? addition,? two?pools?of? items
that? need? to? be? confirmed? are? stored;? one? for
items? to? be? confirmed? individually? and? another
for? those? that? can? be? confirmed? together? in? one
question.
DM? receives? user? inputs? as? predicates? parsed
by? the? NLU? component.? If? an? utterance? is? suc?
cessfully? parsed? and? matches? the? current? dia?
logue?plan? (see?Section?3.3),? DM?does? not? need
to?know?what?the?meaning?of?the?input?actually?is.
It? just? takes? care? of? confirmations? and? provides
the? information? to?CM.? When? generating? output
requests?based?on? the?plan,?DM?can?also?be?un?
aware?of? the?specific?meaning?of? the?plan? items.
Overall,?DM?does?not?need?to?have?the?deep?do?
main?understanding?CM?specializes?in.
DM,?however,? is?aware?of? the?relations?of? the
predicates? on? the? topics? level,? i.e.,? it? knows,
which? predicates? belong? to? each? topic.? This? in?
formation? is? used? primarily? for? parsing? input.
DM? also? has? understanding? of? the? semantics? of
the? predicates? which? relates? to? interaction.
Namely,? relations? such? as? question? ?? answer
pairs? (suggestion? ?? agreement,? confirmation? ?
acceptance/rejection,?etc.)?are?modeled.
On? implementation? level,? dialogue? manage?
ment? is? implemented? as? a? collection? of? separate
small?dialogue?agents,?following?the?principles?of
the? underlying? Jaspis? architecture.? These? agents
are?small?software?components,?each?taking?care
of? a? specific? task?and? in? each?dialogue? turn? one
or? more? agents? are? selected? by? DM.? In? the? cur?
rent? H&F? prototype,? there? are? over? 30? dialogue
agents.? There? is? a? separate? agent? for? each? topic
that?can?occur? in? the?plan.? In?practice,?one? topic
maps? to? a? single?plan? item.?These? agents? are? all
instances?of?a?single?class?with?specific?configu?
rations.?Each?agent?handles? all? situations? related
to?its?topic;?when?the?topic?is?the?first?item?of?an
active? plan,? they? produce? related? output? and
when? the? user? provides? input? matching? to? the
topic? they? forward? that? information? back? to? the
cognitive? model.? In? addition,? topic? specific
agents?handle?explicit?topic?switch?requests?from
the? user? (e.g.,??let?s? talk? about? lunch?)? and? also
take? turn? if? the? topic? is? found?on? top?of? the?dia?
logue? topic? stack.? A? topic? ends? up? in? the? stack
when?it?has?not?been?finished?and?a?new?topic?is
activated.? The? other? agents? found? in? the? system
include? one? that? generates? a? confirmation? if? the
ASR? confidence? score? is? too? low,? one? that? re?
peats?the? last?system?utterance?when?the?user?re?
quests? it? (?please? repeat? the? last? one?),? and? an
agent?to?handle?ASR?rejection?errors.
3.3 Mobile?System
Mobile?system?is?designed?mainly?to?support?us?
ers??on?their?physical?exercises?and?collected?data
on?them?fro?the?home?system.?The?mobile?system
receives?the?day?plan?that?the?user?has?made?with
the?home?system?and?it?is?used?as?basis?when?us?
ers?activates?the?system.?This?way,?the?user?does
not?need?to?re?enter?information?such?as?the?type
of? an? exercise.? This? is? possible,? however,? with
simple?spoken?dialogue?or?by?using?the?graphical
user?interface.?During?the?exercise,?GPS?informa?
tion?is?used?by?the?system?to?provide?feedback?on
pace? to? the? user? using? speech? output.? For? dia?
logue? management,? the? mobile? system? uses? a
state?based? model,? based? on? scripting.? Since? the
mobile?system?focuses?on?the?physical?exercises,
it? is? aware? of? the? meaning? of? the? predicates? it
receives?on? that? level.? It?knows?more?about?run?
ning?and?walking? than?any?other? component.?At
the?same?time,? it? ignores?most?of? the?day?plan? it
receives.? For? example,? eating? related? plan? items
are?not?relevant?to?the?mobile?system?in?any?way
and?are?ignored?(however,?in?the?future?we?could
include?the?possibility?to?report?on?meals?as?well).
3.4 Dialogue?Plan?and?Day?Plan
The? communication? between? the? dialogue
managers? and? CM? is? based? on? a? dialogue? plan
and?a?day?plan.?Various?kinds?of? dialogue?plans
(Larsson? et? al.,? 2000,? Jullien? and? Marty,? 1989)
have?been?used? inside? dialogue? managers? in? the
past.?A?plan?usually?models?what?the?system?sees
as?the?optimal?route?to?task?completion.
In?H&F,?CM?provides?a?plan?on?how?the?cur?
rent? task? (planning? a? day,? reporting? on? a? day)
could?proceed.?The?plan?consists?of?items,?which
are? basically? expressions? on? domain? specific
propositional? logic.? Example? 1? contains? two
items? from? the? start? of? a? plan? for? planning? the
day? with? the?user? in? the? morning.? The? first? plan
item? (QUERY?PLANNED?ACTIVITY)? can? be
realized? as? the? question? ?Anything? interesting
planned?for?today???by?the?system.
As? new? information? becomes? available? (from
the?user),?it?forms?a?plan?for?the?day?or?a?report?of
the? day.? DM? provides? this? information? to? CM,
28
piece? by? piece? as? it? becomes? available.? At? the
same? time,? the? information? is? uploaded? into? a
web? server,? where? the? mobile? interface? can? ac?
cess?it?anytime.
As?CM?receives?the?information,?it?updates?the
dialogue? plan? as? necessary.? Query? type? items,
whose? information? has?been? gathered,?disappear
from?the?plan?and?new?items?may?appear.
The?messages? sent? to?CM?can?add?new? infor?
mation? (predicates)? to? CM? state.? DM? can? also
remove? information? from? CM? if? previously? en?
tered?information?is?found?to?be?untrue.?Similarly,
information?uploaded? to? the? web? server? for? mo?
bile? use? can? be? modified.? The? information? in?
cludes? statements? on? user?s? condition? (tired),
user?s? commitments? to? the? system? (will? walk? to
work),? user?s? preferences? (does? not? like? cafete?
rias)? and? user?s? reports? on? past? activity? (took? a
taxi? to?work),?which?can?be?accomplishments?or
failures?of?earlier?commitments.

DM? in? the? home? system? can? follow? the? dia?
logue? plan? produced? by? CM? step? by? step.? Each
step? usually? maps? to? a? single? question,? but? can
naturally?result? in?a?longer?dialogue? if? the?user?s
answer? is? ambiguous? or? error? management? is
necessary,?or?if?DM?decides?to?split?a?single?item
to?multiple?questions.?For?example,? the?two?dia?
logue? turn?pairs?seen? in? example?2?are? the?result
of? a? single? plan? item? (QUERY?PLANNED?
ACTIVITY).? Since? the? first? user? utterance? does
not?result?in?a?complete,?unambiguous?predicate,
DM? asks? a? clarification? question.? A? single? user
utterance? can? also? result? in? multiple? predicates
(e.g.,? will? not? take? bus,? has? preference? to? walk?
ing).
When? the? mobile? interface? is? activated,? it
downloads? the? current? day? plan? from? the? web
server? and? uses? it? as? a? basis? for? the? dialogue? it
has? with? the? user.?The? exercise? which? will? then
take? place? can? be? linked? to? an? item? in? the? day
plan,?or?it?can?be?something?new.?As?the?exercise
is? completed? (or? aborted),? information? in? this? is
uploaded? to? the?web?server.?From? there? the?DM
of? the?home?system?can?download? it.?This? infor?
mation? is? relevant? to? the? DM? when? the? user? is
reporting?on?a?day.?The?home?system?downloads
the? information? provided? by? the? mobile? system
and?reports?it?back?to?CM?when?the?dialogue?plan
includes? a? related? item.? DM? may? also? provide
some?feedback?to?the?user?based?on?the?informa?
tion.? It? is? noteworthy,? that?CM?does?not?need? to
differentiate?in?any?way,?whether?the?information
on? the? exercise?came? from?the?mobile?system?or
was?gathered?in?a?dialogue?with?the?home?system.

which?is?forwarded?to?the?cognitive?model?and
the?mobile?interface.
Similarly,? clarifications? and?confirmations? are
not? directly? visible? to? CM.? DM? can? confirm
items? immediately? (for? example,? when? low?con?
fidence? is?reported?by?the?NLG?component)?or?it
can?delay?confirmations?to?generate?a?single?con?
29
firmation? for? multiple? items? at? an? appropriate
moment.
Most? importantly,? when? presenting? questions
and?suggestions?to?the?user,?DM?is?free?to?choose
any? item? in? the? plan,? or? even? do? something? not
included? in? the? plan? at? all.? When? information
from?the?mobile?system?is?available,?it?can?direct
where?we?start?the?dialogue?from.?DM?could?also
decide? to? do? some? small?talk? to? introduce?sensi?
tive?topics,?which?can?be?useful?in?managing?the
user?system? relationship? (Bickmore? and? Picard,
2005).?In?the?future,?we?see?DM?to?have?various
kinds?of?knowledge?on?the?dialogue?topics:?it?can
know?how?personal?these?topics?are?and?how?top?
ics? are? related? to? each? other.? It? may? also? have
some?topics?of?its?own.?The?communication? that
is?not?related?to?the?domain?does?not?reach?CM?at
any?point.
CM? can? include? additional? annotation? in? the
plan.?One?such?example?is?the? importance?of?the
information.? If? information? is?marked? important,
it? is? likely,?but?not? certain,? that?DM? will? explic?
itly? confirm? it.? It? is? also?possible? for?CM? to? ex?
plicitly? request? a? confirmation? by? generating? a
separate?plan?item.?For?example,?if?a?user?reports
on?having?run?much?more?than?they?are?likely?to
be?capable?of?in?their?condition,?CM?can?generate
a?confirmation?plan?item.?It? is?worth?noting,?that
DM?cannot?do?reasoning?on?such?level?and?there?
fore? CM? must? participate? in? error? handling? in
such?cases.
3.5 Benefits?of?the?Model
The? presented? model? for? interoperability? be?
tween? the? mobile? system,? the? DM? of? the? home
system?and?CM?has?provided?great?flexibility?for
each?component.?While?the?dialogue?plan?gener?
ated? by? CM? provides? a? base? for? dialogue? man?
agement,?which,? in?most?cases,? is? followed,?DM
can? deviate? from? it.? DM? can? handle? confirma?
tions?as?it?pleases,?add?small?talk,?and?process?the
plan?items?in?any?order.?The?model?also?supports
mixed?initiative? dialogues;? while? DM? may? fol?
low? the?plan,? the?user?may?discuss? any? topic.? In
our? current? implementation,? user? input? is?parsed
first? against? the? previous? system? output,? next? to
the? current? topic,? and? finally? to? the? entire? space
of? known? predicates.? If? needed,? we? can? also
make? parsing? more? detailed? by? parsing? against
dialogue?history? and? the?current?plan.?This?way,
the?information?produced?by?CM?is?used?in?input
parsing.? The? dialogue? plan? can? be? used? in? dy?
namic? construction? of? recognition? grammars? to
support?this?on?ASR?grammar?level.
Most? importantly,? all? this? is? possible? without
including? domain? specific? knowledge.? All? such
information? is? kept? exclusive? in? CM.? Similarly,
CM? does?not? need? to?know? the? interaction? level
properties? of? the? topics,? such? as? recognition
grammars? and? natural? language? generation? de?
tails.?These? are? internal? to? their? specific? compo?
nents.?The? mobile? system?uses? the? same? knowl?
edge? representation? as? CM,? but? CM? does? not
need?to?be?aware?of?its?existence?at?all.?Similarly,
the?mobile?system?can?use?any?part?of? the? infor?
mation? it? receives,? but? is? not? forced? to? do? any?
thing? specific.? DM? just? feed? all? the? information
to? it?and? lets? it? decide? what? to?do?with? it.?When
the? mobile? system? provides? information? back? to
the?home? system,?DM?handles? this? and?CM?can
ignore?completely? the?fact? that?different?parts?of
the? information? it? receives?were?generated?using
different? systems.? Similarly,? the? mobile? system
does?not?see?any?of?the?internals?of?the?home?sys?
tem.
On? an? implementation? level,? the? model? is? in?
dependent?of?the?mechanics?of?either?DM?or?CM.
DM? can? be? implemented? using? state? transition
networks?(a?network?per?plan?item),?forms?(form
per? item),?agent?based?model,? like? in? the?case?of
mobile? system,? or? any? other? suitable? method.
Similarly,? the? plan? does? not? tie? CM? to? any? spe?
cific?implementation.
4 Conclusions
When? dialogue? systems? move?beyond? limited
task? based? domains? and? implement? multimodal
interfaces? in? pervasive? computing? environment,
their? complexity? increases? rapidly.? Dialogue
management,? which? in? most? cases? is? handled
with?well?understood?methods?such?as? form?fill?
ing? or? state? transition? networks,? tends? to? grow
more?complex.?Therefore,?a?model?to?modularize
dialogue? management? and? domain? reasoning? is
needed.? At? the? same? time,? distributed? systems
required? various? kinds? of? information? to? be
communicated?with?components?and?systems.
While? traditional? spoken? dialogue? systems
have? been? task?based,? the? Health? and? Fitness
Companions?are?part?of?the?users??life?for?a?long
time,? months,? or? even? years.? This? requires? that
they? are? part? of? life? physically,? i.e.,? interactions
can? take? place? on? mobile? setting? and? in? home
environment? outside? of? traditional,? task?based
computing? devices.? With? the? physical? presence
of?the?interface?agent?and?spoken,?conversational
dialogue? we? aim? at? building? social,? emotional
relationships?between?the?users?and?the?Compan?
30
ion.?Such?relationships?should?help?us?in?motivat?
ing?the?users?towards?healthier?lifestyle.?The?mo?
bility? of? the? interface? integrates? the? system? into
the?physical?activities?they?aim?at?supporting?us?
ers?in.
We? have? presented? a? model,? which? separates
cognitive? modeling? from? dialogue? management
and?enables?flexible?interoperability?between? the
two?and?also?enables?sharing?the?gathered?knowl?
edge? to? the? mobile?part? of? the? system?and?back.
This? division,? while? similar? to? separation? of? a
back?end? from? dialogue? management,? draws? the
line? deeper? into? the? area? of? interaction? manage?
ment.? The? cognitive? model? processes? domain
level? information? and? generates? dialogue? plans.
The? dialogue? manager? focuses? only? on? interac?
tion?level?phenomena,?such?as?initiative?and?error
management,? and?other? meta?communication.? In
order?to?enable?flexible?interaction,?the?plan?pro?
vides? a? potential? structure? for? the? dialogue,? but
the?dialogue? manager? is? free? to?handle? things? in
different? order,? and? even? add? new? topics.? It? can
also?include?input?from?a?mobile?interface?of?the
system?without?making?this?explicit?to?the?cogni?
tive? model.? One? example? of? flexibility? is? error
management;?while? the?actual?error?correction? is
the? task? of? the? dialogue? manager,? domain? level
knowledge?can?reveal? errors.?Using?the?dialogue
plan,? the? cognitive? model? can? provide? such? in?
formation? to? the? dialogue? manager? without
knowledge? on? details?of? error? management.?The
model? also? enables? user? initiative? topic? shifts,
management? of? user?system? relationship? and
other? novel? issues? relevant? in? domain?oriented
dialogue?systems.
Overall,? the? model? presented? has? enabled? a
clear?division?and?interoperability?of?the?different
components?handling?separate?parts?of? the? inter?
action.? The? presented? model? has? been? imple?
mented? in? the? Health? and? Fitness? Companion

the?dialogue?manager,?and?the?mobile?interface?to
be? developed? in? parallel? by? different? groups? us?
