Abstract 
The same word can have many different mean- 
ings depending on the context in which it is 
used. Discovering the meaning of a word, given 
the text around it, has been an interesting prob- 
lem for both the psychology and the artificial 
intelligence research communities. In this arti- 
cle, we present a series of experiments, using 
methods which have proven to be useful for 
eliminating part-of-speech ambiguity, to see if 
such simple methods can be used to resolve se- 
mantic ambiguities. Using a publicly available 
semantic lexicon, we find the Hidden Markov 
Models work surprising well at choosing the 
right semantic ategories, once the sentence has 
been stripped of purely functional words. 
1 Introduction 
Any natural language processing system treating any- 
thing beyond the most restricted omains is confronted 
with the problem of distinguishing between uses of 
polysemous words. The idea behind semantically tag- 
ging words is that sense markings added to words may 
be used by some automatic process in order to choose 
the proper senses of words in a given context. For exam- 
ple, the word bark would receive at least two possible 
semantic tags and these tags along with the tags of other 
words in the surrounding context would allow the proc- 
ess to distinguish between the senses the bark of a tree, 
and the bark of a dog. (See \[Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale 
et al, 1992a; Gale et al 1992b; Ng and Lee, 1996; 
Wilks, 1996; Yarowski, 1992; Yarowski, 1995\] for re- 
cent work on word sense disambiguation). 
Semantic tagging is considered to be a much more dif- 
ficult task than part-of-speech tagging. Despite this 
current hinking, we decided to perform an experiment 
to see how well words can be semantically disambigu- 
ated using techniques that have proven to be effective in 
part-of-speech tagging. We decided to use the 45 se- 
mantic tags available through the WordNet package. In 
this typology, the word bark has two a priori semantic 
tags: bark as a "'covering, natural covering, cover" re- 
ceives tag 20 (nouns denoting plants); and bark as 
"'noise, cry" has tag 11 (nouns denoting natural events). 
This semantic tagset has two advantages: it is a reason- 
able size, so that statistical techniques that we are testing 
do not need an inordinate amount of training data; and 
secondly, a semantically tagged corpus is available that 
we can use for testing. 
2 WordNet Semantic tags 
Part-of-speech tagging is better understood than seman- 
tic tagging. For one thing, no consensus on semantic tags 
exists, contrary to the general consensus on the higher 
level part-of-speech tags. And it seems more likely that 
syntactic tags be generalizable over wider textual do- 
mains than semantic ones. 
Despite this, the WordNet eam has taken upon them- 
selves to create a general semantic tagging scheme and 
to apply it on a large scale: every set of synonymous 
senses, synsets, are tagged with one of 45 tags as Word- 
Net version 1.5 ~. In their schema, there are3 tags for 
adjectives (relational adjectives, participial adjectives 
and all others), 1 tag for all adverbs, 26 tags for nouns 
(act, animal, man-made artifact, attributes, body parts, 
.... substance, and time), and 15 tags for verbs (from 
grooming and dressing verbs, to verbs of weather). 
These tags are assigned for the most general uses of 
words. For example, the noun blood is tagged as 07 (an 
attribute of people and objects), as 08 (body part) and as 
14 (groupings of people and objects). Blood is not 
tagged as 27 (substance) or as 13 (food), though it might 
well be considered as such in certain contexts.

3 HMM Tagging 
We wanted to see how well these WordNet semantic tags 
could be disambiguated using the same well-understood 
techniques employed in statistical part-of-speech disam- 
biguation. Part-of-speech disambiguation relies on the 
fact that certain sequences of parts of speech are more 
probable than others. Often, this probability is estimated 
from the frequency of sequences of tags in hand tagged 
texts. 
In our experiments, we used the Hidden Markov 
Model (HMM) tagging method escribed in \[Cutting et 
aL, 1992\]. In this method, the probability of seeing a 
given tag depends on the ambiguity class of the word 
and on the ambiguity class of the words preceding it. An 
ambigmty class of a word is the set of words which each 
have exactly the same set of ambiguous tags. This class 
is used during the Xerox HMM tagging in place of more 
specific lexical (= word-based) probabilities. Lexical 
probabilities would more accurately inform the tagger 
with the frequency with which a certain word receives a 
certain tag, but acquiring this frequency requires much 
greater amounts of tagged text than is necessary with the 
ambiguity class method. The HMM training and tagging 
programs in our experiment \[Wilkens and Kupiec, 1995\] 
are based on bigrams, i.e. only the immediate context of 
a word is taken into account. 
The use of this statistical disambiguation combines with 
the advantage of the limited number of WordNet ags so 
that training can be performed on a relatively small cor- 
pus. 
4 Data Preparation and Tagger Train- 
ing 
In order to make a HMM for semantic tags we per- 
formed the following steps: 
1. We derived a lexicon from the WordNet data files 
which contains all possible semantic tags for each noun, 
adjective, adverb and verb. Words having no semantic 
tags (determiners, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc.) are 
assigned their part of speech tags. 
2. With version 1.5 of WordNet is delivered about 
one-fifth of the Brown corpus which has been semanti- 
cally tagged by the WordNet team. From these 11,182 
sentences, we constructed a traming corpus and a test 
corpus of equal size, taking all even numbered sentences 
for the training corpus and all odd-numbered sentences 
for the test corpus. From both corpora, in order to use 
"'semantically relevant" tokens for the HMM bigrams, 
we retained all nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives and 
deleted all function words except prepositions, commas, 
final stops, personal pronouns and interrogative adverbs. 
3. We computed a HMM model based on the training 
corpus, ran the resulting semantic tagger on an untagged 
version of test corpus and we compared the tags as- 
signed by the semantic tagger to original tags in the test 
corpus. 
5 Tagging Results 
5.1 Test 1 
As described above, the semantically tagged text pro- 
vided by WordNet (CO) was transformed into a training 
corpus (C 1). 
(co) The/DT Fulton_County_Grand_Jury/03

irregularities/04 took place/30 ./. 
The lexicon used for this experiment contains 3,282 
different ambiguity classes made of 52 semantic tags 
(45 WordNet tags + 6 pan-of-speech tags + 1 tag for 
non-lexicalized word-forms). 
The training corpus consists of 75,000 tokens and 
covers about 72% of all possible ambiguity classes. The 
test corpus contains 90,000 tokens. 46% of the words are 
ambiguous, i.e. the lexicon provides at least two (and at 
most 15) different semantic tags for these words. 
For the test corpus the overall accuracy was of 86% 
and the accuracy over ambiguous tokens of 71% cor- 
rectly chosen WordNet semantic tags. 
5.2 Test 2 
In fact, the first experiment combined syntactic and 
semantic tagging, as the WordNet ags are classified by 
part-of-speech categories. 
Thus we run a second experiment which applies se- 
mantic tagging after part-of-speech tagging. We simu- 
lated the part-of-speech tagging step by adding a syntac- 
tic category to the training and test corpus: 
(C3) FFulton_County_Grand_Jury=NOUN / 03 
79 
said=VERB/32 Friday=NOUN/28 
mvestlgation/09 of/IN Atlanta=NOUN/15 
recent=ADJ/00 primary_election=NOUN / 04
produced=VERB/39 evidence=NOUN/09 
that/IN irregularities=NOUN / 04 
tookplace=VERB/30 ./. 
We modified the lexicon accordingly. For example, a
single lexicon entry for bark was divided into two en- 
tries for the verb and for the noun reading: 
(LI) bark {06, 11, 20, 30, 32, 35} 
(L2} bark=VERB {30, 32, 35} 
bark=NOUN {06, 11, 20}. 
Using part-of-speech pre-tagging, the number of am- 
biguity classes decreases (1685) and only 27% of the 
word forms in the test corpus are ambiguous. 
With this method, the accuracy over the entire text is 
of 89%. This improvement is mainly due to the lower 
overall ambiguity rate: part-of-speech pre-tagging solved 
the "'semantic" ambiguity for 40% of the ambiguous 
words in Test 1. The error rate for those words which 
remain ambiguous after part-of-speech disambiguation is 
almost identical (71% correctly chosen tags) for both 
test cases. 
5.3 Test 3 
For the part-of-speech tagging problem, it is known that 
assigning the most common part of speech for each lexi- 
cal item gives a baseline of 90% accuracy \[Brill, 1992\]. 
In order to see what a similar baseline is for semantic 
tagging over part-of-speech tagged text, we performed 
the following experiment. From the training corpus, we 
calculated the most frequent semantic tag for each part- 
of-speech tagged lemma 2. On the test corpus, we as- 
signed the most frequent semantic tag to each known 
word, and for unknown nouns, verbs, adverbs, and ad- 
jectives, we assigned the most common semantic tag per 
part-of-speech. Capitalized unknown nouns were as- 
signed the S03 tag. Non-semantically tagged words were 
considered correctly tagged. The result of this tagging 
resulted in a baseline of 81% of correctly chosen seman- 
tic tags over all words, worse than the two preceding 
tests. 
6 D iscuss ion  and Conc lus ion  
We found it surprising that the same statistical tech- 
niques that improve part-of-speech tag disambiguation 
from a baseline of 90% to 95-96% work almost as well 
with semantic tags once function words are removed 
from the text to be tagged. The HMM technique im- 
proved the baseline 81% to 89% correctly chosen se-

mantic tags. 
mantic tags. These experiments show renewed promise 
for a statistical approach to the problem of sense disam- 
biguation, with a relatively small training set. 
Future plans include analyzing the kind of errors we 
get, to classify them. Starting from this classification we 
hope to be able to answer the following questions: what 
type of semantic tags should be used, should a non- 
binary HMM be used, and how much ambiguity can be 
resolved using local clues. 
We also plan to consider easonable applications for 
semantic tagging. One possibility would be to use se- 
mantic tagging in the framework of an intelligent on line 
dictionary lookup such as LocoLex \[Bauer et al 1995\]. 
LocoLex is a tool that has been developed at RXRC and 
which looks up a word in a bilingual dictionary taking 
the syntactic ontext into account. For instance, in a 
sentence such as They like to swzm the part of speech 
tagger in LocoLex determines that hke is a verb and not 
a preposition. Accordingly, the dictionary lookup com- 
ponent provides the user with the translation for the verb 
only. LocoLex also detects multi-word expressions 3. For 
instance, when stuck appears in the sentence my own 
parents tuck together the translation displayed after the 
user clicks on stuck is the one for the whole phrase sttck 
together and not only for the word stick. 
Currently LocoLex is purely syntactic and cannot dis- 
tinguish between the different meanings of a noun like 
bark. If, in addition to the current syntactic tags, we had 
access to the semantic tags provided by WordNet for this 
word (natural event and plants) and we were able to 
include this label in the online dictionary, this would 
improve the bilingual dictionary access of Locolex even 
further. 
Current bilingual dictionaries often include some se- 
mantic marking. For instance, in the OUP-Hachette 
English French dictionary, under bark we find the label 
Bot(anical) attached to one meaning and the collocator 
(of dog) associated with the other one. It is possible that 
some type of automated matching between these indica- 
tions and the WordNet semantic tags 4would allow the 
integration of a semantic tagger into LocoLex. 
Using only existing dictionary labels might still not be 
completely satisfying for machine translation. Indeed 
looking back at the example my own parents stuck to- 
gether even if we retrieved the multi-word expression 
meaning it will be difficult o decide which translation to 
choose with existing dictionary indications s. 
3 Multi-words expressions i clude ldtomattc expression (to 
sweep something under the rug), phrasal verbs (to spa up), or 
compounds (warmng hght) 
4 Or some other derwed tag set. 
5 Especially considering that WordNet provides only two 
senses of stick together $35 and $41. 
80 
For instance for stzck together the Oxford-Hachette 
English French dictionary gives: 
stick together 
1. (become fixed to each other) 
(pages) se coller 
2. (CoU) (remain loyal~ 
se serrer les coudes (Faro) 6tre sohdalre 
3. (Coil) (not separate) 
rester ensemble 
It appears clearly that using general dictionary labels 
would not be enough to choose the third meaning only. 
We would need to investigate further how to make better 
use of dictionary information such as collocators, etc. 
Another interesting application we would like to ex- 
amine is how useful semantic tagging could be in deter- 
mining the genre or topic of a text. Here, an initial idea 
would be to just count the number of occurrence of a 
given semantic tag and from this to determine the topic 
or the genre of a given text. This could be useful in ma- 
chine translation system to help, for instance, in choos- 
ing the appropriate l xicon (containing the specific ter- 
minology). Assuming that such dictionaries are less 
ambiguous, this could in return, improve the accuracy of 
the lexical semantic hoice in automatic translation.
