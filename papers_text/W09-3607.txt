Abstract 
We introduce the ACL Anthology Net-
work (AAN), a manually curated net-
worked database of citations, 
collaborations, and summaries in the field 
of Computational Linguistics. We also 
present a number of statistics about the 
network including the most cited authors, 
the most central collaborators, as well as 
network statistics about the paper citation, 
author citation, and author collaboration 
networks. 
1 Introduction 
The ACL Anthology is one of the most 
successful initiatives of the ACL. It was in-
itiated by Steven Bird and is now maintained 
by Min Yen Kan. It includes all papers pub-
lished by ACL and related organizations as 
well as the Computational Linguistics journal 
over a period of four decades. It is available 
at http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/ .  
One fundamental problem with the ACL 
Anthology, however, is the fact that it is just 
a collection of papers. It doesn?t include any 
citation information or any statistics about the 
productivity of the various researchers who 
contributed papers to it. We embarked on an 
ambitious initiative to manually annotate the 
entire Anthology in order to make it possible 
to compute such statistics.  
In addition, we were able to use the anno-
tated data for extracting citation summaries of 
all papers in the collection and we also anno-
tated each paper by the gender of the authors 
(and are currently in the process of doing si-
milarly for their institutions) in the goal of 
creating multiple gold standard data sets for 
training automated systems for performing 
such tasks.  
2 Curation 
The ACL Anthology includes 13,739 pa-
pers (excluding book reviews and posters). 
Each of the papers was converted from pdf to 
text using an OCR tool (www.pdfbox.org). 
After this conversion, we extracted the refer-
ences semi-automatically using string match-
ing. The above process outputs all the 
references as a single block so we then ma-
nually inserted line breaks between refer-
ences. These references were then manually 
matched to other papers in the ACL Antholo-
gy using a ?k-best? (with k = 5) string match-
ing algorithm built into a CGI interface. A 
snapshot of this interface is shown in Figure 
1. The matched references were stored to-
gether to produce the citation network. Refer-
ences to publications outside of the AAN 
were recorded but not included in the net-
work. 
 In order to fix the issue of wrong author 
names and multiple author identities we had 
to perform a lot of manual post-processing. 
The first names and the last names were 
swapped for a lot of authors. For example, the 
author name "Caroline Brun" was present as 
"Brun Caroline" in some of her papers. 
Another big source of error was the exclusion 
of middle names or initials in a number of 
papers. For example, Julia Hirschberg had 
two identities as "Julia Hirschberg" and "Julia 
B. Hirschberg". There were a few spelling 
mistakes, like "Madeleine Bates" was miss-
pelled as "Medeleine Bates". 
Finally, many papers included incorrect 
titles in their citation sections. Some used the 
wrong years and/or venues as well.

3 Statistics 
 
Using the metadata and the citations ex-
tracted after curation, we have built three dif-
ferent networks.   
The paper citation network is a directed 
network with each node representing a paper 
labeled with an ACL ID number and the 
edges representing a citation within that paper 
to another paper represented by an ACL ID. 
The paper citation network consists of 13,739 
papers and 54,538 citations.   
The author citation network and the author 
collaboration network are additional networks 
derived from the paper citation network. In 
both of these networks a node is created for 
each unique author. In the author citation 
network an edge is an occurrence of an author 
citing another author. For example, if a paper 
written by Franz Josef Och cites a paper writ-
ten by Joshua Goodman, then an edge is 
created between Franz Josef Och and Joshua 
Goodman. Self citations cause self loops in 
the author citation network. The author cita-
tion network consists of 11,180 unique au-
thors and 332,815 edges (196,905 edges if 
duplicates are removed). 
In the author collaboration network, an 
edge is created for each collaboration. For 
example, if a paper is written by Franz Josef 
Och and Hermann Ney, then an edge is 
created between the two authors.  
Table 1 shows some brief statistics about 
the first two releases of the data set (2006 and 
2007). Table 2 describes the most current re-
lease of the data set (from 2008).

A lot of different statistics have been 
computed based on the data set release in 
2007 by Radev et al The statistics include 
PageRank scores which eliminate PageRank's 
inherent bias towards older papers, Impact 
factor, correlations between different meas-
ures of impact like H-Index, total number of 
incoming citations, PageRank. They also re-
port results from a regression analysis using 
H-Index scores from different sources (AAN, 
Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify 
multi-disciplinary authors.

It must be noted that the PageRank scores 
are not accurate because of the lack of cita-
tions outside AAN. Specifically, out of the 
155,858 total number of citations, only 
54,538 are within AAN.

5 Related phrases 
We have also computed the related phras-
es for every author using the text from the 
papers they have authored, using the simple 
TF-IDF scoring scheme (see Figure 4).

6 Citation summaries 
The citation summary of an article, P, is 
the set of sentences that appear in the litera-
ture and cite P. These sentences usually men-
tion at least one of the cited paper?s contribu-
tions. We use AAN to extract the citation 
summaries of all articles, and thus the citation 
summary of P is a self-contained set and only 
includes the citing sentences that appear in 
AAN papers. Extraction is performed auto-
matically using string-based heuristics by 
matching the citation pattern, author names 
and publication year, within the sentences. 
The following example shows the citation 
summary extracted for ?Koo, Terry, Carreras, 
Xavier, Collins, Michael John, Simple Semi-
supervised Dependency Parsing". The cita-
tion summary of (Koo et al, 2008) mentions 
KCC08, dependency parsing, and the use of 
word clustering in semi-supervised NLP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C08-1051 1 7:191 Furthermore, recent studies revealed that word clustering is useful for semi-supervised learn-
ing in NLP (Miller et al, 2004; Li and McCallum, 2005; Kazama and Torisawa, 2008; Koo et al, 2008). 
 
D08-1042 2 78:214 There has been a lot of progress in learning dependency tree parsers (McDonald et al, 2005; 
Koo et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2008). 
 
W08-2102 3 194:209 The method shows improvements over the method described in (Koo et al, 2008), which 
is a state-of-the-art second-order dependency parser similar to that of (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), suggesting 
that the incorporation of constituent structure can improve dependency accuracy. 
 
W08-2102 4 32:209 The model also recovers dependencies with significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-
art dependency parsers such as (Koo et al, 2008; McDonald and Pereira, 2006). 
 
W08-2102 5 163:209 KCC08 unlabeled is from (Koo et al, 2008), a model that has previously been shown to 
have higher accuracy than (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). 
 
W08-2102 6 164:209 KCC08 labeled is the labeled dependency parser from (Koo et al, 2008); here we only 
evaluate the unlabeled accuracy.

The citation text that we have extracted for 
each paper is a good resource to generate 
summaries of the contributions of that paper. 
We have previously developed systems using 
clustering the similarity networks to generate 
short, and yet informative, summaries of in-
dividual papers (Qazvinian and Radev 2008), 
and more general scientific topics, such as 
Dependency Parsing, and Machine Transla-
tion (Radev et al 2009) . 
 
 
7 Gender annotation 
We have manually annotated the gender of 
most authors in AAN using the name of the 
author. If the gender cannot be identified 
without any ambiguity using the name of the 
author, we resorted to finding the homepage 
of the author. We have been able to annotate 
8,578 authors this way: 6,396 male and 2,182 
female.
