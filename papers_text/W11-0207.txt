Abstract
Medical Entity Recognition is a crucial step
towards efficient medical texts analysis. In
this paper we present and compare three
methods based on domain-knowledge and
machine-learning techniques. We study two
research directions through these approaches:
(i) a first direction where noun phrases are
extracted in a first step with a chunker be-
fore the final classification step and (ii) a sec-
ond direction where machine learning tech-
niques are used to identify simultaneously en-
tities boundaries and categories. Each of the
presented approaches is tested on a standard
corpus of clinical texts. The obtained results
show that the hybrid approach based on both
machine learning and domain knowledge ob-
tains the best performance.
1 Introduction
Medical Entity Recognition (MER) consists in two
main steps: (i) detection and delimitation of phrasal
information referring to medical entities in textual
corpora (e.g. pyogenic liver abscess, infection of bil-
iary system) and (ii) identification of the semantic
category of located entities (e.g. Medical Problem,
Test). Example 1 shows the result of MER on a sen-
tence where the located entity and its category are
marked with treatment and problem tags.
(1) <treatment> Adrenal-sparing surgery
</treatment> is safe and effective , and may
become the treatment of choice in patients
with <problem> hereditary
phaeochromocytoma </problem>.
This task is very important for many applications
such as Question-Answering where MER is used in
the question analysis step (to determine the expected
answers? type, the question focus, etc.) and in the
offline text tagging or annotation.
One of the most important obstacles to identify-
ing medical entities is the high terminological vari-
ation in the medical domain (e.g. Diabetes melli-
tus type 1, Type 1 diabetes, IDDM, or juvenile di-
abetes all express the same concept). Other aspects
also have incidence on MER processes such as the
evolution of entity naming (e.g. new abbreviations,
names for new drugs or diseases). These obstacles
limit the scalability of methods relying on dictionar-
ies and/or gazetteers. Thus, it is often the case that
other types of approaches are developed by exploit-
ing not only domain knowledge but also domain-
independent techniques such as machine learning
and natural language processing tools.
In this paper, we study MER with three dif-
ferent methods: (i) a semantic method relying on
MetaMap (Aronson, 2001) (a state-of-the-art tool
for MER) (ii) chunker-based noun phrase extraction
and SVM classification and (iii) a last method us-
ing supervised learning with Conditional Random
Fields (CRF), which is then combined with the se-
mantic method. With these methods we particularly
study two processing directions: (i) pre-extraction
of noun phrases with specialized tools, followed by
a medical classification step and (ii) exploitation
of machine-learning techniques to detect simultane-
ously entity boundaries and their categories.
We also present a comparative study of the perfor-
mance of different noun phrase chunkers on medical
56
texts: Treetagger-chunker, OpenNLP and MetaMap.
The best chunker was then used to feed some of
the proposed MER approaches. All three methods
were experimented on the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge
corpus of clinical texts (Uzuner, 2010). Our study
shows that hybrid methods achieve the best perfor-
mance w.r.t machine learning approaches or domain
knowledge-based approaches if applied separately.
After a review of related work (Section 2), we de-
scribe the chunker comparison and the three MER
methods (Section 3). We present experiments on
clinical texts (Section 4), followed by a discussion
and variant experiments on literature abstracts (Sec-
tion 5), then conclude and draw some perspectives
for further work (Section 6).
2 Related Work
Several teams have tackled named entity recognition
in the medical domain. (Rindflesch et al, 2000) pre-
sented the EDGAR system which extracts informa-
tion about drugs and genes related to a given can-
cer from biomedical texts. The system exploits the
MEDLINE database and the UMLS. Protein name
extraction has also been studied through several ap-
proaches (e.g. (Liang and Shih, 2005; Wang, 2007)).
(Embarek and Ferret, 2008) proposed an approach
relying on linguistic patterns and canonical entities
for the extraction of medical entities belonging to
five categories: Disease, Treatment, Drug, Test, and
Symptom. Another kind of approach uses domain-
specific tools such as MetaMap (Aronson, 2001).
MetaMap recognizes and categorizes medical terms
by associating them to concepts and semantic types
of the UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Network.
(Shadow and MacDonald, 2003) presented an ap-
proach based on MetaMap for the extraction of med-
ical entities of 20 medical classes from pathologist
reports. (Meystre and Haug, 2005) obtained 89.9%
recall and 75.5% precision for the extraction of med-
ical problems with an approach based on MetaMap
Transfer (MMTx) and the NegEx negation detection
algorithm.
In contrast with semantic approaches which re-
quire rich domain-knowledge for rule or pattern con-
struction, statistical approaches are more scalable.
Several approaches used classifiers such as decision
trees or SVMs (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002). Markov
models-based methods are also frequently used (e.g.
Hidden Markov Models, or CRFs (He and Kayaalp,
2008)). However, the performance achieved by such
supervised algorithms depends on the availability of
a well-annotated training corpus and on the selection
of a relevant feature set.
Hybrid approaches aim to combine the advan-
tages of semantic and statistical approaches and to
bypass some of their weaknesses (e.g. scalability
of rule-based approaches, performance of statistical
methods with small training corpora). (Proux et al,
1998) proposed a hybrid approach for the extraction
of gene symbols and names. The presented system
processed unknown words with lexical rules in order
to obtain candidate categories which were then dis-
ambiguated with Markov models. (Liang and Shih,
2005) developed a similar approach using empiri-
cal rules and a statistical method for protein-name
recognition.
3 Medical Entity Recognition Approaches
Named entity recognition from medical texts in-
volves two main tasks: (i) identification of entity
boundaries in the sentences and (ii) entity catego-
rization. We address these tasks through three main
approaches which are listed in Table 1.
3.1 Noun Phrase Chunking
Although noun phrase segmentation is an important
task for MER, few comparative studies on available
tools have been published. A recent study (Kang et
al., 2010), which claims to be the first to do such
comparative experiments, tested six state-of-the-art
chunkers on a biomedical corpus: GATE chunker,
Genia Tagger, Lingpipe, MetaMap, OpenNLP, and
Yamcha. This study encompassed sentence split-
ting, tokenization and part-of-speech tagging and
showed that for both noun-phrase chunking and
verb-phrase chunking, OpenNLP performed best (F-
scores 89.7% and 95.7%, respectively), but differ-
ences with Genia Tagger and Yamcha were small.
With a similar objective, we compared the perfor-
mance of three different noun-phrase chunkers in the
medical domain: (i) Treetagger-chunker1, a state-of-
the-art open-domain tool, (ii) OpenNLP2 and (iii)

MetaMap. Regardless of the differences in corpora
with (Kang et al, 2010) we chose these particu-
lar tools to compare medical-domain specific tools
with open domain tools and to highlight the lower
performance of MetaMap for noun-phrase chunk-
ing compared to other tools. This last point led
us to introduce the MetaMap+ approach for MER
(Ben Abacha and Zweigenbaum, 2011) in order to
take advantage of MetaMap?s domain-knowledge
approach while increasing performance by relying
on external tools for noun-phrase chunking.
We evaluate these tools on the subset of noun
phrases referring to medical entities in our corpora
(cf. Section 4.1 for a description of the i2b2 cor-
pus and Section 5 for the Berkeley corpus). We
consider that a noun phrase is correctly extracted if
it corresponds exactly to an annotated medical en-
tity from the reference corpora. Also, as our cor-
pora are not fully annotated (only entities of the tar-
geted types are annotated), we do not evaluate ?extra
noun-phrases? corresponding to non-annotated enti-
ties. The retrieved noun phrases are heterogeneous:
many of them are not all relevant to the medical field
and therefore not relevant to the MER task. Our
goal is to obtain the maximal number of correct noun
phrases and leave it to the next step to filter out those
that are irrelevant. We therefore wish to maximize
recall at this stage.
Table 2 shows that in this framework, Treetagger-
chunker obtains the best recall. We thus used it
for noun-phrase segmentation in the experimented
MER approaches (cf. Sections 3.2 and 3.3).
3.2 Semantic and Rule-Based Method: MM+
MetaMap is a reference tool which uses the UMLS
to map noun phrases in raw texts to the best match-
ing UMLS concepts according to matching scores.
MetaMap leads however to some residual problems,
which we can arrange into three classes: (i) noun
phrase chunking is not at the same level of per-
formance as some specialized NLP tools, (ii) med-
ical entity detection often retrieves general words
and verbs which are not medical entities and (iii)
some ambiguity is left in entity categorization since
MetaMap can provide several concepts for the same
term as well as several semantic types for the same
concept. Several ?term/concept/type? combinations
58
are then possible.
To improve MetaMap output, we therefore
use an external noun phrase chunker (cf. Sec-
tion 3.1) and stop-list based filtering to recover fre-
quent/noticeable errors. MetaMap can propose dif-
ferent UMLS semantic types for the same noun
phrase, thus leading to different categories for the
same entity. In such cases we apply a voting pro-
cedure. For instance, if the process retrieves three
UMLS semantic types for one noun phrase where
two are associated to the target category ?Problem?
and one is associated to ?Treatment?, the ?Problem?
category is chosen as the entity?s category. In case
of a tie, we rely on the order output by MetaMap and
take the first returned type.
More precisely, our rule-based method, which we
call MetaMap+ (MM+), can be decomposed into the
following steps:
1. Chunker-based noun phrase extraction. We
use Treetagger-chunker according to the above-
mentioned test (cf. Table 2).
2. Noun phrase filtering with a stop-word list.
3. Search for candidate terms in specialized lists
of medical problems, treatments and tests
gathered from the training corpus, Wikipedia,
Health on the Net and Biomedical Entity Net-
work.
4. Use MetaMap to annotate medical entities
(which were not retrieved in the specialized
lists) with UMLS concepts and semantic types.
5. Finally, filter MetaMap results with (i) a list
of common/noticeable errors and (ii) the selec-
tion of only a subset of semantic types to look
for (e.g. Quantitative Concept, Functional Con-
cept, Qualitative Concept are too general se-
mantic types and produce noise in the extrac-
tion process).
3.3 Statistical Method: TT-SVM
The second presented approach uses Treetagger-
chunker to extract noun phrases followed by a ma-
chine learning step to categorize medical entities
(e.g. Treatment, Problem, Test). The problem is
then modeled as a supervised classification task with
n + 1 categories (n is the number of entity cate-
gories). We chose an SVM classifier.
As noted by (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2010),
SVMs (Support Vector Machines) have advantages
over conventional statistical learning algorithms,
such as Decision Trees or Hidden Markov Mod-
els, in the following two aspects: (1) SVMs have
high generalization performance independent of the
dimension of feature vectors, and (2) SVMs allow
learning with all feature combinations without in-
creasing computational complexity, by introducing
kernel functions.
In our experiments we use the libSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2001) implementation of the SVM classi-
fier. We chose the following feature set to describe
each noun phrase (NP):
1. Word features:
? words of the NP
? number of the NP words
? lemmas of the NP words
? 3 words and their lemmas before the NP
? 3 words and their lemmas after the NP
2. Orthographic features (some examples):
? first letter capitalized for the first word,
one word or all words
? all letters uppercase for the first word, one
word or all words
? all letters lowercase for the first word, one
word or all words
? NP is or contains an abbreviation
? word of NP contains a single upper-
case, digits, hyphen, plus sign, amper-
sand, slash, etc.
3. Part-of-speech tags: POS tags of the NP words,
of the 3 previous and 3 next words.
3.4 Statistical Method: BIO-CRF
We conducted MER with a CRF in one single step
by determining medical categories and entity bound-
aries at the same time. We used the BIO format: B
(beginning), I (inside), O (outside) which represents
entity tagging by individual word-level tagging. For
instance, a problem-tagged entity is represented as
a first word tagged B-P (begin problem) and other
59
(following) words tagged I-P (inside a problem). A
problem entity comprising one single word will be
tagged B-P. Words outside entities are tagged with
the letter ?O?.
If we have n categories (e.g. Problem, Treatment,
Test), we then have n classes of type B-, n classes
of type I- (e.g. P-B and P-I classes associated to the
problem category) and one class of type ?O?. Fig-
ure 1 shows an example sentence tagged with the
BIO format. As a result, the classification task con-
sists in a word classification task (instead of a noun-
phrase classification task) into 2n+1 target classes,
where n is the number of categories. As a conse-
quence, relying on a chunker is no longer necessary.
Figure 1: BIO Format (T = Test, P = Problem)
Words in a sentence form a sequence, and the de-
cision on a word?s category can be influenced by
the decision on the category of the preceding word.
This dependency is taken into account in sequential
models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or
Conditional Random Fields (CRF). In contrast with
HMMs, CRF learning maximizes the conditional
probability of classes w.r.t. observations rather than
their joint probability. This makes it possible to use
any number of features which may be related to all
aspects of the input sequence of words. These prop-
erties are assets of CRFs for several natural language
processing tasks, such as POS tagging, noun phrase
chunking, or named entity recognition (see (Tellier
and Tommasi, 2010) for a survey).
In our experiments we used the CRF++3 imple-
mentation of CRFs. CRF++ eases feature descrip-
tion through feature templates. We list hereafter
some of our main features. We instructed CRF++ to
model the dependency of successive categories (in-
struction B in feature template).
For each word we use the following features:
3http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/
1. Word features: The word itself, two words be-
fore and three words after, with their lemmas.
2. Morphosyntactic features: POS tag of the word
itself, two words before and three words after.
3. Orthographic features (some examples):
? The word contains hyphen, plus sign, am-
persand, slash, etc.
? The word is a number, a letter, a punctua-
tion sign or a symbol.
? The word is in uppercase, capitalized, in
lowercase (AA, Aa, aa)
? Prefixes of different lengths (from 1 to 4)
? Suffixes of different lengths (from 1 to 4)
4. Semantic features: semantic category of the
word (provided by MetaMap+)
5. Other features: next verb, next noun, word
length over a threshold, etc.
Additionally, we tested semantic features con-
structed from MM+ results. More detail on these
last features is given in Section 5.3.
4 Experiments on Clinical Texts
We performed MER experiments on English clinical
texts.
4.1 Corpus
The i2b2 corpus was built for the i2b2/VA 2010
challenge4 in Natural Language Processing for Clin-
ical Data (Uzuner, 2010). The data for this challenge
includes discharge summaries from Partners Health-
Care and from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Cen-
ter (MIMIC II Database), as well as discharge sum-
maries and progress notes from University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center. All records have been fully
de-identified and manually annotated for concept,
assertion, and relation information. The corpus con-
tains entities of three different categories: Problem,
Treatment and Test, 76,665 sentences and 663,476
words with a mean of 8.7 words per sentence. Ex-
ample 2 shows an annotated sentence from the i2b2
corpus.

4.2 Experimental Settings
We tested the above-described five configurations
(see Table 1):
1. MM: MetaMap is applied as a baseline method
2. MM+: MetaMap Plus (semantic and rule-based
method)
3. TT-SVM: Statistical method, chunking with
Treetagger and Categorization with a SVM
classifier
4. BIO-CRF: Statistical method, BIO format with
a CRF classifier
5. BIO-CRF-H: Hybrid method combining se-
mantic and statistical methods (BIO-CRF with
semantic features constructed from MM+ re-
sults)
We evaluate the usual metrics of Recall (proportion
of correctly detected entities among the reference
entities), Precision (proportion of correctly detected
entities among those output by the system), and F-
measure (harmonic means of Recall and Precision).
4.3 Results
Table 4 presents the results obtained by each con-
figuration. BIO-CRF and BIO-CRF-H obtained the
best precision, recall and F-measures. MM+ comes
next, followed by TT-SVM and MetaMap alone.
Table 5 presents the obtained results per each
medical category (i.e. Treatment, Problem and Test)
for three configurations. Again, BIO-CRF-H obtains
the best results for all metrics and all categories.

5 Discussion and Further Experiments
We presented three different methods for MER:
MM+, TT-SVM, and BIO-CRF (with variant BIO-
CRF-H). In this section we quickly present supple-
mentary results obtained on a second corpus with
the same methods, and discuss differences in results
when corpora and methods vary.
5.1 Corpora
Different kinds of corpora exist in the biomedical
domain (Zweigenbaum et al, 2001). Among the
most recurring ones we may cite (i) clinical texts and
(ii) scientific literature (Friedman et al, 2002). Clin-
ical texts have motivated a long stream of research
(e.g. (Sager et al, 1995), (Meystre et al, 2008)), and
more recently international challenges such as i2b2
2010 (Uzuner, 2010). The scientific literature has
also been the subject of much research (e.g. (Rind-
flesch et al, 2000)), especially in genomics for more
than a decade, e.g. through the BioCreative chal-
lenge (Yeh et al, 2005).
61
Section 4 presented experiments in MER on En-
glish clinical texts. To have a complementary
view on the performance of our methods, we per-
formed additional experiments on the Berkeley cor-
pus (Rosario and Hearst, 2004) of scientific litera-
ture abstracts and titles extracted from MEDLINE.
The original aim of this corpus was to study the ex-
traction of semantic relationships between problems
and treatments (e.g. cures, prevents, and side effect).
In our context, we only use its annotation of med-
ical entities. The corpus contains two categories of
medical entities: problems (1,660 entities) and treat-
ments (1,179 entities) in 3,654 sentences (74,754
words) with a mean of 20.05 words per sentence. We
divided the corpus into 1,462 sentences for training
and 2,193 for testing.
We tested the MetaMap (MM), MetaMap+
(MM+) and BIO-CRF methods on the Berkeley cor-
pus. Table 6 presents the results. BIO-CRF again
obtain the best results, but it is not much better than
MM+ in this case.

Table 6: Results on the Berkeley Corpus
We constructed three different models for the
BIO-CRF method: a first model constructed from
the Berkeley training corpus, a second model con-
structed from the i2b2 corpus and a third model
constructed from a combination of the former
two. We obtained the best results with the last
model: F=34.37% (F=22.97% for the first model
and F=30.08% for the second model). These re-
sults were obtained with a feature set with which we
obtained 76.17% F-measure on the i2b2 corpus (i.e.
words, lemmas, morphosyntactic categories, ortho-
graphic features, suffixes and prefixes, cf. set A4 in
Table 7).
The results obtained on the two corpora are not
on the same scale of performance. This is mainly
due to the characteristics of each corpus. For in-
stance, the i2b2 2010 corpus has an average words-
per-sentence ratio of 8.7 while the Berkeley corpus
has a ratio of 20.45 words per sentence. Besides,
the i2b2 corpus uses a quite specific vocabulary such
as conventional abbreviations of medical terms (e.g.
k/p for kidney pancreas and d&c for dilation and
curettage) and abbreviations of domain-independent
words (e.g. w/o for without and y/o for year old).
However, according to our observations, the most
important characteristic which may explain these re-
sults may be the quality of annotation. The i2b2 cor-
pus was annotated according to well-specified crite-
ria to be relevant for the challenge, while the Berke-
ley corpus was annotated with different rules and
less control measures. We evaluated a random sam-
ple of 200 annotated medical entities in the Berkeley
corpus, using the i2b2 annotation criteria, and found
that 20% did not adhere to these criteria.
5.2 Semantic Methods
The semantic methods have the advantage of being
reproducible on all types of corpora without a pre-
processing or learning step. However, their depen-
dency to knowledge reduces their performance w.r.t.
machine learning approaches. Also the development
of their knowledge bases is a relatively slow process
if we compare it with the time which is necessary for
machine learning approaches to build new extraction
and categorization models.
On the other hand, a clear advantage of semantic
approaches is that they facilitate semantic access to
the extracted information through conventional se-
mantics (e.g. the UMLS Semantic Network).
In our experiments we did not obtain good results
when applying MetaMap alone. This is mainly due
to the detection of entity boundaries (e.g. ?no peri-
cardial effusion.? instead of ?pericardial effusion?
and ?( Warfarin? instead of ?Warfarin?).
We were able to enhance the overall performance
of MetaMap for this task by applying several input
and output filtering primitives, among which the use
of an external chunker to obtain the noun phrases.
Our observation is that the final results are limited by
chunker performance. Nevertheless, the approach
provided the correct categories for 52.28% correctly
62
extracted entities while the total ratio of the retrieved
entities with correct boundaries is 60.76%.
5.3 Machine Learning Methods
We performed several tests with semantic features
with the BIO-CRF method. For instance, applying
MM+ on each word and using the obtained medical
category as an input feature for CRF decreased per-
formance from 76.17% F-measure to 76.01%. The
same effect was observed by using the UMLS se-
mantic type instead of the final category for each
word, with an F-measure decrease from 76.17% to
73.55%. This can be explained by a reduction in
feature value space size (22 UMLS types instead of
3 final categories) but also by the reduced perfor-
mance of MetaMap if it is applied at the word level.
The best solution was obtained by transforming
the output of the MM+ approach into BIO format
tags and feeding them to the learning process as
features for each word. Thus, each word in an en-
tity tagged by MM+ has an input feature value cor-
responding to one of the following: B-problem, I-
problem, B-treatment, I-treatment, B-test and I-test.
Words outside entities tagged by MM+ received an
?O? feature value.
With these semantic features we were able to in-
crease the F-measure from 76.19% to 77.55%. Ta-
ble 7 presents the contribution of each feature cate-
gory to the BIO-CRF method on the i2b2 corpus.

6 Conclusion
We presented and compared three different ap-
proaches to MER. Our experiments show that per-
forming the identification of entity boundaries with
a chunker in a first step limits the overall perfor-
mance, even though categorization can be performed
efficiently in a second step. Using machine learning
methods for joint boundary and category identifica-
tion allowed us to bypass such limits. We obtained
the best results with a hybrid approach combining
machine learning and domain knowledge. More pre-
cisely, the best performance was obtained with a
CRF classifier using the BIO format with lexical and
morphosyntactic features combined with semantic
features obtained from a domain-knowledge based
method using MetaMap.
Future work will tackle French corpora with both
a semantic method and the BIO-CRF approach. We
also plan to exploit these techniques to build a cross-
language question answering system. Finally, it
would be interesting to try ensemble methods to
combine the set of MER methods tested in this pa-
per.
