WHERE qUESTIONS

Consider question (i), and the answers to it, (2)-(h)~ 
(i) Where is the Empire State Building? 
(2) In New York. 
(3) In the U.S.A. 
(h) On 3hth Street and 3rd Avenue. 
When (i) is posed in California (2) is the appropriate 
answer to it. This is the case even though (3) and (h) 
are also true characterizations of the location of the 
Empire State Building. The pattern of appropriateness 
alters, however, when the locale where the question 
presented changes. Thus, when (i) is asked in Israel, 
(3) is the appropriate answer, whereas when it is asked 
in Manhattan, (I~) is the answer that should be given. 
The foregoing observations, originally made by Rumelhart 
(197h) and by Norman (1973), suggest the following. 
First, it is not enough for answers to questions to be 
(semantically) true, they have to be (pragmatically) 
appropriate as well. Second, appropriateness is not 
solely determined by the content of the particular prop- 
ositions in question, but also by the identity of the 
participants in the particular conversational situation 
and their locale. In other words, for a person--or for 
a machine, for that matter--to answer questions, it is 
not enough to survey one's memory and retrieve inform- 
ation pertaining to the query posed, rather--a selec- 
tion algorithm has to be used so that an appropriate 
response would be given. The specification of such a 
selection algorithm is the topic of the present invest- 
igation. 
The following discussion is based on what is known as 
the Room Theory: the original, albeit preliminary, 
model proposed by Rumelhart(197~) in order to account 
for his insightful observations. I try to examine the 
psychological validity of this model, and to propose 
amendments and extensions to it on the basis of empir- 
ical data. 
Theory. '\[~le correspondence between the data and the 
Theory is on two counts. First, there is the seeming- 
ly trivial observation that answers tO different ques- 
tions are given on diff,:rent levels. Specifically, 
there is a correlation between the level of the object 
which is queried and the room on which the respective 
answer is given. Second, and less trivial, is the 
observation that answers vary not only with the ques- 
tions, but also with the spatial relationship which 
holds between the object of the question and the parti- 
cipants in the conversation. Several loci in the data 
are indicative of this last pattern. First none of the 
Americans indicated that the Empire State Building was 
"in the U.S.", bu~ a third of the Israelis did so; 
further, some of the Americans, but none of the Israelis, 
indicated that the building was "in Manhattan". Second, 
asked about New York City, almost all Israelis, but none 
of the Americans, answered on the country level. Fur- 
ther, the distribution of the answer patterns furnished 
by the members of each group changed according to wheth- 
er the queried city was their own, or close/distant 
from it. Finally, children's answers to questions about 
objects also vary with how distant the object is. 
Above, however, I have qualified the correspondence bet- 
ween the data and the theory; this qualification should 
now be clarified. I don't think it is meaningful to 
Judge the validity of a model llke the Room Theory by 
examining the percentage of cases in which its predic- 
tions hold. Such a percentage may reflect the structure 
of the domain (questions) under investigation, and it 
need not be indicative of the adequacy of the model as 
such. The term "by and large" is, however, of qualit- 
ative significance. It indicates that unless other 
factors or reasons are operative, answers to where ques- 
tions do, indeed, follow the Room A/gorithm. The detec- 
tion of these "other factors and reasons", their class- 
ification and the characterization of the answer types 
that correspond to them is the main theme of this dis- 
cussion. Following, then, are the answer patterns which 
do not conform with the Room Theory. 
The Room Theory "posits the existence of a psychologic- 
al room relative to which distances are reckoned. The 
room corresponds to the smallest geographical region 
that encompasses both the reference location of the 
conversants and the location of the places in question". 
When answering where-questions "the rule is to find the 
smallest room which Just includes the reference location 
and the answer location. The appropriate answer is the 
next smallest geographical unit which contains the loc- 
ation in question, but axcludes the reference location". 
(Rumelhart, 1975). The answers generated by this al- 
gorithm, note, constitute the placing of the item ques- 
tioned in a room which is larger than it; henceforth 
answers of this type will be called vertical. 
In order to examine the Room Theory, questions regard- 
ing places in the world as well as objects in a (con- 
crete) room were presented to several subject popula- 
tions: college students in Israel and the U.S., Ameri- 
can children of three age groups, and aphasic patients. 
The present report concentrates on the adult data, and 
only cursory remarks will be made on the answers furn- 
ished by the other populations. First, I will discuss 
answers solicited by an open questionnaire, in which 
subjects were asked to give one answer to the questions 
posel to them; later, answers solicited by closed ques- 
tionnaires will be discussed. 
First, it should be noted that by and large the answers 
given by subjects were the ones predicted by the Room 
First, consider questions about landm-~ks in the towns 
in which the conversation took place. Most of the ans- 
wers which involved vertical placement were given on the 
level of the town itself, i.e. on a level which is high- 
er than the one predicted by the Room Theory. The other 
answers were not vertical, but rather horizontal:the 
object questioned was related to another object similar 
to it. In other words, either the level specified by 
the Room Theory was changed, or the type of answer (i.e. 
the generation algorithm itself) was altered. These 
deviant answers are viewed as two 81ternative solutions 
to the problem of the floor effect. Specifically, as 
one goes down the place hierarchy, the specification of 
rooms between the target and the least common room is 
cumbersome; indeed, there might not be simple names by 
which reference to these rooms may be made. Subjects 
solve this problem either by staying on the level of the 
least common room or by shifting to the horizontal 
s t ra te~, .  
The same problem is noted with the ceilin~ effect, name- 
ly, with questions regarding objects which are very high 
on the place hierarchy: continents for adults, countries 
for children and aphasic patients. The answers in these 
cases were varied, a feature which attests the algOr-- 
ithm/c difficulty associated with them. Only a minor- 
ity of the answers conformed with the Room Theory and 
most answers were horizontal. Other answer types were: 
vacuous, in which a vertical answer was given on too 
high a level (e.g. "in the world"), featural, in which 
73 
a descr ip t ion ,  ra ther  than a spec i f i ca t ion  of  the loca le ,  
was given (e .g .  " i t  i s  a cont inent" ) ,  or  tauto log ica l  
(e .g .  " Japan is  in Japan" ) .  The di~'ferent answer types ,  
we sha l l  say,  are the products  o~ d i f fe rent  a l te rnat ive  
answer generat ion  a lgor i thms.  The numer ica l  d i s t r ibu -  
t ion  of  these answers suggest  that  the order  of  p re fer -  
ence for the application of the algorithms as the one 
noted above. 
There were also cases in which subjects gave answers on 
a level lower than the one predicted by the Room Theory. 
Thus, half the Israelis placed the Empire State Building 
Tin New York", and not "in the U.S." Similarly, all the 
Americans asked about the Eiffel Tower answered "in 
Paris", and not "in France". These patterns are attrib- 
uted to p romlnence. Prominent objects are ones which 
gain a higher ra-~ in the place h/erarchy than would be 
attributed to them on semantic classificatory grounds 
alone. As a consequence, these objects are placed in a 
room which is more specific then the one predicted by 
the Room Theory. For instance, New York City is not 
conceived of by non-Americans as Just another American 
city; it gains an autonomy of its own and is conceived 
of as independent of the country in which it is located. 
The prominence effect suggests that rather than inter- 
preting the room-hierarchy in a concrete fashion (i.e. 
as isomorphic to the spatial relations which hold in 
the physical world), one should view it as an abstract 
conceptual representation. In this representation, ob- 
Jects ere associated with ta~s: usually, objects which 
are actually contained in objects of order n are assign- 
ed a tag of order n?l, but prominent objects are assign- 
ed tags of  the same order  as the  ob jec ts  which ac tua l ly  
conta in  them. Thus, i f  the Empire S ta te  Bui ld ing i s  
tagged n?l  both New York and the U.S. are  tngged n ,  fo r  
the I s rae l i s  the leas t  com-~n room (order  n - l )  i s  the  
nor thern  hemisphere,  and the answer is  g iven on the  lev -  
e l  o f  the t~o rooms of  order  n .  Thus, the seemingly 
unexpected answers associated with prominent objects are 
due to  the modif ied abst rac t  representat ions ,  not to a 
change in the(ver t i ca l )  a lgor i thm proper .  
The salience effect is similar, but distinct. Objects 
which are close to ones which stand ia a particular rel- 
ation to the respondent (i.e. physically close, emotion- 
ally dear, or belonging to the subject) are not placed 
in a room but receive horizontal answers instead. For 
example, all the Israelis answered that Lebanon was 
"north of Israel", and not that it was "in the Mid- 
East". Similarly, all the Americans (and half of the 
Israells) placed Canada in relation to the U.S. Unlike 
the prominence effect, the salience effect does affect 
the answer generation algorithm itself, and it bears on 
individual or cultural differences, not on general sem- 
antic com-lderatlons. 4 Specifically, items which ere 
special to the speaker are tagged in the representation 
as marked, and this triggers a shift from the vertical 
to the horizontal algorlthm. 
All questions considered so far involved one config- 
uration: the two conversants and the target were phys- 
ically distinct, and together they could he contained in 
one COmmOn room. This, however, is not the only possi- 
ble con?iguratlon. Other confi&~aratious, are possible 
as well: (a) The conversants and the target may coin- 
cide in place, as in the question '~here are we now?". 
(b) The conversants ~ay be contained in the target, as 
in the question "Where is Israel?" when Posed in Jerus- 
alem. (c) The conversants may be in different places, 
as in phone conversations. 
Strictly speaklng, the Room Algorithm does not apply to 
these configuratlons. Thus, in (b) the least common 
room is one level above that of the target, but on what 
level would the answer be? The Room Algorithm would 
either return the respondent to the place queried or 
else require detailed and perhaps cumbersomDclassific- 
atlons, neither option is taken. All the answers to the 
questions noted were given on the room immediately above 
the target. In (a) a least common room may not be cir- 
cumscribed in the manner outlined by the Room Algorithm, 
whereas in (c) a distinction between the speaker and the 
hearer has to be introduced. All these cases suggest 
that the different confi~Jrations do invoke different 
generation algorithms. Hence, an appraisal of the con- 
Flguration is necessary prior to the application of the 
answer-generation algorithm proper. 
So far, the discussion was topological, considering only 
the spatial configuration holding between the conversants 
and the object questioned. The respondent 's knowledge 
of the world was not taken into account. In order to 
prove the psycho log ica l  va l id i ty  o f  an answer generat ion  
algorithm it is crucial to demonstrate that the answer 
given is chosen from a class of several feasible answers, 
and is not the only one possible due to a limited data 
base. This was the purpose of the closed questionnaires. 
Two such questionnaires were administered: first, sub- 
Jests were asked to choose the best of several answers 
given to them; then they were asked to mark all the 
answers they deemed true. Three points were of interest. 
First, the answers given in the first two conditions 
were not necessarily the most specified ones marked in 
the third. Second, there were answers in the multiple 
option condition which were evidently true and commonly 
known but which were nonetheless not marked by subjects. 
These answers included reversed prominence (i.e. the 
relation of a prominent object to a less prominent one), 
featural answers and ones which were too high on the 
place hierarchy. Third, an "~ don't know" answer on 
the open questionns/re did not necessarily imply a no- 
answer in the other conditions. In other words, this 
answer does not signify complete ignorance, but rather 
an appreciation on the part of the subject that he can- 
not f~u'nish the  answer he deemm appropr ia te .  Together ,  
the  three  po in ts  ind icate  that  there  i s  indeed a psy -  
cho log ica l  p rocess  of  answer -generat ion  which does not  
amount to the specification Of the most detailed inform- 
ation one has regarding the object in question. 
Still another aspect which has to be considered is the 
speaker's intention when he poses a question. A study 
~ this aspect is just on its way now and at this point, 
I have to limit myself only to a methodological discuss- 
ion. Evidently, the process of question-answering re- 
quires an appraisal of intention (of. Lehnert, !978), 
one which involves the evaluation of various contertual, 
personal and sociological factors. In order to make 
research feasible, as well as constructive, a factor- 
izatlon of the domain of question-answering, I believe, 
is needed. In this regard the topological, knowledge 
and intention aspects were noted. The original Room 
Theory is an attempt to define the topological aspect. 
The present study shows that even for this 8spect this 
Theory is not sufficient. The present discussion sugg- 
ests that an extended topological theory should consist 
of the following components : 
I. Semantic and episodic representations, which are 
not isomorphic to the physically (logically) 
defined room-hierar chy. 
2. Determinants of confi~Irations and problematic 
cases (floor, ceiling). 
3. A set of ordered answer-generation algorithms: 
vertical place~nent (the algorithm proposed by the 
Room Theory), horizontal relation, featural des- 
crlption and non-informatlve (vacuous, tautolog- 
Ical) ? 
Definitely, the topological consideration is not suffic- 
ient for the characterization of how people answer where 
questions. Future investigations should ex~cend the 
research and also include considerations of k~owledge 
and intention. At this Juncture, however, we can no~e 
74 
that it is not possible to reduce question answering to 
knowledge alone, and that some formal selection algor- 
ithms have to be postulated. The formal study of such 
al~orithms is of relevance to the study of both natural 
and artificial intelligence.
