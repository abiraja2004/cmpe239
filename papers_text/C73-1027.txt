AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY 
FOR 
COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC 
PROCESSING SYSTEMS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
R. F. SIMMONS (1970) and M. PA~AK and A. W. PRATT (1971) point 
out that no computerized system using natural anguage ither as part 
of the processor or as the object processed and having a syntactico-se- 
mantic component has a lexicon of more than a few hundred items 
(except for the SNOV' s medical exicon). It is obvious from the lack 
? of success of large-scale computerized systems using natural language 
data that better solutions will be reached if these systems have a large 
lexicon as an integra.1 component. Our purpose is to build a large scale 
dictionary 1of English which will incorporate important recent research 
into language structure and which will have the potential of being used 
either as part of a computerized natural language-using system or as 
a large data base, itself a source for further syntactico-semantic studies. 
There are a number of specific problems that anyone who constructs 
a large-scale computerized ictionary must resolve. First, as discussed 
in B,. N. SMITH (1972) and P. B. GovE (1972), a computerized dictionary 
must incorporate additional types of data than is available in standard 
dictionaries. Since standard ictionaries and some of their computerized 
counterparts define words in terms of other words, they are of necessity 
circular. In addition, the efficiency of any system will depend on the 
size and  form of the dictionary. Any usable large-scale dictionary of 
English probably would have to contain at least 200,000 entries (in- 
cluding inflected forms). 
1 We distinguish lexicon and dictionary by considering anentry in the latter as being 
the same information asthe corresponding entry in the former but with added efinition. 
304 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL 
If each entry is defined as in a standard ictionary with, say, 20 words 
used in the definition then there must be storage for 4,000,000 words. 
In addition if, as has been proposed in N. CHOMSlIY (1965), each entry 
has syntactico-semantic features attached we will encounter a similar 
problem: entries probably need on the average 20 features to specify 
them. Finally, when words are arbitrarily stored in computer systems, 
with pointers directing the search from word to word (cf. M. R. QmL- 
LIAN, 1968), the search algorithm can be long. 
With all of these problems in mind, we have defined a theoretical 
model which we expect will eliminate or substantially reduce these very 
real limitations of computerized dictionaries discussed above. The pur- 
pose of our research is to implement the scheme, so that it may be used 
in artificial intelligence systems; as a data base for computer assisted 
instruction systems (e.g. PLATO), and as a tool for lexical testing (cf. 
J. OLNEY, D. R.aMSEY, 1972) and information retrieval (e.g. cf. C. 
SALTON, 1971; W. A. WOODS, 1972). 
2. LEXICAL INFORMATION 
Until recently much of the interesting research in lexicology has 
been carried out in the Soviet Union. The Soviets have long been con- 
cerned with automated language processing and attribute the lack of 
success at this task to the lack of a sophisticated lexical theory. Diction- 
aries are quite inadequate in giving Us insight into the nature of words. 
There is no way, for example, that one could learn a language using 
a dictionary. In addition, definitions in dictionaries are circular: every 
word is defined in terms of every other word (actually approximately 
50 % of the vocabulary appears in the definitions (JOHN OLNEY, per- 
sonal communication)). 
Some of the most innovative research in Soviet lexicology has been 
carried out by 2olkovsky, Mel'~uk and Apresjan (cf. A.K. 2OLKOVSKY 
and I. A. MEL'~UX, 1970, YU. D. API~SJAN, 1967, and Yu. D. AP~- 
SJAN, I. A. MEL'&m and A. D. 2OLKOVSKY, 1969). Initially, they felt 
that the detailed syntactic properties of a word composed its meaning 
- in a structural rather than substantive sense. Their approach was 
first to classify words using grammatical criteria; for example, Apresjan 
classified verbs as being able to undergo the passive transformation or 
as being able or unable to take a complementary infinitive, accusative 
objects or locative adverbial phrases. 
" ~ w ~ - - W = * ~ e ~ m . ~  =,~ ~ x f - - . . -~-~, - - . ,  ~-  - ,~  , - - -  ~- ,  ~ ~- - . . .~ ,~ . . . . . .  ~-  . ~ , - - - , . 7 = ~  ., ~ ~ 
AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 305 
Their theory is essentially a structuralist one. In one of their studies 
they proposed a revision of the notion "word field ". That is, their 
lexico-structural nalysis begins with an enumeration of the phrase 
types of a language, revealed by syntactic analysis; an indication of 
the frequency of each of the structural patterns; and finally an enumer- 
ation of the word meanings found in each pattern. 
In Yu. D. APRESJAN, I. A. MEL'~UK and A. D. 2OLKOVSKY (1969) 
and elsewhere they propose that a dictionary which displays "the proc- 
ess of text generation as an integral succession of steps" be constructed. 
They state that the dictionary should be based on the following prin- 
ciple: 
... it must be fully sufficient for a smooth, idiomatic and flexible ex- 
pression of a given meaning; that is to say, it must display in an explicit 
and logical form whatever information may be necessary for the correct 
choice and usage of words and phrases to convey a given idea in a speech 
context. 
The proposed ictionary is "combinatory" because " i t  is primarily 
intended to d!splay the combinatorial properties of words. " It is "ex- 
planatory" because the syntactic government patterns are semantically 
interpreted with the goal of providing idiomatic expression of any 
given meaning. 
The typical entry in their dictionary would have the following 
format: 
a) Entry word 
b) Morphological information 
c) Definition 
d) Syntactic potential of word 
e) Regular lexical functions 
f) Non-regular lexical functions 
g) The "lexical universe" of entry 
11) Examples 
i) Phraseology (idiomatic expressions) 
. j) Discrimination of synonyms and near-synonyms. 
Concerning the definition (c), they specify that they not be circular. 
They state that " i f  this requirement is met, all the definitions will in 
the long run be reduced to a small number of indefinable units of mean- 
ing (elementary meanings). " (This is the same goal as the UCLA 
lexicography project.) An example of this can be found in McCawley's 
20 
306 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELL 
work with lexical atoms (J. MCCAWLEY, 1968). That is, redden has the 
semantic atoms " cause to come to be red. " It is important to note that 
the definition of a word should be an exact paraphrase of the word 
using these semantic atoms. 
The notion of lexical functions is the principle innovation of their 
dictionary. Lexical function involves establishing relationships between 
words. Examples from Yu. D. APRESJAN, I, A. MEL'~UX and A. D. 
~OLKOVSHY (1969) are the following: 
(1) 
(2)

Mult (flowers) - bunch 
Mult (sheep) - flock 
Figur-standard figurative designation

(46) 
oper (recession) - to experience 
Fin-verb meaning " to cease ", " to stop " 
Fin (sound) - to die away 
Fin (patience) - to lose 
Son-verb denoting typical sound 
Son (lion) - to roar 
Son (snake) - to hiss 
What they mean by information about the lexical universe of a 
word is "an informal description of a suflqciendy broad piece of reality 
including the given situation as a constituent element. " For example, 
the lexical universe of student would include such lexical items as books, 
classes, college, instructor, study, exam and so on. 
Finally, description of near synonyms would involve a listing of all 
words connected toa lexical item by connotations. Connotations involve, 
of course, literary and emotional overtones of words. A terrorist is, 
for example, a guerrilla whose cause we have emotional disagreement 
with. 
Their notion of syntactic potential corresponds somewhat to Fill- 
more's case frames. That is, for Fillmore, a dictionary must specify the 
case potential of words. For example, in the sentences 
(1) 
(2) 
a) John hit the ball with a bat. 
b) The bat hit the ball. 
c) John hit the window with the ball. 
d) *John hit the window with the ball with the bat. 
e) *The window hit. 
a) John broke the window with the ball. 
b) The ball broke the window. 
c) The window broke. 
d) The ball broke the window. 
bodl hit and broke can have agents as subject. Notice also that in the case 
of hit the object always remains after the verb, but broke allows the 
object to be the subject. Both verbs allow the instrument to be the sub- 
ject. And all of this information comes under "syntactic potential. " 
Fillmore's current (C. J. FILLMORE, 1970) " cases " are agent, expe- 
riencer, instrument object, source, goal, place, time, and extent. The 
syntactic potential of a word (in the sense of AVa~SJAN et al, 1969) de- 
termines the case of a lexical item (and the case frame of a verb). For 
example, in the sentences 
308 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELL 
(3) a) *Personally, I'm sixty-five. 
b) Personally, I'm happy. 
the reason for the non-bizarreness of (b) is that the subject of be happy 
must be an "experiencer ". On the other hand the verbal be warm can 
have an experiencer, object, instrument, place, or time as its subject: 
(4) a) Algernon is warm. 
b) The rock is warm. 
c) The coat is warm. 
d) Texas is warm. 
e) Summers are warm. 
In particular, C. J. FrrtMOm~ (1969, p. 109) feels that the lexicon must 
make accessible to the user 
(i) the nature of the deep-structure syntactic environments into 
which the item may be inserted; 
(ii) the properties of the item to which the rules of grammar are 
sensitive; 
(iii) for an item that can be used as a " predicate ", the number' 
of " arguments " that it conceptually requires; 
(iv) the role(s) which each argument plays in the situation which 
the item, as predicate, can be used to indicate; 
(v) the presuppositions or "happiness conditions" for the use of 
the item, the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the item to be 
used " apdy "; 
(vi) the nature of the conceptual or morphological relatedness of 
the item to other items in the lexicon; 
(vii) its meaning; and 
(viii) the phonological or orthographic shapes which the item as- 
sumes under given grammatical conditions. 
Although dictionaries are the most popular way to define words, 
there are other ways than dictionaries for specifying the meanings 2 
of  a word within a certain lexical system. For example, U. WmNP, r~CH 
~(1963), in his review of Soviet semantic research, speaks of  three ways 
? of  specifying word-meanings: 
It should be clear that we are not using the term ' me.aning' and ' def init ion'  
synonomously. 
AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 309 
1) by lexicographic definition (like the dictionary); 
2) by locating the lexical item in a synonym system; 
3) by establishing the syntactic properties of the lexical items. 
Point (1) has been discussed above. As for point (2) M. MINSKY (1968) 
has a few interesting comments on the possibility of constructing a the- 
saurus-like dictionary (which would be, in effect, a synonym dictionary): 
My thesis is simply that we must not try to evade the' thesaurus prob- 
lem' just because we (rightly) can never be satisfied with any particular 
thesaurus. We must still learn how to build them, and find ways to make 
machines first to use them, then to modify them, and eventually to build 
for themselves new and better ones (p. 27). 
There has been much recent research in current linguistic theory 
with respect o Weinreich's third way of analyzing a terminological 
system, by syntactic haracterization f words. The J. FreEDMAN (1971) 
computerized lexicon included information about the types of transfor- 
mations that a word can undergo as well as some rudimentary semantic 
information (in the form of features). Other information that has not 
been included in computerized systems to any great extent are such no- 
tions as "factivity " (as defined by P. IfivARSKY and C. KIPARSKY, 1970) 
and notions of "genericity " and "specificity " (as discussed in R. 
JACK~NDOrF, 1973). Another important syntactic development that has 
found its way into lexical systems is "case structure" as mentioned 
earlier and as elaborated in C. J. FILLMO~ (1968, 1969, 1971), R. P. 
STOCKW~LL et al (1973). Most of these interesting and important facts 
of language have not been incorporated into computerized or standard 
dictionaries. 
An additional type of information to be included in a lexicon should 
be the non-discrete syntactic and semantic features proposed by Ross 
and by Lakoff. Both linguists, working in syntax and semantics, re- 
spectively, have discovered variable acceptability of syntactic and se- 
mantic features within a given structure. Lakoffproposes to account for 
this variable strength probabilistically, basing his research on results 
from the theory of fuzzy sets. In our work on interactive lexicon 
construction, we have found a variation in responses due, we presumed, 
to regional, social, psychological nd perhaps chronological differences. 
This probabilistic information, measured in response time, should also 
be included in a lexicon as information pertinent o utterance under- 
standing and production.

3. CONTENTS OF THE LEXICON 
The purpose of this section is to describe in specific detail what our 
dictionary will look like and how we plan to incorporate the data dis- 
cussed in the previous section. 
First, we propose to tag the following syntactico-semantic informa- 
tion on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs which we assume to be 
crucial: for every lexical entry in each part of speech we will record: 
1) Entry word. 
2) Part of speech. 
3) Semantic field. 
4) Dictionary definition. 
5) Irregular inflectional morphology. 
6 )  Derivational morphology. (Prefixed forms are relatively easily 
retrievable from the hyphenated form of the word in the dic- 
tionary with a table of prefixes. Suffixed forms can be retrieved 
for productive suffixes by checking the ending against a list of 
suffmes including the combining forms recorded in Webster's. 
The purpose of this will in part be to be able to relate lexical 
entries from the same root.) 
7) Synonyms including synonymous cross-references (available 
from NIH research group) plus annotations from synonym par- 
agraphs in the Webster's Dictionary. Suffixed forms are retrievable 
in part from run-on entries with notation as to source and tar- 
get parts of speech. 
8) Antonyms when available. 
(1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are available direcdy from Webster's: 4 and 6 
are available in part from the derived data sets from the Lexicog- 
raphy Project users group.) 
9) Example of use for each definition under a traditional main entry 
available from the Brown English Corpus. 
10) Response time for sentences by informant and averaged by sen- 
tence over all informants. 
11) Informant data, available from informant, including region, class, 
sex, age, race and economic status. 
In addition we will record information peculiar to each part of speech: 
For nouns (t ? be derived from defining formula whenever possible, 
otherwise interactively and by hand): 
AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 311 
1) The following syntactico-semantic features: 
4- human, 4- animate, :k count, 4- concrete, 4- male, 4- female. 
Also, the following non-binary features which could be treated as 
a property list or as a set of functions in the" sense of S. MARX (1972) :
used as an instrument, indication of quantity or degree, movable, pro- 
longed, separable, color, and shape. These were posited on the basis 
of the defining formulae in Webster's. 
2) Case markings. 
3) Metaphorical extension. (We may find that this category, as 
well as others, are probably derivable from other information, but at 
the moment it isn't clear and so this information is being listed sepa- 
rately.) 
4) Sociolinguistic restrictions on use of the entry. 
For verbs: 
1) Complementizers. 
2) Subcategorization. 
3) Defining verb, that is, the verb, if present, used in defining 
the entry, e.g. be, become, come, have, make, etc. These may be relatable 
to McCawley's interpretation of kill as " to  cause to become not alive, " 
and to our notion of semantic field discussed below. 
4) Selectional features related to noun features such as animate 
subject. 
5) Presuppositions and their differences from synonyms o f  the 
entry. 
6) Case structure ,(number and type of arguments.) 
For adverbs: 
1) Type: time, manner, location, direction, degree. 
(Much of this can be gotten from the defining formulae.) 
2) Position sensitivity: subject-oriented, speaker-oriented, verb- 
oriented, or sentence-oriented. 
For adjectives: 
1) The kind of noun it can or must modify, e.g. animate, con- 
crete, count; and the manner in which it modifies (e.g. warm stove, 
warm coat) and whether it is a relative term (hot/cold) or absolute (black/ 
white). 
2) Semantic properties/functions: color, time, location, size, and 
quality. (These are disjunct sets.)

4. METHODOLOGY 
The plan for the dictionary is to produce a core English lexicon con- 
sisting of the 20,000 most frequent words listed in H. KU~ERA and 
W. N. FRANCIS (1967). The reason for choosing these is that in theory 
they account for 98 ~o of the words in running text. 
As described in section 3 we havea very good idea of what to include 
in the lexicon, although this must obviously be left open-ended. There 
are problems of division of labor, however: that is, how can we most 
efficiently capture the information that we want to include. We have 
narrowed the various possible ways down to three: 
1) by hand (including a real time text editing scheme) 
2) interactively 
3) by automated processing of a standard ictionary. 
: Method (1) is obvious. As for method (2) Olney (J. OLNEY, D. 
RAMSEY, 1973, p. 16) says, " what better source than the disambiguated 
parsed \[= formatted\] transcripts of W 7 and MPD \[The Merriam 
Pocket Dictionary, which is also on tape\] is there likely to be in the near 
future for obtaining semantic data pertaining to the English vocabulary 
as a whole? ". We feel that there is a better source, at least for the kinds 
of information that we are interested in, and that is the native speaker 
of English. lk. N. SMITH (1972) describes a way of obtaining this data 
314 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELL 
interactively (in a system which has been described by R. L. WmMANN 
(1972, p. 9) as " one of the most successful projects currently under 
way ") and the reader should consult hat work for details. 
As to method (3) we have been influenced by the work of one of the 
largest groups and one of the most potentially successful groups involved 
in automating the process of lexicon construction from standard ic- 
tionaries, viz., the user's group emanating from the Lexicographic 
Project headed by JoaN OI.NtY of the Institute of Library Research at 
the University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Sys- 
tems Development Corporation. This project began in July 1966 with 
the initiation of transcribing Merriam-Webster's Seventh Collegiate 
Dictionary in computer processable form. Since then collaboration with 
over 30 researchers at various institutions has led to the creation of 
approximately 50 data sets derived from the dictionary transcript. A 
few of the data sets have been used in disambiguating the entries in the 
dictionary - the principal first goal of this philosophically, rather than 
linguistically, oriented project. Some of this has been relatively success- 
ful but based on the scope and the methods used, it is clear that still a 
great deal more time and effort will have to be expended. 
Some of the already existent derived data sets are useful. The group 
at SDC has formatted the original transcript of Webster's Seventh so 
that the main entry, the etymology, the pronunciation, etc. are all put 
into a fixed format of card image records where the first character of 
each record specifies the type of information recorded, e.g. whether 
the record is one of the words used in the definition of a main entry. 
All of the subsequent data sets have been derived from this formatted 
version. One of these is an alphabetized list of the first 86 characters of 
all definitions eparately and by part of speech. In addition all syn- 
onomous cross-references have been extracted, alphabetized on the main 
entry form and on the word referred to. Also, there are various suffixal 
data sets used in aiding to correlate suffmes with definitions. 
Samples of print-out for sorted definitions within part of speech 
and end-alphabetized within part of speech are appended. The former 
has been especially productive by giving us quite a good deal of insight 
into so-called defining formulae and these defining formulae have in 
turn allowed us to posit certain features which can be extracted irectly 
from the definitions. These defining formulae will be used in extracting 
some of the features from Webster's. (Some features uch as" + human" 
cannot be extracted automatically, except by listing, by the interactive 
scheme described above or, by some inferential scheme.) We have also 
AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 315 
constructed a xwIc concordance for a portion of the data on non-func- 
tion words in the definitions which will lead to short-cuts for syntac- 
tic-semantic tagging. 
5. STRUCTURING THE DATA 
The innovation that we propose to implement in this computerized 
dictionary that will allow us to structure and store all of the information 
discussed above fficiently and accurately is that of the "semantic field. " 
The theory of semantic fields is not new; what is new is the use of this 
concept o structure semantic information. Its most appealing char- 
acteristic is that it eliminates the need for redundant information (the 
problem with the feature approach which is widely used) and it makes 
retrieval much more efficient. First we will discuss the motivation for 
such a system as a model for semantic structure. 
Some of the most interesting empirical evidence for semantic fields 
has been in work done by Marshall and Newcombe in psycholinguistics 
and by Whitaker, Kehoe, Schnitzer and others in neuro-linguistics. 
H. A. WmTAKER (1971) has described the remarkable correspondence 
of the distinct cellular arrays in the cortex of the brain to the classical 
divisions of the language system: the semantic/syntactic component, 
the lexicon, and the phonological component. 
For example, it has been found that the lexicon has an existence apart 
from the syntactic-semantic (or logical) aspects of language. A case 
study reported by H. A. WHITAKER (1971), described a woman who 
was unable "to  initiate conversation r to demonstrate g neral cognitive 
skills - in brief, the semantic and syntactic aspects of language were to- 
tally lost. She was however, able to repeat verbal material well, ... " 
(p. 190). Whitaker has postulated that the lexicon is a separate neural 
component, perhaps biochemically coded in nerve cells. That the lex- 
icon, a separate component, is organized in some sort of semantic 
field arrangement was pointed out again and again by Whitaker. In 
work done by E. WEIGL and M. BIERWISCH (1970), they described er- 
rors which were the results of substitutions of words for other words 
from the same semantic fields; e.g., trousers for blouse, tie for cuff, bodice 
for cardigan, sandals for socks, peaches for oranges, bananas for figs, pota- 
toes for vegetables. Of particular note is that the substitutions usually 
occur at the .same taxonomic level, that is, the substitution is rarely an 
316 RAOUL N. SMITH- EDWARD MAXWELL 
item for the name of the field containing the item (e.g., peaches for 
fruit). 
In another study, by H. GOODGLASS, \]3. KLEIN, P. CAREY and K. 
JoN~s (1966), the investigators chose words which came within the cat- 
egories of objects, forms, letters, actions, numbers, colors, and body 
parts. They found that the patients had an easier time understanding 
object names than producing them, but producing letters was easier 
for them than understanding them. 
J. C. MARSrr~t. and F. NEWCOMBE (1966) reported errors such as the 
following: their patient read liberty as freedom, canary as parrot, abroad 
as  overseas, entertain as entertainment, political as politician and beg as 
beggar. Later studies of the same patient showed that the patient had 
twice as much difficulty with verbs than with nouns and that adjectives 
were harder than nouns but easier than verbs. One of the problems 
encountered was the patient's tendency to read verbs as the correspond- 
ing derived nominal and to read nominals derived from adjectives as 
the original base form of the adjective. Words like uncle, priest and poet 
were harder than horse, lion, and insect. Large was read as long, short as 
small, tall as long, little, as short. 
H. A. WraTAgra (1971) reports patients who read verbs as their cor- 
responding derived nominal form: decide is read as decision, conceal as 
concealment, ominate as nomination, portray as portrait, bathe as bath, speak 
as discussion, remember as memory. Whitaker also reports that the opposite 
phenomenon has been found where derived forms are read as their base 
forms: refusal was read as refuse, darkness as dark, whiteness as white, 
amazement as amaze. 
Psycholinguistic and anthropological data therefore point to the 
reality of organization i to semantic fiekts and success of information 
retrieval schemes has often been tied into a division of the semantic 
universe into fields. It would seem not only an obvious desideratum but 
a sine qua non in a dictionary to include information of semantic field. 
Once the data has been recorded so that all words are completely 
defined we will eliminate redundant information so that storing of the 
lexicon can be accomplished most economically. The elimination of 
redundancy will be done by means of structuring the data in a specific 
way. This method has been discussed in E. MAXWEL~ (t973). 
In effect what happens i this: the head of a semanticfield (call it 
L) is defined in a certain way; the members of that semantic field (xl, 
z~ ...x,) are defined in relation to L. All the information that need be 
specified to define, zl, etc. is that information that is unique to them. 
AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY FOR COMPUTERIZED SYNTACTIC 317 
For example, there is the semantic field (described in C.J. FmLMO~, 
1971) made up of the verbs: judge, accuse, blame, scold, forgive, etc. All 
of the verbs are verbs of judging (which is the name of the semantic 
fled.) They are uniquely defined in terms of their presuppositions (i.e. 
accuse presupposes that the action done is bad)..Therefore, by defining 
judge and by saying that accuse, etc. are kinds of judging except for their 
presuppositions all redundant information can be deleted and the spe- 
cific definitions can be derived with inferential schemata. 
An example of how the information would be stored is the 
following (using the word boil): 
\[(***) (***) xx (***) (A) (***) (A) (***)\] 
SF AGENT OBJECT PLACE INSTR. 
(' COOK ') (HUMAN) (EDIBLE/POTABLE) (HEATED) (WATER.) 
The partial description of the word boil gives the following infor- 
mation: that it is a member of the semantic field "cook "; that the agent 
must be a member of the semantic field" human"; that the thing boiled 
must be edible or potable; that the place the boiling is done must be 
heated (actually this information is redundant since the place for cook- 
ing must also be heated); and the instrument in which the boiling is 
done must be water. The symbol xx means that the object can be sub- 
ject if no agent is stated: 
Alice boiled the eggs. 
The eggs boiled quickly. 
The parentheses around the operators mean that the choice of place 
and instrument is optional. 
Using this model we can state relationships between derivational 
morphemes and nominalizations that have not as yet been stated in 
computerized lexicons. (Reliable is passively related to rely: "able to 
be relied on "; while comfortable is actively related to comfort: "able to 
comfort "). 
SUMMARY. Our purpose is to construct a 20,000 word core dic- 
tionary of English to be used in computerized natural anguage using 
systems. It is to include as much syntactico-semantic information as 
necessary to be used in most current heoretical frameworks both in 
318 RAOUL N. SMITH-  EDWARD MAXWELL 
sentence recognition and production as well as for linguistic studies 
of English syntax and semantics. 
We eventually would like to parse the definitions o that this in- 
formation can be put in some formal notation and used for further 
dictionary organization but we feel at the moment that our core-English 
dictionary must be pre-requisite o any such definition parsing (cf. O. 
WERNER, 1972 for a model to account for taxonomic relations deri- 
vable from definitions).
