Abstract 
We will demonstrate the MIT Spoken Lecture 
Processing Server and an accompanying lecture 
browser that students can use to quickly locate and 
browse lecture segments that apply to their query. 
We will show how lecturers can upload recorded 
lectures and companion text material to our server 
for automatic processing. The server automatically 
generates a time-aligned word transcript of the lec-
ture which can be downloaded for use within a 
browser. We will also demonstrate a browser we 
have created which allows students to quickly lo-
cate and browse audio segments that are relevant to 
their query. These tools can provide students with 
easier access to audio (or audio/visual) lectures, 
hopefully improving their educational experience. 
 
1 Introduction 
Over the past decade there has been increasing 
amounts of educational material being made avail-
able on-line. Projects such as MIT OpenCourse-
Ware provide continuous worldwide access to 
educational materials to help satisfy our collective 
thirst for knowledge. While the majority of such 
material is currently text-based, we are beginning 
to see dramatic increases in the amount of audio 
and visual recordings of lecture material. Unlike 
text materials, untranscribed audio data can be te-
dious to browse, making it difficult to utilize the 
information fully without time-consuming data 
preparation. Moreover, unlike some other forms of 
spoken communication such as telephone conver-
sations or television and radio broadcasts, lecture 
processing has until recently received little atten-
tion or benefit from the development of human 
language technology. The single biggest effort, to 
date, is on-going work in Japan using the Corpus 
of Spontaneous Japanese [1,3,4]. 
Lectures are particularly challenging for auto-
matic speech recognizers because the vocabulary 
used within a lecture can be very technical and 
specialized, yet the speaking style can be very 
spontaneous. As a result, even if parallel text mate-
rials are available in the form of textbooks or re-
lated papers, there are significant linguistic 
differences between written and oral communica-
tion styles. Thus, it is a challenge to predict how a 
written passage might be spoken, and vice versa. 
By helping to focus a research spotlight on spoken 
lecture material, we hope to begin to overcome 
these and many other fundamental issues. 
While audio-visual lecture processing will per-
haps be ultimately most useful, we have initially 
focused our attention on the problem of spoken 
lecture processing. Within this realm there are 
many challenging research issues pertaining to the 
development of effective automatic transcription, 
indexing, and summarization. For this project, our 
goals have been to a) help create a corpus of spo-
ken lecture material for the research community, b) 
analyze this corpus to better understand the lin-
guistic characteristics of spoken lectures, c) per-
form speech recognition and information retrieval 
experiments on these data to benchmark perform-
ance on these data, d) develop a prototype spoken 
lecture processing server that will allow educators 
to automatically annotate their recorded lecture 
data, and e) develop prototype software that will 
allow students to browse the resulting annotated 
lectures. 
2 Project Details 
As mentioned earlier, we have developed a web-
based Spoken Lecture Processing Server 
(http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/lectures) in which 
users can upload audio files for automatic tran-
scription and indexing. In our work, we have ex-
28
perimented with collecting audio data using a 
small personal digital audio recorder (an iRiver 
N10). To help the speech recognizer, users can 
provide their own supplemental text files, such as 
journal articles, book chapters, etc., which can be 
used to adapt the language model and vocabulary 
of the system.  Currently, the key steps of the tran-
scription process are as follows: a) adapt a topic-
independent vocabulary and language model using 
any supplemental text materials, b) automatically 
segment the audio file into short chunks of pause-
delineated speech, and c) automatically annotate 
these chunks using a speech recognition system. 
Language model adaptation is performed is two 
steps. First the vocabulary of any supplemental text 
material is extracted and added to an existing 
topic-independent vocabulary of nearly 17K 
words. Next, the recognizer merges topic-
independent word sequence statistics from an 
existing corpus of lecture material with the topic-
dependent statistics of the supplemental material to 
create a topic-adapted language model. 
The segmentation algorithm is performed in two 
steps. First the audio file is arbitrarily broken into 
10-second chunks for speech detection processing 
using an efficient speaker-independent phonetic 
recognizer. To help improve its speech detection 
accuracy, this recognizer contains models for non-
lexical artifacts such as laughs and coughs as well 
as a variety of other noises. Contiguous regions of 
speech are identified from the phonetic recognition 
output (typically 6 to 8 second segments of speech) 
and passed alone to our speech recognizer for 
automatic transcription. The speech segmentation 
and transcription steps are currently performed in a 
distributed fashion over a bank of computation 
servers. Once recognition is completed, the audio 
data is indexed (based on the recognition output) in 
preparation for browsing by the user. 
The lecture browser provides a graphical user in-
terface to one or more automatically transcribed 
lectures. A user can type a text query to the 
browser and receive a list of hits within the in-
dexed lectures. When a hit is selected, it is shown 
in the context of the lecture transcription. The user 
can adjust the duration of context preceding and 
following the hit, navigate to and from the preced-
ing and following parts of the lecture, and listen to 
the displayed segment. Orthographic segments are 
highlighted as they are played. 
 
3 Experimental Results 
To date we have collected and analyzed a corpus 
of approximately 300 hours of audio lectures in-
cluding 6 full MIT courses and 80 hours of semi-
nars from the MIT World web site [2]. We are 
currently in the process of expanding this corpus. 
From manual transcriptions we have generated and 
verified time-aligned transcriptions for 169 hours 
of our corpus, and we are in the process of time-
aligning transcriptions for the remainder of our 
corpus.  
We have performed initial speech recognition 
experiments using 10 computer science lectures. In 
these experiments we have discovered that, despite 
high word error rates (in the area of 40%), retrieval 
of short audio segments containing important key-
words and phrases can be performed with a high-
degree of reliability (over 90% F-measure when 
examining precision and recall results) [5]. These 
results are similar in nature to the findings in the 
SpeechBot project (which performs a similar ser-
vice for online broadcast news archives) [6].
