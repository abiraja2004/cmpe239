Abstract 
Achieving guideline-based targets in patients 
with diabetes is crucial for improving clinical 
outcomes and preventing long-term complica-
tions. Using electronic heath records (EHRs) to 
identify high-risk patients for further interven-
tion by screening large populations is limited be-
cause many EHRs store clinical information as 
dictated and transcribed free text notes that are 
not amenable to statistical analysis.  This paper 
presents the process of extracting elements 
needed for generating a diabetes report card from 
free text notes written in English. Numerical 
measurements, representing lab values and phys-
ical examinations results are extracted from free 
text documents and then stored in a structured 
database. Extracting diagnosis information and 
medication lists are work in progress. The com-
plete dataset for this project is comprised of 
81,932 documents from 30,459 patients collected 
over a period of 5 years. The patient population 
is considered high risk for diabetes as they have 
existing cardiovascular complications. Experi-
mental results validate our method, demonstrat-
ing high precision (88.8-100%).    
 
1 Introduction 
A standard practice for care providers is to record 
patient consults using voice dictation. The voice 
dictation record is transcribed into free text and 
stored electronically. The nature of this text is 
narrative with a possibility of containing headings 
marking the boundaries of the paragraphs. This 
remains the medium of choice for storing key pa-
tient information as opposed to structured tables 
due to time constraints, uncertainty about the use 
of codes, classification limitations, and difficulty 
with the use of computer systems. The information 
being stored in machine readable format is not 
amenable to any form of statistical analysis or re-
view as it exists (Mcdonald 1997, Lovis et al 
2000). The usefulness of mining information from 
this text has been stressed by many including 
Heinze et al (2001) and Hripcsak et al (1995). 
The information unlocked from the free text could 
be used for facilitating patient management, re-
searching disease symptoms, analyzing diagnoses, 
epidemiological research, book keeping, etc. The 
free text in these documents has been shown to be 
less ambiguous than text in general unrestricted 
documents (Ruch et al 2001) making it feasible to 
successfully apply extraction techniques using 
tools from IE and NLP. Natural language 
processing has been used to analyze free text in  
8
medical domain for decision support (Chapman et 
al. 2005), classifying medical problem lists 
(Meystre and Haug 2005), extracting disease re-
lated information (Xu et al 2004), building dy-
namic medications lists (Pakhomov et al 2002), 
building applications for better data management, 
and for diagnosis detection. (Friedman et al 2004, 
Roberts et al 2008,  Liu and Friedman 2004).    
Our goal is to automatically generate diabetes 
report cards from the free text in physicians' letters. 
The report card can be used to detect populations 
at risk for diabetes mellitus and track their vital 
information over a period of time. Previous work 
in similar area has seen Turchin et al (2005) iden-
tify patients with diabetes from the text of physi-
cian notes by looking for mention of diabetes and 
predefined list of medication names. They use a 
manually created list of negation tokens to detect 
false examples. They compare the process to ma-
nual chart review and billing notes and show the 
automatic system performs at par with manual re-
view with the advantage of it being highly effi-
cient. 
In Turchin et al (2006) the authors use regular 
expressions to extract blood pressure values and 
change of treatment for hypertension. They use a 
set of regular expressions to detect the presence of 
a blood pressure related tag, which predicts that the 
sentence is likely to contain a blood pressure value. 
The value itself is then extracted using regular ex-
pressions. They identify the strength of the process 
in it being relatively simple, efficient and quick to 
setup, while its weakness is its lack of generaliza-
tion. Voorham and Denig (2007) solve a similar 
problem as in here and extract information regard-
ing diabetes from free text notes using a number 
centric approach. They identify all positive numer-
ical values and then attach respective labels to the 
values. They use a keyword based approach with a 
four word token window and apply a character se-
quence algorithm to check for spelling errors. 
Extracting relevant information from free text 
represents a challenging problem since the task can 
be considered to be a form of reverse engineering 
and is above the mere presence of keywords or 
patterns. It is necessary to generate semantic repre-
sentations to understand the text. The free text 
document may contain multiple values for the 
same label, and it's important to be able to distin-
guish and choose the correct value. These values 
could be: 
 
? multiple readings (in which case a prede-
fined rule may be enough, e.g. choosing the 
smallest mean arterial blood pressure value) 
? potential target values (which may or may 
not be important) 
? values taken over a period of time 
? values taken at different locations 
? values reflecting family history 
? change in a value and not the actual value 
? values influenced by some external reasons 
(e.g. take medication if the weight is above 
a certain value).  
 
Friedman and Hripcsak (1999) discuss some of 
the many problems of dealing with free text in 
medical domain. One method to resolve these 
problems is to build a full grammar tree and assign 
semantic roles to accurately interpret the text. 
However, generating full parse trees for medical 
text requires specialized parsers developed for the 
clinical domain (Freidman, 2005). It has been 
shown that shallow syntactic approaches can yield 
similar results to the ones using full syntactic de-
tails (Gildea & Palmer, 2002).  
In this work we use shallow syntactic and se-
mantic features (manually created concept list and 
WordNet, Miller 1995) to tag information relating 
to the numerical values extracted from the text. We 
use machine learning tool WEKA (Hall et al  
2009) to build binary classifiers that pick positive 
values from the list of values extracted from the 
document. Our method allows us to build a robust 
and extendible system which should be easily port-
able to texts from different institutions and other 
medical domains. 
2 Method 
Our method extends Voorham's work in using the 
numeric value centered approach while developing 
a robust way to disambiguate between multiple 
values in the same document. The information ex-
tracted for the report card is divided into four cate-
gories: demographic information, numerical 
measurement values, medication list, and diagnos-
es. We currently have access to only one source of 
information, the free text in physicians' notes, 
hence all of the information needed for the report 
card is extracted from these notes.  The extraction 
of demographic information is achieved using reg-
9
ular expressions/pattern matching based tech-
niques. The demographic information extracted is 
year of birth, date of encounter and gender. The 
gender information is determined using a heuristic, 
which counts the number of third person masculine 
and feminine pronouns present in the text. Numeri-
cal measurement values extracted include blood 
pressure (systolic and diastolic), LDL, HDL, 
HbA1C, weight, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, 
glucose (unspecified) and creatinine. The medica-
tion list extraction process uses a manually created 
database of applicable medications. The diagnosis 
detection involves negation detection in the sen-
tences that mention diabetes using the NegEx algo-
rithm (Chapman et al 2001).  
In this study we use shallow syntactic and se-
mantic attributes to build a system that extracts the 
physical examination and laboratory results data. 
The values are extracted as numeric value-label 
pairs.  The system is divided into three main parts 
(Figure 1): preprocessing stage, extraction of the 
numeric value-label pairs, and testing the validity 
of the extracted pairs.  
Preprocessing: The documents were originally 
stored in Microsoft Word format (WordML). They 
are converted to XML using XSLT transformation. 
All formatting information is stripped except for 
bold and italic font information and paragraph 
boundaries 
The paragraphs in the document are further 
broken down into sentences and tokens. We use 
OPENNLP Maxent1 library to do sentence boun-
dary detection and tokenization. OPENNLP Max-
ent is based on maximum entropy algorithms 
described in Ratnaparkhi (1998) and Berger et al 
(1996). The OPENNLP statistical tagger is used to 
assign syntactic tags to the tokens.  
Data Extraction: In this phase the system extracts 
all potential numerical values and assigns them 
labels. The system loops through all of the tokens 
in the document, testing for numerical values. It 
tests each numerical token against a set of regular 
expressions and assigns them a list of potential 
labels based on the regular expression it matches. 
The system takes into account the presence of a 
measurement unit and revises the potential list of 
labels based on the unit. For each potential label, 
using a knowledge base, the system looks for con-
cepts that validate the labels. The closest possible

validation is accepted as pairing. The Edit distance 
algorithm is used to test for matching concepts in 
order to account for any spelling errors. The con-
cepts are searched within the constraints of the sen-
tence. 
 
 
Figure 1 Process Flow diagram for the extraction 
process 
 
In case multiple labels are validated because of the 
presence of multiple concepts in the same sen-
tence, the label indicated by the closest concept is 
selected. For each pair, the system extracts a list of 
features which help to resolve for positive values. 
One exception to the sentence level boundary rule 
is: if no concepts are found in the sentence, and the 
sentence contains a third person singular inanimate 
pronoun, the search is extended to the previous 
sentence. 
Testing Validity: The previous step extracts all 
possible label-numeric value pairs. As discussed 
earlier not all values are valid or of interest. In or-
der to select positive values, binary classifiers were 
built for each label. The dataset used for training 
consisted of 900 documents (210 patients).  The 
J48 (decision trees 4.5) and NBTree (Na?ve Bayes 
decision trees) algorithms in WEKA were used to 
generate the machine learning classifiers. 
10
Features: The following is the list of features ex-
tracted for each pair.  
a) Absolute distance between the label and the 
numerical value. 
b) Label shared (Yes/No): Yes, if the same con-
cept label is attached to another numerical val-
ue in the same document. 
c) Closest verb token appearing left of the numer-
ical value. 
d) Presence of a modal verb (Yes/No) 
e) Distance of numerical value from the modal 
verb (a positive value is assigned for the modal 
verb if it occurs before the numeric token, and 
a negative value when it appears after).  
f) Conjunction present (Yes/No): If there is con-
junction present between the label and numeri-
cal value or not. 
g) Coreference present (Yes/No): If third person 
singular inanimate pronoun is present or not. 
h) Negation concept present (Yes/No): True if 
there is any negation concept present in the vi-
cinity of the numerical value/label. The nega-
tion concepts include not just negative 
statement markers, but also false cognates and 
other concepts collected by the domain ex-
perts.  (e.g. systolic murmur or systolic volume 
do not indicate systolic pressure). 
i) Locational Information token: The stemmed 
token is stored if it is recognized as a location-
al information token. The location information 
is deduced by generalizing each token and 
checking to see whether it resolves to one of 
many Locational cues in WordNet. The list of 
location indicators is presented in Figure 2. 
The cues are resolved against the WordNet 
hypernym definitions for that token. 
j) Distance of numerical value from Locational 
token. 
k) Temporal information token: Similar to (i), the 
stemmed token indicating temporal informa-
tion. The temporal information token includes 
any tokens that indicate date or time. The list 
of temporal indicator cues in WordNet is 
shown in Figure 2. 
l) Distance of the numerical value from the tem-
poral token. 
 
For features (c), (i) and (k) the tokens are stored in 
their uninflected form, achieved using Porter 
Stemmer. For the report card, in case of multiple 
positive values for the same label, the smallest val-
ue is selected. In the case of blood pressure, the 
smallest mean arterial pressure is selected.

3 Evaluation 
Evaluation was done using a test set consisting of 
804 documents from 260 patients (50 percent had 
positive diagnosis for diabetes). The test set was 
created by a first year student at Michael G De-
groote School of Medicine at McMaster Universi-
ty. The reviewer manually analyzed the notes and 
extracted final values that would appear on the re-
port card along with a time stamp for each value to 
indicate the source document. The human reviewer 
took approximately 10 minutes per patient; in 
comparison the computer analyzed the data at 6.43 
patients per minute.  
Evaluation results testing the performance of 
the system using the manually coded test set are 
shown in Table 1 below.

4 Results and Discussion 
The precision, recall and f-measure for all nine 
label values extracted for the system along with the 
recall values for the human reviewer are listed in 
Table 1. The system demonstrates high precision in 
extracting and selecting positive numeric value-
label pairs. Blood pressure is extracted with a pre-
cision of 98.2% and recall 96.9%. HDL and LDL 
values are easy to spot and extract as they usually 
occur without description. At the lower end of pre-
cision are fasting glucose, glucose and HbA1C 
where precision results are in the range of 88-90%. 
The majority of errors for all categories occurred 
due to problems in identifying numeric values be-
cause of typing errors.  
Figure 3 shows an example of the level of com-
plexity resolved using the algorithm developed 
here. The clinical documents frequently have mul-
tiple values for weight and blood pressure in a sin-
gle document. The lab values do not have the same 
level of multiplicity but it can occur. In this exam-
ple, the extraction step extracts all five values, and 
the classifier successfully rejects values #3 and #5. 
To comply with the report card?s output require-
ments the lowest mean arterial pressure of the re-
maining three values is adopted, which is the 
correct response. This approach is extendible to 
build a slot-filler system for the values, which 
would allow the system to reason on its choice.  
In previous work, the disambiguation of the 
values is only based on the presence of negation 
concepts within a pre-specified boundary. We ex-
tend this to include a simple need based co-
reference, location and temporal information, and a 
heuristic approach to include the head verb (it only 
takes into account the closest verb, which may or 
may not be the governing verb).  The system can 
successfully detect negative values such as target 
values, previous values, change in value or values 
measured elsewhere.  
The information extracted is stored in a struc-
tured MySQL database. The system allows mul-
tiple views on this information. Figure 4 shows the 
output for blood pressure and creatinine for a pa-
tient that was created from the information ex-
tracted from the free text.  
 
 
Figure 3 Example 1  
 
At this time we have not evaluated the contribu-
tion of each feature individually, as this requires 
building a comprehensive test set; it remains as 
future work.  
5 Conclusion 
Our preliminary results demonstrate that the sys-
tem performs with high precision and recall at the 
task of extracting numerical values. It also shows 
the ability to build a patient-chart abstractor within 
the restricted domain.  The use of semantic and 
syntactic features enables the system to tag the 
values which permit the overall extraction process 
to generate more informative numeric value-label 
pairs. The use of machine learning algorithms 
coupled with a large enough learning dataset pro-
duces a robust system that should work reliably on 
similar data from any source. We plan to test the 
system on a dataset obtained from the free text 
notes of endocrinologists at a different health insti-
tution to validate the generalization of the algo-
rithm. The next step for the Diabetes Report Card 
is to extract the list of medications and track any 
changes in medication, dosage and frequency.
