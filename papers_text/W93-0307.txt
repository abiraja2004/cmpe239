ABSTRACT 
Lexical co-occurrence statistics are becoming widely used 
in the syntactic analysis of unconstrained text. However, anal- 
yses based solely on lexical relationships suffer from sparse- 
ness of data: it is sometimes necessary to use a less informed 
model in order to reliably estimate statistical parameters. For 
example, the "lexical association" strategy for resolving am- 
biguous prepositional phrase attachments \[Hindle and Rooth. 
1991\] takes into account only the attachment si e (a verb or its 
direct object) and the preposition, ignoring the object of the 
preposition. 
We investigated an extension of the lexical association strat- 
egy to make use of noun class information, thus permitting a
disambiguation strategy to take more information i to account. 
Although in preliminary experiments he extended strategy did 
not yield improved performance over lexical association alone. 
a qualitative analysis of the results suggests that the problem 
lies not in the noun class information, but rather in the multi- 
plicity of classes available for each noun in the absence of sense 
disambiguation. This suggests several possible revisions of our 
proposal. 
1. P re ference  St ra teg ies  
Prepositional phrase attachment is a paradigmatic case 
of the structural ambiguity problems faced by natural lan- 
guage parsing systems. Most models of grammar will not 
constrain the analysis of such attachments in examples 
like (1): the grammar simply specifies that a preposi- 
tional phrase such as on computer theft can be attached 
in several ways, and leaves the problem of selecting the 
correct choice to some other process.

yses given combinations of such "all ways ambiguous" 
constructions grows rapidly even for sentences of quite

reasonable ngth, so this other process has an important 
role to play. 
Discussions of sentence processing have focused pri- 
marily on structurally-based preference strategies uch 
as right association and minimal attachment \[Kimball, 
1973; Frazier, 1979; Ford et al, 1982\]; \[Hobbs and Bear, 
1990\], while acknowledging the importance of seman- 
tics and pragmatics in attachment decisions, propose two 
syntactically-based attachment rules that are meant o be 
generalizations of those structural strategies. 
Others, however, have argued that syntactic onsider- 
ations alone are insumcient for determining prepositional 
phrase attachments, suggesting instead that preference r - 
lationships among lexical items are the crucial factor. For 
example: 
\[Wilks et aL, 1985\] argue that the right attachment 
rules posited by \[Frazier, 1979\] are incorrect for 
phrases in general, and supply counterexarnples. 
They further argue that lexical preferences alone as 
suggested by \[Ford et al, 1982\] are too simplistic, 
and suggest instad the use of preference semantics. 
In the preference semantics framework, attachment 
relations of phrases are determined by comparing the 
preferences manating from all the entities involved 
in the attachment, until the best mutual fit is found. 
Their CASSEX system represents he various mean- 
ings of the preposition in terms of (a) the preferred 
semantic lass of the noun or verb that proceeds the 
preposition (e.g., move, be, strike), (b) the case of the 
preposition (e.g., instrument, time, loc.static), and 
(c) the preferred semantic lass of the head noun of 
the prepositional phrase (e.g., physob, event). The 
difficult part of this method is the identification of 
preference relationships and particularly determin- 
ing the strengths of the preferences and how they 
should interact. (See also discussion in \[Schubert, 
19841.) 
lDahlgren and McDowell, 1986\] also suggests using 
preferences based on hand-built knowledge about 
the prepositions and their objects, specifying asim- 
pler set of rules than those of \[Wilks et al, 1985\]. 
58 
She argues that the knowledge is needed lot un- 
derstanding the text as well as for parsing it. Like 
CASSE.X, this system requires considerable ffort 
to provide hand-encoded preference information. 
? \[Jensen and Binot, 1987\] resolve prepositional 
phrase attachments by using preferences obtained 
by applying aset of heuristic rules to dictionary def- 
initions. The rules match against lexico-syntactic 
patterns in the definitions - -  for example, if con- 
fronted with the sentence She ate a fish with a fork, 
the system evaluates eparately the plausibility of 
the two proposed constructs eat with fork and fish 
with fork based on how well the dictionary supports 
each. By making use of on-line dictionaries, the 
authors hope to create a system that will scale up; 
however, they report no overall evaluation. 
An empirical study by \[Whittemore eta/., 1990\] sup- 
ports the main premise of these proposals: they observe 
that in naturally-occurring data, lexical preferences (e.g., 
arrive at, flight to) provide more reliable attachment 
predictions than structural strategies. Unfortunately, it 
seems clear that, outside of restricted omains, hand- 
encoding of preference rules will not suffice for uncon- 
strained text. Information gleaned from dictionaries may 
provide a solution, but the problem of how to weight and 
combine preferences remains. 
2. Lex iea l  Assoc ia t ion  
\[Hindle and Rooth, 1991\] offer an alternative method 
for discovering and using lexical attachment preferences, 
based on corpus-based lexical co-occurrence statistics. 
In this section, we briefly summarize their proposal and 
experimental results. 
An "instance" of ambiguous prepositional phrase at- 
tachment is taken to consist of a verb, its direct object, 
a preposition, and the object of the preposition. Further- 
more, only the heads of the respective phrases are consid- 
ered; so, for example, the ambiguous attachment in (1) 
would be construed as the 4-tuple (brief, officer,on,theft). 1 
We will refer to its elements as v, n 1, p, and n2, respec- 
tively. 
The attachment s rategy is based on an assessment of
bow likely the preposition is, given each potential attach- 
ment site; that is, a comparison of the values Pr(/,inl) 
and Pr(p\[v). For (1), one would expect Pr(on\[bri~f) 
to be greater than Pr(on\[o~fficer), eflecting the intuition 
that briefX on Y is more plausible as a verb phrase than 
o.~icer on Z is as a noun phrase. 
Hindle and Rooth extracted their training data from a 
corpus of Associated Press news stories. A robust parser 
! Verbs aad nou~xr?  reduced to their root form, F, hence officerrather 
than o~cen. 
\[Hindle, 1983\] was used to construct a table in which 
each row contains the head noun of each noun phrase, the 
preceding verb (if the noun phrase was the verb's direct 
object), and the following preposition, if any occurred. 
Attachment decisions for the training data in the table 
were then made using a heuristic procedure - -  for ex- 
ample, given spare it from, the procedure will count this 
row as an instance of spare from rather than it from, since 
a prepositional phrase cannot be attached to a pronoun. 
Not all the data can be assigned with such certainty: am- 
biguous cases in the training data were handled either by 
using statistics collected from the unambiguous cases, by 
splitting the attachment between the noun and the verb, 
or by defaulting to attachment to the noun. 
Given an instance of ambiguous prepositional phrase 
attachment from the test set, the lexical association pro- 
cedure for guessing attachments u ed the t-score \[Church 
et aL, 1991\] to assess the direction and significance of 
the difference between Pr(p\[n 1) and Pr(plv) - -  t will be 
positive, zero, or negative according to whether Pr(pln 1) 
is greater, equal to, or less than Pr(plv), respectively, 
and its magnitude indicates the level of confidence in the 
significance of this difference. 
On a set of test sentences held out from the training 
data, the lexical association procedure made the correct 
attachment 78.3% of the time. For choices with a high 
level of confidence (magnitude of t greater than 2.1, about 
70% of the time), correct attachments were made 84.5% 
of the time. 
3. P repos i t iona l  Ob jec ts  
The lexical association strategy performs quite well, 
despite the fact that the object of the preposition is ig- 
nored. However, Hindle and Rooth note that neglecting 
this information can hurt in some cases. For instance, 
the lexical association strategy is presented with exactly 
the same information in (2a) and (2b), and is therefore 
unable to distinguish them. 
(2) a. Britain reopened its embassy in December. 
b. Britain reopened its embassy in Teheran. 
In addition, \[Hearst and Church, in preparation\] have con- 
ducted a pilot study in which human subjects are asked to 
guess prepositional phrase attachments despite the omis- 
sion of the direct object, the object of the preposition, 
or both. The results of this study, though preliminary, 
suggest hat the object of the preposition contributes an 
amount of information comparable tothat contributed by 
the direct object; more important, for some prepositions, 
the object of the preposition appears to be more informa- 
tive. 
Thus, there appears to be good reason to incorporate 
the object of the preposition i lexicai association calcula- 
tions. The difficulty, of course, is that the data are far too 
59 
sparse to permit he most obvious extension. Attempts to 
simply compare Pr(p, n21nl) against Pr(p, n21v) using 
the t-score fail dismally? 
4. Word  C lasses 
We are faced with a well-known tradeoff: increas- 
ing the number of words attended to by a statistical lan- 
guage model will in general tend to increase its accuracy, 
but doing so increases the number of probabilities to be 
estimated, leading to the need for larger (and often im- 
'practically larger) sets of training data in order to obtain 
accurate stimates. One option is simply to pay attention 
to fewer words, as do Hindle and Rooth. Another possi- 
bility, however, is to reduce the number of parameters by 
grouping words into equivalence classes, as discussed, 
for example, by \[Brown et al, 1990\]. 
\[Resnik, 1992\] discusses the use of word classes 
in discovering lexical relationships, demonstrating that 
WordNet \[Beckwith et al, 1991; Miller, 1990\], abroad- 
coverage, hand-constructed l xical database, provides a 
reasonable foundation upon which to build class-based 
statistical algorithms. Here we briefly describe WordNet, 
and in the following section describe its use in resolving 
prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. 
WordNet is a large lexical database organized as a set 
of word taxonomies, one for each of four parts of speech 
(noun, verb, adjective, and adverb). In the noun taxon- 
omy, the only one used here, each word is mapped to a set 
of word classes, corresponding roughly to word senses, 
which Miller et al term synonym sets. For example, the 
word paper is a member of synonym sets \[newspaper, pa. 
per\] and \[composition, paper, report, theme\], among oth- 
ers. For notational convenience, we will refer to each 
synonym set by its first word, sometimes together with a 
unique identifier - -  for example (paper, 2241323 ) and 
(newspaper, 2202048).3 
The classes in the taxonomy form the nodes of a 
semantic network, with links to superordinates, subor- 
dinates, antonyms, members, parts, etc. In this work 
only the superordinate/subordinate (i.e., IS-A) links are 
used w for example, (newspaper ,  2202048)  is a sub- 
class of (press,2200204),  which is a subclass of 
(print.media, 2200360), and so forth. 
Denoting the set of words subsumed by a class c (that 
is, the set of all words that are a member of c or any 
subordinate class) as words(c), the frequency of a class 
can be estimated as follows: 
f(c)---- ~ /(n) (I) 
.ewo.t,(c) 
2This experiment was attempted using expected likelihood esti- 
mates, as in \[Hindle and Rooth, 1991l, with data extracted from the 
Penn Treebank as dem:ribed below. 
3These identifiers differ depending upon the version of WordNet 
used; the wock desaribed inthis paper was done using version 1.2. 
Owing to multiple inheritance and word sense ambiguity, 
equation (1) represents only a coarse estimate - -  for ex- 
ample, each occurrence of a word contributes equally to 
the count of all classes of which it is a member. However, 
\[Resnik, 1992\] estimated class frequencies in a similar 
fashion with acceptable r sults. 
5. Conceptua l  Assoc ia t ion  
In what follows, we propose to extend Hindle and 
Rooth's lexical association method to take advantage of 
knowledge about word-class memberships, following a 
strategy one might call conceptual association. From a 
practical point of view, the use of word classes reduces 
the sparseness ofthe training data, permitting us to make 
use of the object of the preposition, and also decreases 
the sensitivity of the attachment s rategy to the specifics 
of the training corpus. From a more philosophical point 
of view, using a strategy based on conceptual rather than 
purely lexical relationships accords with our intuition 
that, at least in many cases, much of the work clone by 
lexical statistics is a result of the semantic relationships 
they indirectly encode. 
Our proposal for conceptual ssociation is to calculate 
a measure of association using the classes to which the 
direct object and object of the preposition belong, and 
to select the attachment site for which the evidence of 
association is strongest. The use of classes introduces 
two sources of ambiguity. The first, shared by lexical 
association, is word sense ambiguity: just as lexically- 
based methods conflate multiple senses of a word into the 
count of a single token, here each word may be mapped 
to many different classes in the WordNet axonomy. Sec- 
ond, even for a single sense, a word may be classified 
at many levels of abstraction - - for example, even inter- 
preted solely as a physical object (ratber than a monetary 
unit),penny may be categorized as a (coin,  3566679), 
(cash,3566144), (money, 3565439), and SO forth on 
up to (possession, 11572 ). 
In our experiments, we adopted the simplest possible 
approach: we consider each classification of the nouns 
as a source of evidence about association, and combine 
these sources of evidence to reach a single attachment 
decision. 
Algorithm 1. Given (v, nl ,  p, n2), 
I. Let C1 = {c J nl E words(c)} 
Let C2 = {c \] n2 E words(c)} = {c2.1 ..... c2.N} 
2. For i from l to N, 
cl,i = argmax l(c; p, c2.i) 
c?C1 
I F = I(cl,i;p, C2,i ) 
60 
I~' = I(v;p, c2,i) 
3. For i from 1 to N, 
= freq(el,~, r', c2,i) I~ 
= freq(v,r,, e2,~) I~ 
4. Compute apaired samples t-test for a difference of 
the means of ,5"' and S ~ . Let "confidence" be the 
significance of the test with N - 1 degrees of 
freedom. 
5. Select attachment tonl or v according to whether t 
is positive or negative, respectively. 
Step 1 of the algorithm establishes the range of pos- 
sible classifications for nl and n2. For example, if the 
algorithm is trying to disambiguate 
(3) But they foresee little substantial progress in 
exports... 
the word export can be classified alter- 
natively as (export, 248913), (commerce, 244370), 
(group_action, 241055), and (act, 10812). 
In step 2, each candidate classification for n2 is held 
fixed, and a classification for n l is chosen that maxi- 
rnizes the association (as measured by mutual informa- 
tion) between the noun-attachment site and the preposi- 
tional phrase. In effect, this answers the question, "If we 
were to categorize n2 in this way, what would be the best 
class to use for niT'  This is done for each classification 
of n2, yielding N different class-based interpretations for 
(nl,p,n2). I~ is the noun-attachment association score 
for the ith interpretation. Correspondingly, there are N 
interpretations 1~' for (v,p,n2). 
At this point, each of the N classifications for nl 
(progress) and n2 (export) provides one possible interpre- 
tation of (foresee,progress,in,export), and each of these 
interpretations provides associational evidence in favor 
of one attachment choice or the other. How are these 
sources of evidence to be combined? 
As a first effort, we have proceeded as follows. Each 
of the values for I/~ and I/' are not equally reliable: val- 
ues calculated using classes low in the taxonomy involve 
lower frequencies than those using higher-level classes. 
In an attempt to assign more credit to scores calculated 
using higher counts, we weight each of the mutual infor- 
marion scores by the corresponding trigram frequency 
thus in step 3 the association score for noun-attachment 
is calculated as the product of f(el,i, P, e2,i) I~. The cor- 
responding verb-attachment score is f(v, p, c2.~) I~'. This 
leaves us with a table like the following: 
J s ;  I 
(situation} in (exp,z, rt } 67.4 39.8 
(rise) in (commerce) 178.3 23.8 
(advance) in (group_at=ion) 104.9 19"9 I
(advance) in (act) 149.5 40.6 J 
In step 4 the N different sources of evidence are com- 
bined: a t.test for the difference of the means is per- 
formed, treating ~ and S" as paired samples (see, e.g., 
\[Woods et al, 1986\]). In step 5 the resulting value of t 
determines the choice of attachment si e, as well as an es- 
timate of how significant the difference isbetween the two 
alternatives. (For this example, t(3) = 3.57,p < 0.05, 
yielding the correct choice of attachment.) 
6. Combin ing  S t ra teg ies  
In addition to evaluating the performance of the con- 
ceptual association strategy in isolation, it is natural to 
combine the predictions of the lexical and conceptual s- 
sociation strategies to make a single prediction. Although 
well-founded strategies for combining the predictions of 
multiple models do exist in the speech recognition liter- 
ature \[Jelinek and Mercer, 1980; Katz, 1987\], we have 
chosen a simpler "backing off"' style procedure: 
Algorithm 2. Given (v, nl, p, n2), 
1. Calculate an attachment decision using 
Algorithm 1. 
2. If significance < 0.1, use this decision, 
3. Otherwise, use iexical association. 
7. Exper imenta l  Resu l ts  
7.1. Exper iment  1 
An experiment was conducted to evaluate the perfor- 
mance of the lexical association, conceptual ssociation, 
and combined strategies. The corpus used was a collec- 
tion of parses from articles in the 1988-89 Wall Street 
Journal, found as part of the Penn Treebank. This corpus 
is an order of magnitude smaller than the one used by 
Hindle and Rooth in their experiments, but it provides 
considerably ess noisy data, since attachment decisions 
have been performed automatically b  the Fidditch parser 
\[Hindle, 1983\] and then corrected by hand. 
A test set of 201 ambiguous prepositional phrase at- 
tachment instances was set aside. After acquiring attach- 
ment choices on these instances from a separate judge 
(who used the full sentence context in each case), the test 
set was reduced by eliminating sentences for which the 
separate judge disagreed with the Treebank, leaving a test 
set of 174 instances. 4 
#Of the 348 nouns appearing a.~ part of the test set. 12 were not 
covered by WordNet ; these were clas.~ified by default L~ members of
file WordNet cl~?s (ant i ty, 23 ~ 3 ). 
61 
Lexical counts for relevant prepositional phrase at- 
tachments (v,p,n2 and nl,p,n2) were extracted from the 
parse trees in the corpus; in addition, by analogy with Hin- 
die and Rooth's training procedure, instances of verbs and 
nouns that did not have a prepositional phrase attached 
were counted as occurring with the "null prepositional 
phrase." A set of clean-up steps included reducing verbs 
and nouns to their root forms, mapping to lowercase, sub- 
stituting the word someone for nouns not in WordNet hat 
were part-of-speech-tagged as proper names, substituting 
the word amount for the token % (this appeared as a head 
noun in phrases uch as rose 10 %), and expanding month 
abbreviations such as Jan. to the full month name. 
The results of the experiment are as follows: 
I I ~ I c^ I ??MB~N~D I 
\[ %Correct \[ 81.6 \] 77.6 I 82.2 \] 
When the individual strategies were constrained to an- 
swer only when confident (Itl > 2.1 for lexical associa- 
tion, p <.  1 for conceptual association), they performed 
as follows: 
\[ sr~rvx~v \]ANSWERED (%) \] ACCURACY (%) \] 
I..A ,44.3 92.8 \[ 
t CA 67.2 84.6 
The performance of lexical association in this experi- 
ment is striking: despite the reduced size of the training 
corpus in comparison to \[Hindle and Rooth, 1991\], per- 
formance xceeds previous results ~ and although fewer 
test cases produce confident predictions (as might be ex- 
pected given generally lower counts), when the algorithm 
is confident it performs very well indeed. 
The performance of the conceptual association strat- 
egy seems reasonable, though it is clearly overshadowed 
by the performance of the lexical association strategy. 
The tiny improvement on lexical association by the com- 
bined strategy suggests that including the conceptual as- 
sociation strategy may improve performance overall, but 
further investigation is needed to determine whether such 
a conclusion is warranted; the experiments described in 
the following two sections bear on this issue. 
7.2. Experiment 2 
Although the particular class-based strategy imple- 
mented here might not provide great leaps in performance 
at least as judged on the basis of Experiment 1 
one might expect that a strategy based upon a domain- 
independent semantic taxonomy would provide a greater 
degree of robustness, reducing dependence of the attach- 
ment strategy on the training corpus. 
We set out to test this supposition by considering 
the performance of the various associational ttachment 
strategies when tested on data from a corpus other than 
the one on which they were trained. First, we tested per- 
formance on a test set drawn from the same genre. Of 
the test cases drawn by Hindle and Rooth from the As- 
sociated Press corpus, we took the first 200; eliminating 
those sentences for which Hindle and Rooth's two human 
judges could not agree on an attachment reduced the set 
to 173. Several minor clean-up steps were taken to make 
this test set consistent with our training data: if the object 
of the preposition was a complementizer o other word 
introducing a sentence (e.g. begin debate on whether), 
it was replaced with the word something; proper names 
(e.g. Bush) were replaced with someone; some numbers 
were replaced with year or atnount, (e.g. 1911 and 0, re- 
spectively); and "compound" prepositions were replaced 
by a "normal" preposition consistent with what appeared 
in the full sentence (e.g. by_about was replaced with by 
for the phrase oumumbered losers by about 6 to 5). 
The results of the experiment are as follows: 
\[ % Correct 169.9172.3172.8  \] 
When the individual strategies were constrained to an- 
swer only when confident: 
\[ STRATEGY \[ ANSWERED (%) ACCURACY (%) 
LA 31.8 80.0 
CA 49.7 77.9 
The conceptual association strategy, not being as de- 
pendent on the specific lexical items in the training and 
test sets, sustains a somewhat higher level of overall per- 
formance, although once again the lexical association 
strategy performs well when restricted to the relatively 
small set of predictions that it can make with confidence. 
7.3. Experiment 3 
Wishing to pursue the paradigm of cross-corpus test- 
ing further, we conducted a third experiment in which 
the training set was extracted from the Penn Treebank's 
parsed version of the Brown corpus \[Francis and Kucera, 
1982\], testing on the Wall Street Journal test set of Ex- 
periment 1. 
The results of the experiment are as follows: 
I I I c^ I 
I%Co~=t 177.6173.6179.3 I 
When the individual strategies were constrained to 
answer only when confident: 
I s ^rmv I ANSWERa, ACCUSer 
59.2 81.6 
62 
In this experiment it is surprising that all the strategies 
perform as well as they do. However, the pattern of re- 
sults leads us to conjecture that the conceptual ssociation 
strategy, taken in combination with the lexical associa- 
tion strategy, may permit us to make more effective use of 
general, corpus-independent semantic relationships than 
does the lexical association strategy alone. 
8. Qua l i ta t ive  Eva luat ion  
The overall performance ofthe conceptual ssociation 
strategy tends to be worse than that oflexical association, 
and the combined strategy ields at best a marginal im- 
provement. However, several comments are in order. 
First, the results in the previous ection demonstrate 
that conceptual ssociation isdoing some work: when the 
strategies are constrained to answer only when confident, 
conceptual association achieves a 50-60% increase in 
coverage over lexical association, at the cost of a 3-9% 
decrease in accuracy. 
Second, it is clear that class information is provid- 
ing some measure of resistance to sparseness of data. 
As mentioned earlier, adding the object of the preposi- 
tion without using noun classes leads to hopelessly sparse 
data - -  yet the performance ofthe conceptual ssociation 
strategy is far from hopeless. In addition, examination of 
what the conceptual association strategy actually did on 
specific examples shows that in many cases it is success- 
fully compensating for sparse data. 
(,4) To keep his schedule on track, he flies two 
personal secretaries in from Little Rock to 
augment his staff in Dallas, 
For example, verb augment and preposition i  never co- 
occur in the WSJ training corpus, and neither do noun 
staff and preposition i ; as a result, the lexical association 
strategy makes an incorrect choice for the ambiguous 
verb phrase in (,4). However, the conceptual ssociation 
strategy makes the correct decision on the basis of the- 
following classifications: 
augment . .  S" 
(gathering) in (dallas) 38.18 
.,(people} in (urban.area~ 
(personnel) in (region) 
. (personnel) in (geo..area) 
(people} in (city) 
(personnel) in (location)

314.62 
106.05

320.85 
45.54 
28.46 
23.38 
26.8o 
28.61 
22.83 
Third, mutual information appears to be a success- 
ful way to select appropriate classifications for the direct 
object, given a classification of the object of the prepo- 
sition (see step 2 in Algorithm 1). For example, de- 
spite the fact that staff belongs to 25 classes in WordNet 
- -  including ( rnus ica l _notat ion ,  23325281 and 
( rod ,  1613297),  for instance - -  the classes to which 
it assigned in the above table seem appropriate given the 
context of (4). 
Finally, it is clear that our method for combining 
sources of evidence - -  the paired t-test in step 4 of Al- 
gorithm 1 - -  is hurting performance in many instances 
because (a) it gives equal weight to likely and unlikely 
classifications of the object of the preposition, and (b) the 
significance of the test is overestimated when the object 
of the preposition belongs to many different classes. 
(5) Goodrich's vinyl-products segment reported 
operating pn~t for the quarter of $30. l mil- 
lion. 
For example, given the ambiguous attachment high- 
lighted in (5), the contribution of the time-related 
classifications ofquarter ((t ime_period, 4 0142 63), 
(ttrne, 9819), etc.) is swamped by numerous other 
classifications in which quttrter is interpreted as a physi- 
cal object (coin, animal part), a number (fraction, rational 
number), a unit of weight (for measuring rain), and so 
forth. As a result, the conceptual association strategy 
comes up with the wrong attachment and identifies its 
decision as a confident one.

The conceptual association strategy described here 
leaves room for a number of improvements. The use 
of mutual information as an association measure, and the 
weighting of the mutual information score in order to bias 
the computation i favor of large counts, warrant further 
consideration - - mutual information has been criticized 
for, among other things, its poor behavior given low fre- 
quencies, and an alternative measures of association may 
prove better. 
In addition, as noted in the previous section, com- 
bining evidence using the paired t-test is problematic, 
essentially because of word-sense ambiguity. One al- 
ternative might be to perform sense disambiguation i  
advance - -  the results of \[Yarowsky, 1993\] demonstrate 
that a significant reduction in the number of possible 
noun classifications i possible using only very limited 
syntactic ontext, rather than global word co-occurrence 
statistics. Another elated alternative would be to select a 
single best classification - -  for example, using the mea- 
sure of selectional ssociation proposed in \[Resnik, 1993\] 
- -  rather than considering all possible classifications. 
Another possibility to investigate is the incorporation 
of structurally-based attachment strategies along with 
lexical and conceptual association. Such a fusion of 
structural and iexical preference strategies i suggested in
\[Whittemore et al, 1990\], and \[Weischedel taL, 1989\] 
63  
have found that a structural strategy ("closest attach- 
ment") performs well in combination with a class-based 
strategy, although they use a relatively small, domain- 
specific taxonomy of classes and assume ach word has 
a pointer to a unique class. 
Still another direction for future work involves the 
application of similar techniques to other problems like 
prepositional phrase attachment for which the resolu- 
tion of ambiguities would seem to require some form 
of semantic knowledge. 'The problems discussed in 
\[Church and Patil, 1982\] - -  including ambiguous prepo- 
sitional phrase attachment, noun-noun modification, and 
coordination m would seem to form a natural class 
of problems to investigate in this manner. Although 
there will always be ambiguities that can be resolved 
only by appeal to complex inferences or highly domain- 
dependent facts, we believe the combination of domain- 
independent, knowledge-based resources uch as Word- 
Net with corpus-based statistics may provide the seman- 
tic power necessary for solving many instances of such 
problems, without the need for general reasoning about 
world knowledge.
