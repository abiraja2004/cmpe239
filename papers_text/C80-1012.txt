I. In t roduct ion  
When we look up l inguist ic  theor ies  
of sentence-  or even of text -semant ics  
to see what  they can offer  in respect  
to word -mean ing ,  we wi l l  be conf ronted 
with bas ica l ly  two types F ILLMORE /3/ 
has referred to as check l i s t - semant ics  
and proto type-semant ics .  Accord ing  to 
this d i s t inc t ion ,  check l i s t - semant ics  
provides l ist ings of mean ing  components ,  
semant ic  markers ,  or semant ic  descr ip -  
tors which must  be sat is f ied for a term 
to be (grammatical ly ,  t ru th - funct ion -  
al ly, or else) in terpretab le  w i th in  a 
l inguist ic  express ion;  whereas proto-  
type-semant ics  al lows for the (pa~g-  
ma~l ,  Syn{~agmatical, or else) iden- 
t i f icat ion of a term as part  of a 
l inguist ic  express ion  wi th in  a network  
st ructure of labeled nodes and re lat ions.  
Examin ing how these l ist ings and net-  
works are assembled,  i.e. quest ion ing  
from which sources and by what  proce-  
dures the data necessary  for their 
compos i t ion  were acquired,  we wi l l  
invar iab ly  come accross  the ind iv idual  
ana lysts ' ,  or group of analysts '  own 
assumedly  comprehens ive  and re l iab le  
knowledge of the wor ld and/or  the 
natura l  language system concerned.  In 
the major i ty  of cases,  these wi l l  not 
have been made access ib le  by inter-  
sub ject ive ly  def ined operat ions  but 
rather  by way of intu i t ive in t rospec-  
tion. In do ing so, l inguists  tend to 
make use of word -mean ing  instead of 
ana lys ing  it when they set up matr i ces  
for component ia l  analys is  or def ine  
semant ic  networks.  Apart  from tentat ive 
depar tures  wi th in  generat ive  semant ics  
or s tat i s t i ca l  indexing,  there have no 
operat iona l  procedures  yet  been dev ised 
for the semant ic  analys is  and descr ip -  
t ion of natura l  language terms as a 
resu l t  of which - when appl ied to 
natural  language d i scourse  - a lex ica l  
s t ructure may be obtained.  
Now, this is what  word -semant ics  
should and could do, and where exact ly  
the problems begin. 
2. Ep is tomology  
If we agree that l ingu is t ics  is, or 
at least  ought  to be, an empir ica l  
d i sc ip l ine ,  then the parad igm of empi -  
r ical  sc iences should be fo l lowed,  
a l though it needs mod i f i ca t ion  in v iew 
of the scope of natura l  language seman- 
tics. 
To adopt  the parad igm of empi r ica l  
sc iences for l inguist ic  research is 
tantamount  to at least  two postu lates :  
a) not  to re ly on ready-made theor ies 
or models  taken from another  domain,  
because these may be inadequate in 
respect  to the phenomena under in- 
vest igat ion;  and 
76 
b) not to rely on the introspective 
exploration of one's own knowledge 
and competence as the al legedly in- 
exhaustible datasource although va- 
luable initial ideas might be prod- 
uced that way. 
Instead, the investigation of lin- 
guistic problems in general, and 
that of word -semantics in particu- 
lar, should start with hypotheses 
formulated for continuous estimation 
and/or testing against observable data, 
then proceed to incorporate the find- 
ings tentatively in some prel iminary 
theoretical set up which finally may 
perhaps get formalized to become part 
of an encompassing theory. 
Within such a set up, the formal 
expressions which give an abstract re- 
presentation of the domain, and the 
numerical expressions which give a 
quantitative account of the ob- 
servable data, are normally to be 
complemented by correspondence rules. 
These allow for the operational 
interpretation of formal notations 
and theoretical constructs in terms 
of empirical methods of counting and 
measuring observable data. Linguistic 
theory has not been interested too 
much in developing correspondence 
rules of that kind so far /15/. 
Following the line of LABOV /9/ 
and LEECH /10/, prevail ing linguis- 
tic theory and linguistic semantics 
in particular is dominated by what 
has been called the " categorial 
view " According to it, l inguistic 
entities are at least implicit ly 
asserted to be discrete, invariant, 
qual itat ively distinct, conjunctively 
definable, and composed of atomic 
primes. Membership in categories, 
and relations of inclusion and ex- 
clusion among units and categories, 
are established by a deterministic 
type of rule that allows only for 
binary ( positive or negative ) or 
triple ( positive, negative, or op- 
tional ) assignment, but has no means 
to represent probable and/or possible 
degrees of transition. This type of 
rule - particularly when employed 
for meaning representation purposes 
- has come under severe crit icism 
from as seemingly disparate dis- 
ciplines like cognitive theory 
( e.g. / 12 / ) and experimental 
psychology ( e.g. /20/ ) , information 
and computer science ( e.g. /23/, /4/), 
psycholinguistics ( e.g. /16/, /11/) , 
sociol inguistics ( e.g. /8/, /7/, 
computational semantics ( e.g. /14/), 
and artif icial intell igence ( e.g. 
1221, 151) . 
From the increasing amount of strong 
empirical evidence piling, up in favour 
of some re-adjustment, a (meta-theore- 
tical) modif ication appears to be 
overdue. Accordingly, it may be argued 
that - contrary to the experimental ly 
and simulatively well established 
(object-theoretical) fuzziness of 
cognitive categorizing and its l inguis- 
tic correspondences - any formal re, 
presentation of it using only binary 
systems' notations wil l  inevitably re- 
sult in inadequately sharp-edged 
lattices. When imposed upon the varying 
and vague structures constituted and 
modif ied continuously during the process 
of verbal communication observed to be 
modelled, this will render formal re- 
presentations of discrete entities with 
clear-cut boundaries where blurred 
margins and continuous transitions 
would be adequate. 
The modif ications suggested so far 
may be summarized to concern both, the 
observable manifestat ion and/or formal 
representation of discourse, allowing 
gradual rather than abrupt transitions 
to account for imprecise phenomena in 
a precise way. This can be achieved, as 
I see it, formally by means of fuzzy set 
theoretical notations /24/, and opera- 
tionally by means of empirical proce- 
dures assigned to them /19/. Applied to 
natural language data, they wil l  inter- 
relate observable but essential ly fuzzy 
language phenomena on the one hand, and 
formal but finally categorial notations 
of their l inguistic descriptions on 
the other. 
Thus, findings and/or hypotheses on 
either side may become testable against 
each other, allowing for mutual modif i -  
cations in the course of gradual im- 
provement and increasing adequacy of 
the model and what it represents. 
3. Structure of Meaning 
What makes the analysis of natural 
language meaning so intricate a problem 
depends on the particular nature of 
what has to be represented as its re- 
sults, namely, a representational 
structure in its own. It is this re- 
presentational aspect of language 
which theories of semantics and cogni- 
tion have been, and still are focussed 
on in particular. 
According to the more traditional 
theories, natural language meaning can 
be characterized by its denotative and 
connotative aspects. Denotation is 
understood to constitute referential 
meaning as a system of relations 
between words or sentences of a 
--77 
language and the objects  or processes 
they refer  to. Connotat ion  is def ined 
to const i tute  structura l  meanings  as a 
system by which words or sentences of a 
language are conceptua l ly  re&ated to 
one another.  Referent ia l  semantic the- 
ory is t ruth- funct iona l  and formal ly  
e laborated but as such not prepared to 
account  sat i s factor i ly  for the vague-  
ness of natura l  language meaning;  
whereas  structura l  semant ics  has con-  
s idered vagueness  somewhat  fundamental  
of language but,  being based main ly  
upon intui t ive int rospect ion,  it has 
not achieved the theoret ica l  or me-  
thodologica l  cons is tency of formal 
theor ies.  
In the course of recent,  more pro-  
cedura l  approaches to cogni t ion and 
language comprehens ion ,  the former d is-  
t inct ion of referent ia l  and structura l  
meaning was embedded in what  became to 
be known as frame semant ics  /17/. The 
centra l  not ion of it is that of memory  
which serve as a paradigm for the op- 
erat ional  aspects  of both, wor ld sys- 
tem structures and language system 
structures.  The basic d i s t inc t ion  of 
what  may propos i t iona l ly  be formulated 
as opposed to what  may only prototyp i -  
ca l ly  be real ized in some system struc- 
ture of stored exper iences,  is re f lec-  
ted in the great  var ie ty  of not ional  
pair ings which d i f fe rent  d isc ip l ines  
have produced facing a s imi lar ,  if not 
ident ical  research problem. Thus, their 
not ions of formal vs. exper ient?a l  
knowledge /2/, semantic  vs. episodic  
memory  /21/, frame vs. scene /3/, 
descr ip t ion  vs. schema /I/, etc. show 
a str ik ing resemblance:  a l though their 
approaches d i f fer  in what  they con- 
sider natural  language meaning to be, 
they nontheless  converge on the centra l  
not ion of it, being a re lat ion between 
a representat ion  (i.e. the body of 
discourse) and that which it repre-  
sents (i.e. a re ferent ia l l y  and/or  
prototyp ica l ly  def ined system struc-  
ture). 
4. A formal approach 
It is this throughout  re lat iona l  
structure of meaning that obv ious ly  
a l lowed the concept of fuzzy sets and 
re lat ions to be employed to incorporate 
vagueness  into formal  theories of se- 
mant ics .  
The most  recent,  and at that most  
comprehens ive  approach (at least I 
know of) to tackle the problem of na- 
tural language meaning,  is that of L.A. 
Zadeh /24/. Under the acronym PRUF for 
'Possibi l ist ic ,  Re lat ional ,  Universal ,  
Fuzzy' he has devised a meaning repre-  
sentat ion language for natural  languages 
which is poss ib i l i s t i c  instead of truth-  
funct ional ,  and whose d ic t ionary  provides 
l ingu is t ica l ly  label led fuzzy subsets of 
the universe,  instead of sets of seman- 
tic markers  under word-headings .  
The basic idea, upon which this 
approach hinges, is that a re ferent ia l  
meaning may be exp l i cated  as a fuzzy 
cor respondence between language terms 
and a universe of d iscourse.  This corres-  
pondence, L, is formal ly  def ined to be a 
fuzzy b inary re lat ion from a set of 
language terms, T, to a universe of d is -  
course,  U. As a fuzzy relat ion,  L is 
character i zed  by a membersh ip - funct ion  
~L  : T x U -~ ~, I \ ]  ; x ~ T, z ~ U; 
O :~L(X ,Z)  ~ I (I) 
which assoc iates  with each ordered pair 
(x,z) its grade of membersh ip  ~L(X ,Z)  , 
being a numer ic  value between u ano I ,  
in L, so that 
L ,: {((x,z), CL(x,z))} <2) 
The fuzzy re lat ion L now induces a bi lat-  
eral  cor respondence accord ing to which 
a) the re ferenc ia l  meg ning of an e lement 
x' i~ T may be expl icated as the 
fuzzy subset  M(x') in U, ass igned to 
it by the membersh ip  funct ion ~L  
condi t ioned on x', 
M(x'):=,~L(Z,X'):= <((x',z 1),~n(x,zl)), 
.... ((X',Zn) , ~L(X ' ,Zn) )  > (3) 
b) the l inguist ic  descr ip t ion  of an 
e lement z' in U may be g iven as a 
fuzzy subset D(z') in T ass igned to 
it by the membersh ip  funct ion ~L  
condi t ioned on z' 
D(z'):=~(x,z'):: <((Xl,Z'),~L(Xl,Z'), 
? ..,((Xn,Z') , ~L(Xn ,Z ' ) )> (4) 
The def in i t ions  g iven in fuzzy sets 
theory for equal i ty ,  conta inment,  com- 
plement,  in tersect ion , and union a l low 
for an app l i cat ion  both,  to re ferent ia l  
meanings  M(x) as subsets of e lements in 
U and to l inguist ic  descr ip t ions  D(z) 
as subsets of uni ts  in T. This corres-  
ponds to the d is t inc t ion  between scenic, 
or conceptua l  re lat ions  on the one hand, 
and f rame,  or semantic  re lat ions on the 
other - the latter of which only wi l l  be 
introduced here. 
Thus, synonymy of two terms x ,x '~  T 
may be given as the equal i ty  of the two 
fuzzy subsets M(x) and M(x') repre-  
78 
senting the re ferent ia l  meaning in U 
X : X' iff ~L(Z ,X)= ~L(Z,X' )  
for all z (5) 
Part ia l  synonymy may be def ined by a 
s imi lar i ty  formula introducing some 
thresho ld -va lue  s 
x~ x' i f f l~L(Z,X) - ~L(Z,X')  & s 
for all z (6) 
Hyponymy of a term x re lat ive to x' may  
be expl icated as conta inment  of the 
meaning represent ing fuzzy sets con- 
cerned 
x~x'  iff~L(z,x) ~(z,x') 
for all z (7) 
In so far as the operat ions of comple-  
ment,  in tersect ion and un ion are con- 
cerned which cor respond to negat ion,  
con junct ion  and ad junct ion  respect ive-  
ly, there has been some cr i t i ca l  d is -  
cuss ion lately, par t i cu lar ly  on the 
grounds of exper imenta l  results.  These 
suggest  that d i f fe rent  def in i t ions  of 
operat ions  should be mainta ined  accord-  
ing to and comparable  with the scene- 
f rame-d is t inc t ion  aluded to above. For 
the generat ion  of new mean ings  which 
denote poss ib le  but  not  yet labeled 
e lements  (or sets of elements) in U, it 
can wel l  be argued that the fo l lowing 
def in i t ions  should operate on both, 
re ferent ia l  meanings  M(x) and l inguis-  
tic descr ip t ions  D(z) the former of 
which only are given here. 
Negat ion  (complement) : 
~x: = M(x) = I -~L(Z ,X)  for al l  z (8) 
Con junct io  ~ ( intersect ion):  
x ~,x':= M(x~x ' )= 
min im L(z,x) ,~(z ,x ' ) \ ]  for al l  z (9) 
Ad junct ion  (union) : 
x vx': = M(xox ' )= 
max\[~L(Z,X\]  ,~L(Z,X') \] for all z (10) 
A l though formal ly  sat is factory  - as 
out l ined and i l lust rated by PRUF - the 
approach's  basic assumpt ion concern ing 
the re ferent ia l  nature of natura l  mean-  
ing proves to be cruc ia l  for its empir -  
ical appl icab i l i ty :  in order to deter -  
mine the membersh ip -grades  of a fuzzy 
set, or fuzzy re lat ion  respect ive ly ,  
one has to have access to re levant  
empir ica l  data def ined to const i tute  
the sets, and some operat iona l  means to 
ca lculate the numer ica l  va lues  from 
these data. 
As the domain of the fuzzy re lat ion  
~ conta in not only the set of terms i L  
of a language, T, but also the set of 
objects and/or  processes these terms are 
be l ieved to denote in the universe,  U, 
both these sets should be access ib le  in 
order to let an empir ica l  procedure be 
devised that could be ass igned to ;~T." 
Al l  that Zadeh /24/ is of fer ing in That  
respect,  stays empir ica l ly  rather  vague. 
He assumes that "each of the symbols or 
names in T may be def ined ostens ive ly  
or by exempl i f i cat ion .  That is by 
point ing or otherwise focuss ing on a 
real  or abst ract  ob ject  in U and indi- 
cat ing the degree - on the scale from 
0 to I - to which it is compat ib le  with 
the symbol  in quest ion".  
This cannot  be cons idered a so lut ion 
which may be cal led both adequate and 
operat iona l  in the above sense. Taken 
to be executable ,  Zadeh's suggest ion 
necessar i ly  involves probands' quest ion-  
ing about  what  they think or be l ieve a 
term denotes.  Thus,  the procedure would  
again have to rely on the indiv idual  in- 
t rospect ion of a mul t i tude  of competent  
speakers,  instead of making these 
speakers employ the term's denotat iona l  
and/or connotat iona l  funct ion in the 
course of communicat ive  verba l  inter-  
action. However,  exper imenta l  psycho l -  
ogy has taught us to expect  cons iderate  
d i f fe rences  between what people think 
they would do under certa in  presupposed 
condit ions,  and what  in fact  they wi l l  
do when these condi t ions are real.  And 
there is every reason to assume that 
this d i f ference is found in cases of 
language per formance,  too. 
So, it would  appear more appropr ia te  
to make natura l  language use the basis 
for ident i fy ing those language regular -  
ities, which under certa in communica-  
tion frame condi t ions  real  speakers/  
hearers  fo l low and/or  establ ish in d is-  
course. These wi l l  consequent ly  a l low 
natural  language meaning (whatever that 
may be) not only to be intended and 
understood,  but a lso to be analysed and 
represented.  As this apparent ly  is the 
only cer ta inty  about meaning anyway,  
namely that it can only be const i tuted 
by means of natura l  language texts, 
these should also be able to provide 
the necessary  data wi th  the advantage 
of being empi r ica l ly  access ib le .  As-  
sembled in a pragmat ica l ly  homogeneous  
corpus, the usage regu lar i t ies  which 
the lexical  items produce,  may thus be 
79 
analysed s tat i s t i ca l ly  w i th  the numer-  
ical va lues obtained to def ine fuzzy 
vocabu lary  mappings  /16/. 
5. An  empir ica l  reconst ruct !on  
Fo l lowing  this l ine of argument  is 
to ask for a connotat iona l  supplement  
to the denotat iona l  approach Zadeh for- 
warded so far. This goes along with  a 
necessary  re - in terpretat ion  of what  the 
sets T and U (I) in the re ferent ia l  
meaning re lat ion poss ib ly  stand for. 
From a structura l  po int -o f -v iew,  T is 
not just a set of terms of a language 
any more,  but a system of lexical  units  
the usage regular i t ies  of which induce 
a re la t iona l  s t ructure of its own. So, 
this structure does not just a l low for 
a set of objects  and/or processes  in U 
to be denoted,  but it const i tu tes  them 
as a system of concept -po ints ,  which is 
dependent  on, but not ident ica l  with 
the one induced by the usage regu lar -  
it ies of terms as employed and ident i -  
f ied in natura l  language d iscourse  /17/. 
Thus, being a non-symmetr ic ,  fuzzy, 
b inary re lat ion,  ~ can empi r i ca l ly  be 
reconst ructed  only on the basis  of 
natura l  language d iscourse  data. So 
far, s tat i s t ica l  procedures  have been 
used for the reconst ruct ion  by a con- 
secut ive mapp ing  in three stages from 
T to U, prov id ing the membersh ip -grades  
f?ro~nLthe" f i rst  stage co -occur rences  of 
terms are not just counted but the in- 
tens i t ies  of co -occur r ing  terms in the 
texts of the database are ca lcu lated.  
This is done by a mod i f ied  cor re la t ion-  
coe f f i c ient  ~ that measures  mutua l  (po- 
sitive) a f f in i ty  or (negative) repug-  
nancy of pairs of terms x ,x '~T by real  
numbers from the interval  \[-I, +I \ ] .  
can therefore be cons idered a fuzzy re- 
lat ion in the Car tes ian -product  of the 
set of terms T used in the texts ana- 
lysed 
: T x T ,~, ,  I : \ [ - I ,+ I \ ]  ; 
::  {xi  , i : I  . . . . .  n T (11 
By cond i t ion ing  this fuzzy re lat ion  
on the x~T,  we get a non- fuzzy  mapp ing  
~Ix i  : T ---> I n, C := I n (12) 
This mapping ass igns to each x~T one 
and only one so-cal led corpus-po int  y 
def ined by the n- tupel  of membersh ip -  
g rades~(x i ,x )  in the corpus space C 
~(x i ,x )  := y~C (13) 
Each corpus-po int  y '~  C may thus be 
cons idered a formal  notat ion  of the 
usage regu lar i t ies ,  measured  by grades 
of intensity,  any one term x' shows 
aga inst  all the other terms x.~/ T. 
On the second s.tage the d i{ ferences  
of usage are ca lcu lated.  This is done by 
a d is tance measure ~ , wh ich  y ie lds real,  
non-negat ive,  numer i?a l  va lues from an 
i 
interval  s tandard ized to \[0,1\] to denote 
the d is tances between any two corpus -  
points y ,y '~  C. ~I can also be consi-  
dered a fuzzy,  b inary  re lat ion  in the 
set of a l l  corpus-po ints  y. def ined to 
const i tute  the corpus space l C 
~I : C x C --~ I; I := \[O,1\]; 
C :: \[yi} , i = I ..... n (I 4) 
By cond i t ion ing  this fuzzy re lat ion ~. 
on the Yi (or - fo l lowing (13) - the ~ 
x. respect ively)  we get a non- fuzzy  i mapp ing  
$11xi  : C--t in;  U := I n (15) 
This mapping ass igns to each y~C (or 
x6T  respect ively)  one and only one so- 
cal led mean ing-  or concept -po in t  z de-  
f ined by the n- tupe!  of d i s tance-va lues  
in the semant ic  space U, 
~I (Yi 'x) : ~I (Yi 'y) :: zeU (16) 
Each concept -po in t  z '~  U may thus be 
cons idered a formal  notat ion of al l  the 
d i f ferences  of al l  usage regu lar i t ies ,  
as a funct ion of which the meaning of a 
term x '~ T can be character ized.  
Therefore  it can be ident i f ied - 
accord ing to (13) - with (4) , i.e. the 
l iniguistic d@iScrliptlion , D (z') , of a 
concept -po in t  z' wh ich  is a fuzzy sub- 
set in T 
~1(xi ,z ' )  := D(z') C T (17) 
On the third stage of the conse-  
cut ive  mapping,  there wi l l  topologica l  
env i ronments  of concept -po in ts  be cal -  
cu lated - in analogy to (14) - by a 
d is tance measure ~9 which speci f ies  the 
d is tances between ~ny two z , z '~  U. Thus 
again, ~92 may a lso be interpreted as a 
fuzzy, b inary  re lat ion  in the set of 
al l  concept -po in ts  z def ined to con- 
st i tute the semant ic l space U 
~2 : U x U--~ I ; I := \[O,1\];

The condi t ion ing of ~^ on the z re- 
sults in a non- fuzzy  ~apping i

~ 02\[z i : U-->I n (19) 
which assigns to each z~U (and - fol- 
lowing (16) - x~T respectively) one 
and only one n-tupel of distances that 
- scaled according to decreasing values- 
will constitute the environment E(z) 
$2(zi,x) = $2(zi,z):= E(z) (20) 
Any such environment E(z') can be con- 
sidered a formal means to describe the 
position of a concept point z' by its 
adjacent neighbours in the semantic 
space which is constituted by functions 
of differences of language usage regu- 
larities. E(z') can therefore be iden- 
tified - following (16) and (20) - with 
(3) the conceptual meaning, M(x'), of a 
term x' which is a fuzzy subset in U 
~2(zi,x') := M(x') c U (21) 
We are now in the position to assign 
to the fuzzy relation 
: T x (22) 
and the two-sided correspondence 3) 
and (4) induced by it, the following 
operations. 
The two distance measures ~ (14) and 
~9 (18), operating an numerical" data 
obtained from the correlational analy- 
sis (11) of lexical items employed in a 
corpus of natural language texts, will 
determine the membership-grades to be 
associated with (22), namely for the 
correspondence (4) induced by tL  accord- 
ing to (15) inserting 
al)Xi:= , (xi,z i) = T (23) 
and for its inversion the correspond- 
ence (3) according to (19) inserting 
%Izi  (24) 
This concludes the empirical recon- 
struction, leaving open only the coeff i-  
cients alluded to above. 
Given the lemmatized vocabulary V as 
a proper subset of T of lexical units 
V :={xi~ ; i=1,...,n 
employed in a corpus K of natural lan- 
guage texts as specified above 
K :=~t}  ; t=1,...,m 
where 
m 
~- st:= S S = st; I t 
t=1 
(25) 
is the sum S of all text-lengths s t 
measured by the number of lexical 
units (tokens) in the corpus, and 
m 
H = ~ ht! I t ~ h t ~ H 
t=1 
(26) 
is the total frequency H of a lexical 
unit x (type) computed over all texts 
in the corpus, then the modif ied corre- 
lation-coeff icient ~x to be inserted 
into (11) reads

The distances have been calculated

West -German language compar ison.  
So far, two samples from corpora 
cons is t ing of texts from the East -Ger -  
man newspaper  'Neues Deutschland'  and 
the West -German newspaper  'Die Welt' 
have been analysed accord ing to the 
procedures  out l ined.  A l though the sam- 
ples analysed are rather  small  - approx-  
imately  3000 running words (tokens) of 
roughly  300 lemmat ized words (types) - 
the results  look qui te  promis ing to the 
nat ive speaker  of German. In mapping the 
connotat iona l  d i f fe rence  which some 
morpho log ica l ly  ident ica l  German lexi-  
cal entr ies have deve loped a lmost  si-  
mu l taneous ly  af ter  twenty years of us- 
age in a der ided country 's  rather  
st r ict ly  separated populat ion,  the 
p i lo t -s tudy 's  results  seem to indicate 
that - l ingu is t i ca l ly  - an addi t iona l  
analys is  of comparab le  text -corpora of 
ear l ier  and/or  later years could pro- 
v ide the d iachron ic  complement  to the 
so far synchr0nic  invest igat ion  into 
the lexical  s t ructures concerned,  al-  
lowing for the empir ica l  reconst ruct ion  
not only of their  instantaneous word-  
meanings,  but of their t ime-dependent  
procdura l  changes that Nowakowska  /13/ 
aims at. Being induced by vary ing lan- 
guage usages,  these can operat iona l ly  
be ana lysed as regular i t ies  fo l lowed 
and/or  estab l i shed by language users to 
d i f fer ing degrees,  wh ich  hence may 
formal ly  be represented as funct ions 
that const i tute  dynamic systems to mod-  
el semiot ic  structures.  
In the above Tables I and 2 the 
l inguist ic  depcr ip t ion  D(z) of a con-  
cept  point  z is g iven as wel l  as the 
conceptua l  meg ning M(x) of a vocabu lary
