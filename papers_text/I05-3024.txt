Abstract
This paper presents a data-driven language 
independent word segmentation system that 
has been trained for Chinese corpus at the 
second Chinese word segmentation bakeoff. 
The system consists of a base segmentation 
algorithm and the refining procedures for 
the undecided character sequences. It does 
not use any lexicon and the base 
segmentation is simply done by character 
bigram and HMM-model is applied for the 
remaining character sequences. As a final 
step, high-frequency character trigram 
modifies the error-prone parts of the text.T1T
1 Introduction
We participated in the closed track of the second 
Chinese word segmentation bakeoff for the 
training corpus of HK (City University of Hong 
Kong, PK (Beijing University), and MS 
(Microsoft Research). Our system is independent 
of the corpus or the language that we also 
registered for AS (Academia Sinica) track, but 
failed to generate a result because of the code set 
problem. AS uses two-byte space characters 
instead of a blank(0x20), and more 0x0A is used 
in AS that is regarded as EOF in Windows 
environment.  
The result of our system is not a top-level 
system when compared to other systems. 
However, our approach is quite acceptable 
because the data-driven methods can contribute 
to improving the accuracy of other word 
segmentation systems because we did not 
performed a tuning the system to fix the 
frequently repeating error patterns.

2 Bigram and trigram data 
We extracted a character bigram data from the 
training corpus. In the previous studies, 
Shim(1996) and Kang(2001) constructed space 
generation probability for each adjacent two 
characters XY. They are inside probability 
?X_Y?, left-side probability ?_XY?, and 
right-side probability ?XY_?.T 2 T That is, they 
ignored ?space information?. In our bigram data, 
inside and outside space information is extracted 
from the training corpus, together with the 
character pairs. We call it ?extended bigram data? 
and it has eight types of frequency data. For 
example, XY consists of the frequencies of 
?0X0Y0?, ?0X0Y1?, ?0X1Y0?, ?0X1Y1?, 
?1X0Y0?, ?1X0Y1?, ?1X1Y0?, and ?1X1Y1?.T3T
From the frequencies of the extended bigram data, 
we compute the space generation probability of 
Pt=000(CiCi+1) and left/right/inside probabilities 
are also computed from the extended bigram 
data.
Pt=000(CiCi+1) = Ft=000(CiCi+1) / ?

Extended bigram data is more sophisticated than 
the basic bigram data that the accuracy is better 
than that of the basic bigram data. 
3 Segmentation algorithm 
3.1 Base Algorithm 
The base segmentation algorithm is a HMM 
model together with the space-insertion 
probability. HMM model chooses the

segmentation with the higheset probability. 
Given a sentence of n characters, S = c1c2...cn, has 
a segmentation of m words, then segmentation 
probability is estimated as P(T,S) = P(t1,n, c1,n)
??   nii iiiii ttcctp0 121 ),|( . Our starting point 
of the word segmentation was the high precision 
ratio for the Korean language. We first tried to 
simply applying the extended bigram data with 
an appropriate threshold. However, it is supposed 
that there is a limitation of this approach because 
of the low recall ratio. It caused an adoption of 
HMM model together with the extended bigram 
data. Table 1 shows the results of HMM with 
extended bigram data.

3.2 Postprocessing by trigram data 
Extended bigram data in Section 2 consists of 2 
adjacent characters and 3 space information 
(2C3S). In contrast, we may extract trigram data 
that is constructed by 3 characters and 2 space 
information(3C2S). This 3C2S trigram data has a 
form of ?X0Y0Z?, ?X0Y1Z?, ?X1Y0Z?, and 
?X1Y1Z?. That is 3 character sequence XYZ has 
4 frequency data. We supposed that ?there are 
frequent 3-character sequences that are biased to 
one of the spacing pattern?.  
We verified this supposition by improving the 
accuracy of the word segmentation result. Table 
2 shows the final result of the postprocessing. 
Postprocessing by trigram data got an increase of 
both recall and precision. When compared to the 
base segmentation results of Table 1, F-measures 
are increased by 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.8%, 
respectively. 
As an improvement of the system performance, 
character trigram data has been extracted from 
the training corpus.

4 Pure data-driven method without 
using HMM 
Only after submitting the results for bakeoff 2005, 
we noticed that the accuracy of HMM model is 
low. It is not clear what the problem is and there 
is a possibility of the implementation error. So, 
we looked for a pure data-driven method without 
using HMM model. The first step in the base 
segmentation is to apply extended bigram with 
no space information. In this step, only the spaces 
with high confidence are fixed and others are 
marked as ?undecided?.T 5 T  In the second step, 
extended bigram with space information is 
applied. Two more postprocessing modules are 
added for refinements. One of them is to adopt 
the word-length feature by using the fact that 
average length of Chinese word is 1.6 characters. 
The other is to construct ?error dictionary? for the 
training data. Error dictionary is constructed by 
running training data and comparing the 
differences. The context information of error 
dictionary is four characters (left two and right 
two characters). The new approach got a better 
result than that of the final result of bakeoff 2005 
as shown in Table 3.

bakeoff 2005 results. F-measures of bakeoff 2005 
results are 0.921, 0.912, and 0.947, respectively. The 
reason was not identified. Table 1 and Table 2 are 
computed by the evaluation program ?score.txt? in the 
website of SIGHAN bakeoff 2005.

5 Conclusion
We presented our word segmentation method for 
the closed track of bakeoff 2005. Our approach is 
data-driven and language independent. That is, 
our method is purely statistical method that no 
language dependent features are applied for 
tuning or improving the accuracy. Word 
segmentation system for bakeoff 2005 applied 
HMM model together with extended bigram and 
trigram data. The results show that word 
segmentation problem can be solved with no 
lexicons or language-dependent resources.
One of the good point of our approach is that 
data-driven language independent approach is 
quite acceptable for the word segmentation 
problem. We also expect that our data-driven 
method would be a good solution for the 
enhancement of word segmentation systems as a 
postprocessing module.
