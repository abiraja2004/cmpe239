A major problem conrronting computer  pro:lram:. dr iven 
by nnturol-1 ngu ge input  consists of thc interprctntion of 
1inguh. l  ic cxprossiobs f o r  which the int endcd literal 
meaning is  not e:q~l ic i t ly  given by the l c ~ i o i ~ l  coml>onents 
of the expresL;ion. ~'tn ccxi~mple is thc "extended useu of the 
verb ' l e a p t  in 'the country l e a p t  to prosperity'. buch 
extended usages--whether cuns i -as  inilntcd or original-- 
czn be considered metaphorical t o  the cktcnt t h - , t  they are 
based on analogies. This  paper establishes a framework f o r  
interpretin? netaphoric,ll expres ionk by analysis o f  under-

6. Conclusion 
Metaphorical usages have often been regarded n s  "special 
ccscou to vhich the particular language analysis mcthod under 
discussitm did not apply. This pnpcr prcsdnts n mcthod for 
comsutez* undcistnnding of a class of phrases in which the 
verb i s  used 9netnphoricol lytt ,  but which ignorer: the dis- 
tinction between rrextcndedlv and "assi~ni l  t e d t r  usages. This 
approach provides flexibility i n  handling previously unseen 
usages, The assumjtion underlying t h i s  approach is that  
analogies ore involved in  language understanding t o  a greater 
extent than speakers consciously realize. 
1.1. - Analogies 
Analogies arc the  means by which we substitute, extend 
or borrow concepts. In the use of an analogy, a word is 
borro?+erl Jrom its usual context  t o  exprcs3 some component of 
meaning sh'rrcd by the concept underlying the borrowed word 
in its l i teral sense and the concept which the borrowed word 
i s  t o  reprclsent. T h i s  results i n  an extendeu o r  netaphorical 
use or the word. The system t o  be described i s  intended to 
show the analogy comprehension necessary for the interpreta- 
tion of metaphorical usages of verbs. 
The problem of determining the meanins of a metaphorical 
expression is one of knowing the c r i t i c a l  similarities and 
differences which a borrowed sense of a word has w i t h  respect 
to the ori lginol  sensc. In somc case.; an es::cntic,lly meto- 
?horic,lL usage ccoses to be t l~ough t  of as borror~cd,  nnd

Here the f i r s t  example oprlears to be ncraphorical, the second 
not. A langu,~ge nnaLy..er prepared to handle only non-meta- 
pl10ri.c~ 1 input might achieve the c o r r e c t  interpret2 t ion  o f  
'1 see1 i n  the sensc of '1 un~crst'nd I .  :io,:evcr, it would 
succcecl only if lsectswere listed' in the dictionall) as enuiv- 
alent  to tunaerut..i~d' in one sensc. Such n so lu t ion  ignores  
the cc:~pahilities which humrns hhve for correctly interpreting 
such sentences w i t h o u t  h ving lecrned t h i s  s:.nonymity. A 
parser which lacks t h i s  a b i l i t y ,  i.e. to i n t e r p r e t  without 
re lying on ad hoc aids, w i l l  n..t have the f lex ib i l ' i ty  required 
to a,-proach similrr problems in r ~ h i c h  such nids are missing 
due t o  the prejudices of the aerson who deir'ines verbs for 
the l e s i c o n .  
In this sense, we should be able r o  unucrst-nd mcta- 
phorical sentences on the basis of an analogy to the ordinary 
or l i t e r a l  sensc of thc words involved. The excl~-nlea 
1) The idea of growing their own radishes was born , 
2) He hid his embarrassment about the honey pot 
3) He relinquished his hopes 
4) Her painting s a i d  something t o  m e  
are a l l  metaphorical in  d i f f e r e n t  ways w i t h  respect to the 
ordinary sense of the verb: the l i t e r a l  effect of 'hidn' is 
visual;  thnt of 'relinquisht has to do with control  of a 
phyeical concept; thnt of say1 has to do with Linguistically 
expressed information. But in each case there is an analogy 
between the ordinary .mnti the metaphorical usage of the verb. 
The analop*.-d~onsists of the similarity of the which 
occur in the mn-metaphorical and metaphorical usages: 
I.), The idea (= to grow t h e i r  own radishes) was born 
The baby (= Percy) was born 
Effect = n e w  idea (baby) can be related to 
2 )  He hid his  embarrassi~~ent about the honey pot 
Xe hid the honey pot  
E f f e c t  = Others are  not visually aw-ire of his emborrass- 
ment (honey p o t )  
3) H e  rel inquished his hopes 
He relinquished the presidency 
Effect = IIe no longer has a certain ot tk ibute  
4) H e r  painting m i d  something t o  m e  
Her book araid somet1 ng to me 
She sa id  something to me 
Effect = I have a ~ n e w  mental concept to consider 
Information derived f rom such metaphorical expressions 
should at l e a s t  include analogous effects of t h i s  kind, 
dhich represlmt the "rcsultlt component of: tho meaning of the 
expression. (A related problem of extracting conceptual 
inferences is d&scussed by Schank and Xieger (8 ). ) 
This  task  requires a verb description system which 
cittcgorines verbs* by t w o  c r i t e r i a  : 
1) t h e  i den t i t i c . i t i on  of lm. underlying d t ruc tu ra l  
component which is s imi lar  f o r  verbs which arc used 
analogously in linguistic expressi. ns , and 
2) the identification of a certain level at which the 
verb a p p l i e s ,  such as "physicallt . 
Each verb w i l l  thus be classified, not i n  t e r m s  of a single 
category, but in terms of two type9 of variables having 
values according to these two criteria. Thus levels and 
structure-concepts must be determined which can be used as 
a basic form of description of verbs in the dictionary. 
1.2. Conceptual dependency interpretations 
In addition to such verb descriptions, which serve the 
analysis task, the form of "targetu representations, i . e .  of 
the l i t era l  interpretations must be considered. The basic  
a s s t q t i o n  underlying a choice of representation is that a 
"translation" from a metaphorical to a corresponding literal 
ex:~ression cannot be achieved by manipulaf ion of components 
at any syntactic level. What is needed is an tvinterlinguatt,  
which deals with relationships between concepts a t  the 
cognitive l eve l .  The conceptual represent at ions which apply 
t o  th ie  interlingua are not dependent on the o r ig ina l  lexical 
form (or language) of the input, and can be used to generate 
paraphrases of the input i n to  the same or other languages, 
given the concept-to-syntax mapping rules f o r  that ~ongu$ge. 
The chdea of a form of conceptual representation must be 
guided by the extent to ~ h i c h  it shows re l , l t ionships  brtween 
concepts at the cognitive level. The conceptual dependency 
theory of Schank (6-9) provides such a- representation in 
terms of predicntive and qual i fy ing dependencies between 
conceptual categories and is assumed as the context of the 
method presented here. 
In a dependency, according t o  this theory, a concept 
o f  one conceptual category is dependent on, qual i f i e s  directly 
or serves to describe a concept of another conceptual category 
according to rules of conceivability. These unambiguous, 
language-free dependencies are word-independent, although the 
concept symbols on occasion map directly in to  some lexical  
term expressing these concepts. The nature o f  conceptual 
dependency representations, as well as their s u i t a b i l i t y  f o r  
metaphor analyses, can be conveyed by a simple example. 'The 
ink stained the f loor'  can be represented conceptually as 
. . ink 
color: X j  . The significance of thls 
colors x i  
representation lies not i n  the particular hotation adopted, 
but in the components of meaning which it r c v e ~ l s .  The 
dots (... ...) indicate tht1t the ink is not necessnrily the 
agent, but is merely somehow involved in thc action. The 
~ ~ d k @ t b n  arrow!' ( m) indicates n causal reLn tionship as 
opposed to thc eesclmple 'the ink h i t  the floorv. 'The 
notation indicntcs n change of s t a t e  of tfloorl, ar mare 
s p e c i f i c n l l y ,  an Inalienable P U T  of the floor. The 'NEJ~ative' 
notation is a iconnotationtt ( 5 )  wl~ich is secondary to the 
purely objective representdtion of 'stainT. 
If it is assumed that the use of metaphor relies on some 
similarity of semantic components between an ordinary and an 
extended sense, it c.ln be seen that a representation of this 
type, ref Lecting a conceptually-oriented sen-ntic theory,  is 
ndequcte to the task at hand. By reference to the abstract 
components of causation, change of state,  pert vs. %,hole and 
negativeness r e v e ~ l e d  by the iibove c u n c e p t u ~ l  structure for 
*staint, a paraphrase for the metaphorical 'his  business 
activities stained his reputationT is essily npproximated; 
'his activities csused a neg~.tive change in (part of) his 
reputation1. There is no dependence on complex trznsforrna- 
tions or mukt ip l e  word senses, which might in fact fail in 
the: case of novel f oms of expression, such as more rtcreative" 
metaphor. 
The components of conceptual dependency representation 
can be briefly described as follows. The conceptual categories 
between which the various conceptdal dependencies exist are 
ACT, PP ( l fpicture produceru) and PA ("picture assistcr~), 
At tho eyntaoti~ level ,  these categories are sometimes e m  
premed in the English language by verbs ,  nouns and adjec- 
tives respectively. However, such correspondence does not  
always occur. For example, many nouns can be expressed 
directly in terms of verbal o r  attributive concepts ('the 
' tha t  which,..'). Such nouns would not b e  s t a t c  of... , 
mapped directly i n to  PPs. 
The dependencies which hold between the  specif ied 
categories o t  the cognit ive  level must ult imittely b e  given* 
by a uconceptual grammarM which reflects their conceivability 
and theref ore their comprehensibility. Such n grammar, 
independent 6f actual word-construct usage, would include 
information such as what kind of concepts can be related by 
a specification of p o s i t i o n  in time. Our concern here, 
however, w i l l  be mainly with the lower-level  and more detailed 
information contained i n  a bfconceptuolizationl', or s i m p l e  
conoeptual s tructure. 
The general conceptual dependency format which has been 
established for the conceptualizations which w i l l  be referred 
to takes one of the fo l lowing  forms (semantic terms which 
are irrelevsnt to t he  metaphor problem, such as tense, 
will be ignored): 
<relation> 
PP (object)  PP (object)  
ON 
e,g. ink f l o o r  
The ink is on the f l o o r  
The ink is in contact with the floor 
PP (objec t )  < PA (attribute) 
e-g. ink <+> COWR:  black 
The ink is black 
The ink has a black c o l o r  
(attribute-value (new)> 
(change of s t a t e )  
(attribute-value (old)) 
CCLOR: black 
e.g. ink 
COLOR: ? 
The ink turned black 
The ink changed to a black color 
(goal> 
PP (actor) < $  r-lm (action) +PP (object +- C <source, 
I 
(continued) +<instrumental conceptualization> 
Eiary 
e.g. John<=> ATRANS +- C0NTROL:ink

John gave Siary the ink by handing it to her 
John handed Mary the ink 
CP(mrg 1 
or JohneEPPRwS +$ 
? "-C CP (John) 
John communicated the ink s t o r y  to Mary 
Mary heard about the ink from John 
The actual relevancc and character of  some of t h e  
components of the latter type depends on which ACT is present.

operational metaphor routine. 
2.1, Levels 
The four levels postulated for vcrbnl concepts are: 
PIIYSJCAL (e.g. 'touch1) 
mNT& (em& 'think' ) 
SENSOR' (e.g. 'seet) 
CONTROL (e.g. 'donate') 
The PHYSICAL Level includes verbs which predicate the 
existence, attributes or associations of objects w i t h  
spat ia l  (material) aspects, 
The PENTAL - l e v e l  is distincf in that on t h i s  
level ere representations of objects, or of other represen- 
tations in a recursive manner. It is thus the l e v e l  through 
whlh thought and communication take place. Verbs of thought 
have been analyzed in (8). Since l;Ch'T& objects are not 
real-world objects  or situations, but rather pointers to 
such objects, they cannot be concqtually dependent on 
non-3ENTAL concepts other than (usually human) mental 
processors. 
The SENSORY level includes V W s  of perception, or the 
reception of %utgesl1. Concepts on this l eve l  prnvi.de the 
l i n k  f r ~ m  the physical world t o  the consciousness of a 
language user as well as to o t h e r  animate beings.  SEXMRY 
concepts could be analyzed in PHYSICAL (spatial and temporal) 
terms. However, th i s  kind of dctail seems to have little 
relevance to the linguistic groblbms under considerhtion.  
The CCNTRLL level refers t o  relationships which express 
possession or cor l t ro l  by an animate being. An object on 
t h i s  l e v e l  is a form of control, or a "potential for actionfr. 
CONiiiOL mRBs basically consist of conditions attached to the 
actions of an animate being and are sometimes ewressed 
lexically through modal auxiliaries, for example as 'can', 
'may * or 'must *. Possession defined as a CONTlWL relat ion-  
s h i p  is thus distinguished from purely PIIYSILiL or locative 
ralntionships. The verb 'have ( a  physical  ob jec t ) ' ,  for 
example, is defined in terms of the  CON?R\L Level r a t h e r  
t b n  the PHYsICAL level. 
Each of these levels has a few sublevels (e.g. SENSORY: 
eye, ear) which are sometimes spec i f i ca l ly  referenced in 
metaphorical extensions. These are described in (5). 
2.2. Sta tes  
Given the matrix format of the verb descriptors, the 
specified levels (row components ) can best be clsrified 
by conoiderntion of the Its i m p l e s t w  structure (column component) 
as it  applies  on each level. This structure is referred to 
as a STATE o r  as  a ST.iTIC structure,  and represents i n  general 
terms "existence, with or without an n t t r i b u t e ,  and with or  
without association with another objectft .  ST.iTBs are  pre- 
sented here in two forms which represent the ' + I  and * - *  
values o f  one of the "featurestr (Section 2.4) which further 
dif  fercntiate VERBS, These two feL~-!. urc v lues  are termed 
uactual?t and "p~tential", according to whether the given 
STATE has the feature value '-HY~othet ical or '+Hypothetical '. 
STkbEs i n  these two forms represent primitive concepts t o  
which fur ther  feL!tures can be applied to obtnin  more complex 
VERBS. &n explanation of  verb entries which are ex~mples 
for the two forms a t  various l eve l s  should give some idea 
of  the scope and basis of the verb on.4ysi.s. Space consid- 
eratiuns l i m i t  the discussion to two levels.  
If other feature values arc  ignored for the moment, 
- / + ~ ~ ~ o t h e t i c a l  STATES can b e  thought of a s  the first two 
co lums  of the matrix. A t  the EENTAL l e v e l  w e  have: 
A C T W  POTENTIAL 
Percept ion 
0-Preuiczt ion: 
R think SUN:  believe 
OBJ: know 
VAL TV=+: be true 
cont, ACTUAL POTENTIAL 
R en joy SUBJ: l i k e  
OBJ: appreciate 
0 be in CP please  
VAL AV= t : AV=+ : bc nice 
"be funtr 
Voli t ion 
R 
0 
VAL DV=+: be good (to do) 
The BLRTM, level is divided i n to  two sublevels to correspond 
with the faculties of perception and vulitioc. Perceptian 
i n  turn has two forms--the predicction -_ _ _ __- of the existence of 
the - Object, and the valued perception of a p r e s u ~ o s e d  Object. 
Only the former t y p e  i s  examined here. 
It is first noted that this and each sublevcl allows 
for an R-, 0- and VU-form or' a VLB. 0 = Object, R = 
Recipient or experiencer ( "loc~tion" , "sollrcelt or "goal t t  
of O ) ,  dnd VAL = VALW of 0. The labels R,  0 and VXL indicate 
whether the lexical entry which n ~ p s  into the slcts headed 
by these lzbels expresses a verbal concept from the p c i n t  o f  
view of R or 0, o r  expresses a value 02  0. Syntactically, 
the "point of view" of R o r  0 i s  r e f l e c t e d  by a verb having 
a noun ~ i t h ' ~ ' r o l e "  R or 0 respectively as syntactic subject .  
For cxLlrnt?le, the R-role ' see  corresponds t b  the 0-role 
'appear1. If no verb for o given slot comes to mind, a 
phrase is given which s imply ref lscts the  conceptUcl represen- 
tation of t h i s  STrdE. Thus the  O-role entry corrcspondlng 
t o  tbe l i evc l  i s  tO<=propbsition) be in  - Long I Term - f.kmoryl. 
The vnlue iml-,osed by 'be l i eve t  on the Object, which f o r  this 
sublevcl  is a Truth Vnlue (TV), i s  pos i t i ve  ( *+ ). 
Verbs or predicate adjectives ip the ' V d W  row express 
a possible value of the Object as onposed to thc relr t ionship 
of the Object to on R which is givcn by 0-role vcrbs. 
Uthough the verbs and adject ives  given as examples ~ 1 1  presume 
a p o s i t i v e  vnlue o f  0, other degrees of positiveness on the 
vaLue scale could underlie othrr vcrbs or ad j c c t  i v e s .  For 
instance,  'be indifferent to' means that the bject lies midway 
between the '+' arlu - .I) Attitude or - Aesthetic v d u e  for the 
expcriencer. 
aince a IENTrlL aT.bE expresses an attitude townrds a 
IvENTAL object which may or may not correspond with that o f  
'loutsiue observersf1,  verbs may express ci ther  a SJBJect ive  
or an 'OBJective* MENTAL STATE, as  shown. T h ~ t  i s ,  a speaker 
says 'he knows that . .  . ' to mean 'he believes  that..  . , and it 
is true '. 
The difference between the ACTUAL and POTLNTIAL columns 
can best be explained in terms of the present examnle. 
Generally, *actual1 refers to the fact thct the relationship 
underlying the verb i s  presently "in operationM, l f r e a l i ~ e d v  
or wexpressedtt. 'Potentialt denotes that tllc object can be 
r e t r i e v e d  i n  order to create [In 'actual' relati L nship. Thus

diLierence is expressed through representation o f  1; as CP 
(Conscious 1hcessor) and UIEi f o r  ' t h ink  an3 'believe

of 'thinkv, slnce o truth value is not assigned t o  a I.LE;T.~L

The S L ~ ? - ~ O R Y  l e v e l  can be i l l u s t r a t e d  b f i c f l y  by reference 
t o  the re l , rcscn ta t ion  of conccptual attributes in terr~.s of

2.3, Structures 
Structures reflect abstract ions of verbal concepts, i , ~

recognire independently of whether any matter  or object 
involved is visible, A V E d  structure cons i s t s  of an

ST:LT EVAL ( 0  ld ) 
STATES, which underlie verbs sbch as 'think1, 'watcht,  t c ~ n t r o l t ,  
'havet and 'be', have been introduced above. In t h e  verb 
definitiuns t o  follow, STATES a r e  represented mnemonically 
as '(0 AT R ) '  and '(0 BE)? or '(0 BE (VAL): ) I .  
The transition-arrow should reflect the  assumption 
that language-users usdlly focus on a certain aspect of the 
chdnge uuality, e.g. ' s t a r t  s t h t e t  o r  ' s top  s t a t e 1 ,  even 
though s t o p p i ~ g  one state alw.iys me-ins s t a r t i n g  another. 
Thus there are three t y p e s  of change-of-state effects: 
a )  TUNs.tTION (complete) mu 1: I--* 
b) start TRiNSITION ( leave STA'IE) (TR-L) '  
I-- C )  f in i sh  TILINSITIUN (enter STATE) (TR-E) , 
I-, .$ 
These structures underlie verbs such as a) 'give1, 'pass t o ' ;  
Features might be thought of either 1) as - each 
providing an addit ional  dimension of thc matrix in terms of 
its set of vnlues or 2 )  as applying t o  structures in various 
combinations of vnlues to f o m  configurations of feature 
values. In the l a t t e r  case, the ~~nfigurntions provide the 
values (columns ) of one (horizontal ) dimension. In either 
case, the vnlues of the following binary features indicate 
whether a certain conceptual element is present in n VERB. 
The above structures implicitly presume n negntive value for 
all Eeatures except CONTINUOUS, which is positive (c.f. 
Fillmoret s l-bbmentary (1)). Explicitly stat& feature 
values expand the i d o r m d t i o n  given by these structures in

3.2, Function descriptor8 
In addition to c ~ n c c p t u a l  features which aetern~ine the 
thcre are specific non-conceptual function associ ; \ t ions which 
apply to m a y  NObiI&sIs ,  e s p e c i a ~ l y  + b L i i ~ b E  ones, which serve 
a s  dcrining elements. Also ''sizeM cr i ter ia  f o r  dependencies 
arc recognided in the form of a 0-5 scale vL.lue for physical 
objects. Although these descriptors ore more i lnnor tont  for 
problems not dealt w i t h  here ( s e e  ( 5 )  ) , they also enter the 
question of metcphorical interpretations. iior example, the 
knowledge thL:t the functions of both a ship o t r a c t o r  in- 
cluue the notion of 'goingt or 'movingt is of use in recog- 
nizing the substitution of i p '  i o r  ' t r a c t o r t  i n  'the s h i p  
plowed the seat vs. the L i t e r n l  'tile t r a c t o r  plowed the f i e l d ' .  
The function can then be incorporated into 2n approximation of 
the mekning of the former exarn~le. 
aeveral t y p e s  of function have been identified, according 
to the conceptual roles which the object plays in the action 
which represents the realization of t h i s  functi on. The 
type which is probably referred to most extensively in meta- 
phorical intetpretations is l-GXTMN L1, meaning that the 
functional object appears as an qxternal (to the actor) 
object in the conceptual representation of an act ion  which 
serves as an instrument t o  some rasu l t .  I n  this  experimental 
inq~lcmcntnt ion an clbbrcviated functidn r c ~ r a s c n t n t f o n  is

lansuage i s  constantly changing with r lapec t  xo what i s -  
considered "originr.1" vs . \ghat is an established word 
sense o r  idiom. T h i s  phen.menon c ~ u l d  prove  to be a 
quandary f o r  anyone defining verbs or other l ex icc l  items 
f o r  e n t r y  i n t o  the dictionary. 'rhc L - u a s t i o n  af 16a: s ~ n s e  
of il verb is l i t e r a l  m d  wt1.d is  m e t a p h ~ r i c ~ ~ l  can be cmectec 
to vary not only from one i n d i v i d u a l  to another, but also 
over time, 
In order to alleviate this problem, it is suggested 
that a d e f i n i t i o n  0 2  a metaphorical us~:ge include any verb 
which i s  "borrowed" f rom arrot\er level, whether o r  not 
speakers are still consc ious  o f  this borrowing. For 
instance, the word 'destroy' is easily conceived of as 
applying t c  all levels ('destroy house, image, idea, 
pr iv i l ege  ) . IIoweVer, t Flis s y s t e m  ass i p s  i t  t o  the 
PHYSIWL l e v e l ,  f r o m  which it can be borrowed by extension 
to other levels. A verb is simply always deLined as applying 
ltnoru&llylt only to a certain base Level (which in case o f  
dbubt con be considered to be the PHYSICAL level ,  if t ha t  
l e v e l  is one of the alternatives 1. A human ed i to r  wed not 
worry about whether usages of the verb at other levels Bra 
metaphorical. 
Thus the proposed procedures rest on the. essmption 
that the ltmetaphorical senseM of a verb i s  not in the 
lexicon as such1 the semantic component should exhibit the 
analogy comprehension of humans, who do not need to hove 
such senses explained to them. If we accept that analogies 
refhr to the sharing of a conceptual component, and are 
therefore reflected in our t l levelsv,  which share one or more 
columns of our matrix, then the most significant way in 
which the verb description system can be a p p l i e d  is evident: 
glven e verb which is defined in t h e  rn'itris by ~ ? n  ent ry  ig a 
given column (structure) and row [ l e v e l ) ,  a metaphorical 
sense of t h i s  verb is represented by a V m  w i t h  the same 
strwture but a different l e v e l .  This type of extension 
can be referred to as "level  sh i f tu .  A second type of 
extensioqwhich abstracts the effects of animate a c t i ~ n s  
and app l i e s  them to inanimate objects is aescribed in 
Section 5.4,

and an R, though both t y p e s  of levels rn,-y coexist in a P; which 
maps into one of these role-concepts  (e .g.  'book1 ). In o t h e r  
words, i n  m y  metaphorical usage, a s  i n  a l i t e r a l  one, some

its literal sense. 
The noun which mat.$ into the ob jec t  02 a c o n c e p t u a l i -

4.2. Operotiunal context 
%he parser wi th  vrhlch the  n ~ c t n p h o r  interpretation 
procedure is intendcd to f unction (Riesbcck (4) ) operates 
on tl-e basis of scmantic expectations. To a large extent, 
the.;c expectations are concerncu w i t h  f inding  in the sentence 
being pdrsed an object which c o n f ~ m s  to bas ic  sem: nric  
re uirements ~ovcrning t ' -e  depenuenc of that object on a 
verb which has appeared in the sentence. If there is more 
than one poss ib le  scnse o f  t .e verb ~ ~ h i c h  has b een found, 
the choice of sense depends on what kind of cn object  is 
founc. This object  is described by a few fer-tur:.s such as 
PHTISZCAL and ANILTE. As the  perser presently is uphysically 
orientedM, expecting physical objects for verbj which 
ordinarily are interpreted in a physical sense, it is not 
able t o  f ind nn interpret idt ion for e::tondcd us.il;cs in which 
the only candidate f o r  on object is non-PHYaICAL. 
l ~ o r e  smcif i c n l l y ,  a p p o s e  t h a t  the parser finds the 
verb 'dropt i.2 the  course of a sentence analysis; t h a t  only 
one sensc QL the verb is given in the diction: r y n p n r t  from 
idiomatic usngcs such as 'drop someone o line' ; and t h a t  the 
rniniwl requirements f o r  its ob jec t  incluLLc thc. specification 
'I?HYSIG.LL~. If this restriction is not satisfied, the  porser 
must turn t o  the metaphor routine f o r  an interpretation. 
Thus if 'ideai vere t h e  only candidate f o r  an object of 
'drop',  the parser w ould note t h c  t c PHYSICAL-level specif i- 
cation (which could be represented as a +I)IIYhICAL feature- 
value) is missing from the definition of *idcat. It would

two component configurations just given.

ignore cer tz in  syntactic details such a s  word suffixes and 
tenses, in o r d e r  to a l low for some measure d judgment as to

operated on by a dialogue program or by a paraphrase program

5.1. Level shift 
Not 211 extensions a r e  made from the PHYSIC& t o  the 
non-PHYSIC;& levels. The KNTAL, s ,NSOl.Y and CQXrRCIL levels 
sometimes serve n j  a base irom which metaphorical extensions 
can be made. The examples which rollow indicnte certain 
extensions (eotnc of which have evolved into idioms) which 
can b e  made between levels.  Some types of extension are 
obviously more frequent or interesting than others. 
Examples for spec i f i ed  extensions are: 
PHYSICAL - $EN?!&: He closed h l s  mind, 
Protests rained upon the govemmcnt, 
Euro!~o and America are dri~ting apart. 
Kohoutek's tail points to i t s  origin.

PHYSICAL - SENSORY: Music floodcd the room. 
PHYdfCA - CONTROL: The p r i v i l e g e  of cleaning t h e  erdsers

Let us x-ray th i s  political party. 
SEIQSORY - CONTROL: Their rights disappeared one by one. 
CONl'ROL - PENT&: She offered him an idea. 
CONTROL - SENSORY: H e r  hat usurped his  view. 
'He closed his  mind! appears i n  the output o f  Figure 1. 
The base--i.e. PEIYsICAL--definition of fcloset is one of the 
more complicated verb definitions, s ince the syntactic object 
is either a space - e an object containing the space (which is 
f i l l e d  or eliminated),  and its complete representation w i l l  
not be discussed here. However, the "effectw portion of 
the semantic representation ior tim scnsc i n  w h i c h  the ~b ject  
is a space is th-t nothing can pass i n t o  or cut of the object 
containing the space. The rclev.~nt: portion o z  the "pass i n t o H  
internretiition is renresented by the  nested ueLinitLn: 
(close ( (PHYs) (TR-L) (STdL; ((iIYP +) Tk-E (S'I'JL'TE (0 IN R)))) 
{ROLE R) (riGdNT %) . 
(R (NR\T ( 0  + )  (BKD C (CONY + I ) )  )). 
It is noted t h a t  t he  *HY2 Value refers to the i~otentiol charnc- 
ter of the outemnost ST.iTE; the HYP vl\lue fen. the innermost 
STATE is negative, honsistont w i t h  the obscrv~ition in Section 2.2 
th'. t all pt~ysicij l  relationships (excluding separdtion) can be 
considered ltactuallr. 
The r o l e  routine determines th\ t, since *close1 is R-role, 
the uirect  object of 'close , i.e. ' h i s  mind l , maps into  R, But 
t h e  base-interpret<!t ion r o u t i n e  then discovers that i is +MENTAL 
and not  +WIalC .L as requireu by 'close'.  The vroSr;im therefore 
attempts an interpretation ct the l A d X ~ '  L lcvcl, she l e v e l  of 
'mindt. R = 'mindt is an ANIId1'L P (*he CI:.d'I': nind = 
+ )  in fulfillment oE c r i t e r i o n  - 1  It can therefore 
serve as a tl location''  a t  the 2, :NTIIL l e v e l .  0 is unspecified 
in the sentence and thus does not impose any l e v e l -  or other 
restrictions. In checking t o  see til-t the 'Eroau'  s l , e c i f i c a -  
tions by * c ~ o s e '  a r e  satisfied by *mindt, t h e  p r o g r m  finds 
that 'mind does h;rve the +CGSI'-;IN fedture 2 s  require~l. 
'fie verb can therefore be interxeted st t h e  XENTAL l e v e l .  
The innermost structure--TR-E (STA." ( 0  .Z R ) ) - - i s  extracted

consists of the dimensions r 'EUNTiiL ( l cvc l )  P, (sublevel)  
R (kol*) SGZI'E (structure) -1HP (feotura] + (vLLlue) '. For pur- 
poses ~f pi~r .~nhmsing  direct ly  out of the matrix,  the entry re- 
sultins from this s o,.rch is the hnglish verb v think1,  which 
x~ould corres!~ond t o  a concq) tuc~l  structure 0 (=> ~ , L ~ L O C :  (Cp(K) ), 
i.e. be (mentally) located in the conscious processor of K t .  
k i t h  closer attention to the sublevel(s) of vmind', a more spe- 
cif ic e%yression could b e  deternitled. For instance, an asso- 
ciation of both the P and V sublevr l s  with !tnin(J yic lds  
'think about- the t r u t h  of.. . * and ' thinlc about doing.. . '. 
In order t o  complete the parilphrase, the progrcm assumes 
thiit ther hds the silme r e f e r en t  as and notes  from the 
clef in i t ion  of 'mind1 that 'mind1 is an IPAR'J! of t h i s  referent .  
It then picks up those conceptual elements uf tcloset other than 
those describing the innermost underlying aT4%TE--(TH-L aT.bE 
(IHP +) 'SR-E)--and submits the entire l ist  of elements (he 
(IPART: mind) Tit-L STATE (HYP +) T L E  think) t o  a simple mapout 
routine. This g ives  the rlparaphroselr 'he (Ii 'AIRT: mind) STOP 
WSSIBUXTY-OF START thinkt. An a c t u a l  generator  could arrive 
at paraphrases such a s  'he stopped thinking '. 21 correspondtng 
0-role interpretation would be 'nothing ccn stcrt to b e in 
(i.e. enter) his  mindt, which is also a reasonable approximation. 
The aspect of tclosel whieh implies t h ~ t  ncthing can leavc 
rather than enter would y i e l d  'he started to keep everything in 
his mindT. This might be uwerstood- in terms of not forgetting 
or not expressing oneself. The inability of the described -
method to ident i fy  exactly which meaning is intended is the 
price of its object iv i ty  and flexibility in being able to 
arrive at an i n t e rp re tg t io i~  with no previous knowledge of 
what such phrases refer to in a givcn culture. In this  
respect the model represents the abilities of o Language-user 
who is unfamilinr with the idioms o f  the s?eskers o f  h i s  
environment. 
5. 2. Category silift 
A "category shiftu refers to the feet t h a t  instead of a 
PP or a conceptual NOMIN L, an attributive or verbal concept 
in the form of a noun appears as the  concept which has been 
assigned role 0. liore s p e c i f i c a l l y ,  these concc,~ts are either 
l'conceptual attributesu (of objects) as  repredented by 
' c o l o r 1 ,  ' t r u t h i ,  'bec.utyt, 1 , etc. ,  or attributes of 
aninxtte 11s \;hich r.~ight be described a s  iLhTAL-, bENSQ1-Y- or 
CONTROL l e v e l  VEKBs in which the focus i s  on R rather than 
on the relctionship between R and some 0, as represented by 
tconfitiencet, !perception ', 'pos;ession', etc. t;etnpl~orical 
uses involving either type  of concept often involve level 
shift, as in ' i t s  vaLue der'latedt or 'she b u i l t  up his  
confidencet. In this sense they resemble that c l a s s  of 
expressions designated simply as  "Level shift". Also, the 
procedures for interpreting the ( l e v e l -  and) category-shift 
'they decimated his joyt and the level-shift 'they decimated 
his version of the accidentt are s i m i l a r .  
However, the designation of a cata2,ory sh i f t  a l lows  
for the interpretation of the metaphorical ?hLs smile 
disintegrated*, which docs n o t  involve n level shift  in the 
sense described above. In 8 ddition, th i s  d ~ ~ s i g n  tion 
preserves the theoretical d i s t i n c t  lon bctwcen ' j o y 1  as an 
(anirnmtb) a t t r i b u t e  and the NCMINtiL '~crsion~ ('story', otc.) 
as a concept \:hich is i s o l a t e d  f Porn its anint te source, a 
distjnction which is r e a l i ~ e d  in the d e f i n i t i o n  of 0 i n  each 
cade. Rather than being defined as a N u ~ ~ ~ N A L ,  ' j o y '  or t h e  
noun *smilet is dcf ined as a noun with a bilsic V A B  s t ruc tu re  
and level. 
NOMINAL fec~tures, which are not a s  criticL.l f o r  non- 
P I I Y d I W  as for PHYSIC ,L NOMINALS, ore even loss distinguish- 
abLe for attributes. The . & N I h  TE feature divldes t he  class 
of at t r ibutcs  as described abvvc; i n  general, however, 
f e a t u r e  v.ilues nrc p r e s c ~ ~ t l y  ignored US possible rcs t r ic t ions  
on metaphorical uses of attr ibutes .  
A few examples of clitegory s h i f t  in w h i c h  the toi.ical 
focus is on an q t t r i b u t e  rather than on a human experiencer 
K, illustrate auditional po in t s  concerning metap'lorical 
in ter~retat ions .  One of t he  general problems of meta- 
phorical interpretation is to show in the re wesentation of 
a phrase the analogy to a conceptual object , as w e l l  as 
'%hat is re3119 happeningg". 
Theb in7ut  ex.irn,>le 'his sb..ile disintegratedt should 
produce the same r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  as  that of 'he stopped 
smilingt. Yet the : ~ b i l i t - y  to thus r e l a t e  these expressions 
must be b . ~ s e ~  on some underlying similarity with intuitive 
appeal. This tnslc rcrluires a verb def initi.cn procedure such 
as the  one presented here, r:hich rcsts on n sm 11 number of 
conceptual elements. The p r i m i t i v e  element of TRiNS ITIuN 
underlies 'he s t o ~ p e d  smiling , 'his smile d i s intcgm~ e d t  
and l his smile left himt, even though on tho  su r f  ncc it 
appears only t o  underlie t h e  latter ( th i rd )  form of ex- 
pren\>ion. Phis element is expressed in  our semnntic repre- 
sentation as TR-L, From there the TR-L structure could be 
incorporated into a conceptual diagram in  a number of ways, 
e 
e.g. by n t r ans i t ion  arrow I _I , by a ttcause-to-notn 
structure 9 or by a "f in i sh-ACTt t  n o t a t i o n

conceptual dependency for exampleaof the type @en. This 
notat ion does not express any relationship between the three 
forms of the exxn7le given above. Howevef, it is rnnpyed out 
oL TR-L, which does show this relatianship and is referred 
t o  in  the f o l l o w i n g  analysis of 'his  indifference disintegratedv 
Briefly, 'disintegrate ' ~s defined as changing from 
existence to non-existence of an object, on the PHYSICAL 
level :  ((PH) TTt-L (STATE 0 BE)...). since 'indifferencev 
is not consxstent wit11 the PHYSICAL l eve l ,  a base-level 
interpretation fails. Since 'he ' is +ANIIL?LTE, the IEmAL- 
l eve l  noun 'indifferencet can serve as an a t t r i b u t e  of  'het 
as ex,eriencer A. There are no feature specifications which 
m u ; t  be f u l f i l l e d  by the a t t r i b u t e  * indiffercncc ' ; theref o r e  
there crc no obstacles  t o  an intc?rprat,ition on the PiJY'l'AL 
level. Thc delfinition of 'indiffcrcncet yields the descriptors 
'((1.C A) (sT.:C& (0 r r f  R) (VAL +-))) ' ,  where 'A' represents 
iVAL, i.e. the LGNTd, sublevel 'A t t i tuder ,  and +- is the 
value ..or 'neither p o s i t i v e  nor negnt ive'. 
'mdifferencel can be defined in terms OL ei ther  the 
LTM or thc dP, i.e. either a s  +HYP or -1IYP; +IiYP is arbitrari ly 
assumed ftir non-PlNSIQi'L concepts. The program thus enters 
the matrix with dimension informarion (b& A K bTL!1'E +H +- ) to 
obtain a corres1,onding K-role VEI\D. It finds 'be-indif f erent- 
to1, uses the R nlrenriy determined as subject and adds struc- 
ture element TR-L given by the ver,b to obtain 'he STOP be- 
indifferent-to...', leaving n slot for the object of the 
indif  iercnce. 
The procedure is s i m i l n r  for 'his  smile disintegrated '. 
The mogrcm determines o cdtegory ~ h i f t  and nccet*s the TR-L 
structure f o r  'disintegratef with the Itloss of existcncell of 
0 (0 BE) interpreted as che tt loss  of sta te1 '  of ii (0 AT R). 
Thus the resulting R-role representation is the sane as t hd t  
for 'he stopped smilingt. (It might be noted t h s t  the sub- 
stitution of a concept sucha s 'smilet for n physical object 
could be represented as a P H Y S I U - t o - A C T I V C , s b i f t ,  if an 
ACTIVE level ispostulated f o r  HO3lIN~iLs snd VERBS ( 5 ) .  
pursuit of this  approach would designate this example, like 
the o the r  exmples of t h i s  section, as n case of l evL  1 s h i f t .  ) 
T ~ Q  excin~plc ' t r u t h  burned up ' is dismissed by Katz ( 3 )  
as som.,ntic:llly lous.  However, if h w n s  ctm unders tend 
sentences involving verbs which e:-lpnrently v iolnte selectional 
restrictions, tlxen such expresstons are i:lw zub jec t  to 
computer understanding. In terms oC the matr ix,  ' t r u t h  ', 
a conceptual attribute, represents a p o s i t i v e  v.:lue of on 
a t t r i b u t e  of n (lexically absent ) EC4N'i'tU ub joct ,  which is 
in t u rn  dominated by a ( lex ica l ly  absent) R. kince 'burn upt 
differs from Tdisintegratet only in t he  me.nz or manner of 
thc aation, ehe endysis of this e x ~ + m p l e  is s i m i l c j r  to t ha t  
of 'his  indifference disintegrated*, w i t h  a s h i f t  to the 
TVAL- rather than to the sublevel. By L l l o ~ i n g  for the 
assumed R and 0, the ou tpu t  r o u t i n e  con ob ta in  the opproxi- 
motion 'one STO: know.. . ( tpeople storlped knowing ) or 
one STOP ialriTE-TO t r u e  inf orrna tion ( 'people s topped

restrictions on 'burn upt would inuicnte a +PiTYSlC=rL 
NOMINAL as ac to r ,  the program st ill lluricierst andstr the usage 
while recognizing t h a t  it is not i' base or ltnormalv usage. 
T h l s  is poss ib le  because the system is01 t e s  rhe ~ r i ~ i t i v e  
structure of a verb from its ordir.sry select ional restrictions.

'Country' has tho f rliture ref uired for an R on t h e  CUNTIUL

The structurc essentially is TR-C as found in the defini t ion 
of the 0-role varb 'leap-to '. The conce:~t of 'start to b e q  
or 'become' which underlies TR-E at any l eve l  is transformed

Since ' d r i f t t  no ten t ia l ly  takes a source or @a1 as

with which it w i l l  be used. In intra-lcvei  ieature shifts, 
all components conform to the same level, usual ly  the PINSIC&,

h%en the +HNLIvGiTE feature of an ac to r  is v io la ted ,  n kind of

5.4.2. Object-feature shift  
The example 'the ship plowed the sea' f a i l s  n literal 
interpretation on the basis crf the definition of t p l ~ w t  : 
(PLOW ((1~3X3) TR-I: (bTlbE (0 BE SHAPE: ) )  (ROLE 0) (AGENT +) 
.., (IasTRt TR (STATE (O L ~ T  R))) 
(O ( N R ~  land) (B!U (212 +) (~1ml.1 + ) I )  I ) ,  
since 'scat is not a synonym for a n d  However, 'seat  
fulrills the '8rond1 specifications of 'plow' for 0. 'Shipt, 
the syntactic subject, is assigned the r o l e  c . f  AGXNT. In 
(S),  it is explained t h a t  an AGENT, i.e. n NCEIINAX which has 
some r o l e  in a causative act ion,  either 1) is  +;th'lbL.TE, 
2) i tse l f  represents an action and therefore has the ACTIVE 
level ,  or 3) hac a specific func'iisn whic i l  entor:. into the 
causation. Since 'shipf isneither +.rNIB2~'l'i: nor ACTIVE-level, 
it is assumed to have a functional role in the causing 
conceptualization. The program checks to see that certain 
ranuirements oi an instrumental involvement of 'ship1 in 
lplowing' nro fulfilled. The function Qr' vshipl is given 
as 'sai l .  '. The strucf ure ufidcrlying Js.?il is TK (:iT.;TE 
(0 AT R)). Although the noun vnlo~vt might be g i w n  as the 
cx ) l i c i t  instrument of tho verb .'olow , the program ignores 
the failure to cgree w i t h  such specific infom:a~tion, j u s t  ;AS 
it ignores Narrow restrict ions on' ob j o c t s  when considering 
metnphoricnl cx 3ressions. On examinlbg the gcncral structure 
given for the instrumental concoptunlizotian of '?low', the 
4 
program finds TR (bT.SE: (0 AT R) ) , which aI;rees vi th  the 
verb s t r u c t u r e  of the Punc tion of s . In othsr words, 
although only o 'plow' can truly '?low1, in a rneta~hor ica l  
in te rore ta t ion  anything' xhich tt~hysically goesu can con- 
ceivably h..ve a l lplow-like" ef fcct. i'hc ?rosrarn the=? o r e  
arrives at the roq:h intcrprctotion 'ship DO (sen 3 dT 
(BE SIIAPE: ) . Conceptual dcpen..ency rules would then 
transform 'ship DO' into a structure corresnonding to 
'one o7ernte sh ip ' .  
~ ~ n s i d e r  now a vzrb- - 'kill - - w ? ~ i c h  is subject: to 
metaphorical use. but in a non- straight? orword way, since 
a level shift  and/or-an - object-feature sh -ft may k involved. 
Iq the exam2Les 'John Bilged the cat' and 'the House k i l l e d  
the bill ', the ordinary object of 1 ( c c t  ) is no more 
a mere ;d~ysical ob j & c t  than t h e  metcpY.oricc1 object  (tbillt ) 
is a mere mental object. The P~?YSI~-to-i~iiW.~L extension 
in the aecond example is obscured by the simultaneous 
presence of an object-feature shift. 
To c l a r i f y  the r o l e  which each type of s h i f t  plays, a 
similar example is first presented which involves only 
ob ject-feat- s hift: 'he killed thcmotor I .  This example 
could be more explicitly paraphrased as 'he d id  something 
which caused the motar to die*, The interpretation depends 
on what it mewrr-fot the cbject. *motdrt, to 'd ie1  or 'be 
dead'. It would be deo%rablc 'to obtain the interpretation 
'he stopped the opekathn or r n i n g  of the motorv, while 
rejecting a s b - s  intcrplrtation for  'he ki l l ea  the stone1.  
*Motor* and 'stone * are,both RIYaICAL NObIINC\Ls; no l e v e l  
shift is involved. Rather, the +ANII~IYZ specification on 
the object is violated, yielding a mctaphoriccl, interpreta- 
tion in the first case and no interpretation in the second. 
?Motort is a medningful object of 'kill1 because it is a 
~ ~ I C  NOMIN L-, its function king to r u n .  ( It i s  reca l led  
from Section 3.1 that the +DYNAMIC feature value specifies a 
function which can be identiEied with the part icular  meaning 
of a NOMINAL.) When a motor is ?killeda, t h i s  func t ion  
attribute is eliminated-- a consequence which. differs from 
e.g. the disintegration of the motor  which might represent 
its being 'destroyed'. 
The proceaure of the program operating on the first two 
examples canbe outlined as follows. The semantic repre- 
sentation for 'kill is : 
(kill ( (PHYS)  TR-L (STATE (0 <FN(O)>)) (ROLL 0) (IGDIT +)  
(TRY-1 . a .  
CO (N1W (AN'IM t))) (BRD (UYN + ) )  )). 
For the exmple 'John k i l l e d  the cat I ,  the progrim w i l l  find 
t h a t  all specifications on the NOMIN &s by the definition o f  
the verb ere met by the wrds of the in3ut. In p.lrticular,  
'u 'Pttrd'n'tt is + '.~TIBk'~TE; thdt  is, in terms of DYNAMIC FUNCfIOK, 
it 'livest in a literal sense, Thus the Liter,til sense of 
'kill' 'is accepted. If the inbuttJohn killed the stonet is 
encountered, the program notes t h a t  ' stone has no r.'~NIEtiTE 
feature vCllue and therefore f a i l s  a base interpretation. 
Furthermore, 'st one isno t +DYNAMIC and theref ore does not 
sat isfy  t h e  'Broadt specif ications necessdry f o r  a mcta- 
phorical interpretation. 
The input ' the  House k i l l e d  the bill presents a more 
interesting case, '~ouse' i n  the sense of ' ~ o u s e  of Repre- 
sentative~~ or 'Lower HouseT h:*s the +ANIPLiTX feature 
preferred by the target representation condi t ions  on an 
AGE;NT as s p e c i f i e d  above- with respect to ' s h i p t ;  however, 
(bill1 does not hove the +ANINATE feature value as  required 
by 'killt. Thus a base-level interpretat ion is rejected. 
IIowever, t b i l l  does have the +DYNAPlIC v ~ l u e ,  corresponding 
t o  the observation t ha t  it has a ucontinuous effectly on people. 
Thus the bas ic  components are sa t i s f i ed  for an interpretation. 
since the dispensable 'Narrow + A N I ~ $ ~ T E  descr ip tor ,  i. e. the 
l i t e r a l  live' function, is v i o l ~ t e d ,  b ut the minimal, i. e. 
'Brood1 requirements are fulfilled, the employment of 'killt 
is considered a metaphoricill extension from the l+IIYSfCAL to 
the EZ1:NTAL level, The structure TR-L ( C L "  0 N O  ) ) 
(AGENT +) then yields the paraphrase lHouse &TOP bill become 
law', where 'lawt is n COXI'WL concept r e ~ ~ r e a c n t c d  in terms 
of lone mustt and lone nmyt. 
Gy no t i=  t h a t  which il; co\~-unon to both the base sense 
and metnphorical senses of  ' k i l l ' ,  w e  c.ln cotl-tp rc the m&nn-

t h a t  the Object no longer ~xists in its previous State, for  
this i s  t71e interuretntion assigned to the TR-L structure. 
Thus the ccit no longer lives; the o t u t o r  no longer runs; 
consideration of the bill stops,  and the - intended result,

5 .5 ,  Koun compounds 
This type of metaphor a n d y s i s  can also be  appl ied  to 
noun compounds i n  which the nouns are defined in terms of 
verb~l concepts. The further ~.evelopment of  the above rnech- 
animsms must precede an implementation o f  the more coclplex 
now-compound metaphor analysis ; however, the =.p,n-oach t o  
interpretation of such constructs can be indicated. An 
example is given by the noun compound idea factoryt, \.hich 
is close in nleoning to t h e  verb-noun cdmnound ' th ink tankt. 
If the +I'llfolU~L objects or mc:tter usuL. l ly  asvociatcd with 
f :;ctory or 'tank1 arc ignored, noun-coml~ound i n t c r ~ x x t , ~ t i o n  
pr0cedurc.s (5) can be used to arrive at ' i n s t i t u t i o n  which 
m~kes $deasl or lcnvironment in which one thinksq r e s p e c t i v e l y .  
Ncre tllc verb ' th ink and the noun ' idea  ' , which is an objec t  
ot thought,  retain their  l i tcrcl l  srnsa, 'c~!~ereus the functions 
underlying 'factory ( tmalcc ) and ' t nnk ( be in ' ) undergo an 
n b ~ ; t r , ~ c t i o n  prqcess similar to t h a t  involved in l e v e l  shift. 
Consider a l s o  the esarnple ' the  foreign-born may hold the  
\nzi te IIousc key socnt .  It: is poss ible  to uncierstnnd *I..%ite 
House key1 in i t 8  metaphorical sense because: 'keyt 5s a 
NOBIINAL described ,is having the iunction ' own  ' ; ' opening 
t i m p l i e s  the possibility of enteringv (cT. ' c l o s e  ', section 
5 . 1  and ' bite  Hou;c * is not only a A I T ~ L & &  building,  b u t  
is also defined w i t h  the fectures of $n institution, which 
includes ANIbdfE beings. Thus the f rclmework exists i o r  
handling some metap i~o r i ch l l y  used noun constructs with 
underlying verbal and/or ettribvtive concepts. 
The examples of Sections 5.1-5.4 are representative of 
t he  v ~ r i o u s  metaphor mech:tnisms which have been identified. 
The (;uestion arises as to the extent to which such mechanisms 
hold for any metaphorical use of a verbal or a t t r i b u t i v e  
concept. An assessment of the v a l i d i t y  of the nnClysis 
method f o r  such metaphorical uses depends upon 1) the com- 
pleteness of t h o  identified ca t ego r i e s ,  i.e. whether such 
categories cover all types of verbs in the  c lass  under 
cons idera t ion;  2 )  whether ~ u c h  ca t ego r i e s  cre based on the 
most "importantH component which enters into metaphorical  
extensions; and 3 )  the extent t o  ~ h i c h  v: .r iot ions within a 
category af~ect the  plausibility of a n  i n t e r p r e t c t i c n .  The 
first two condi t ions  a r e  concerned.r:itk thc quootion of 2 
"rninirn4lM interpret'.tion, i. e. thc exclusion of n :!lscfl 
interpretation, the t h i r d  with an "adequate" i n t e r p r e t  ation. 
With tespect to the first point, the Verb description 
system presented has intenticnnlly focused on the breauth 
o r  scope of the categorization r d h e r  t h m  on 2. more deta i l ed

c h a r a c t e r i d i n &  eler~~ents of a verb i n  t h e  sense t h .  t the

uistic c o n s t r u c t s  not  u s u a l l y  thought o f  a s  m e t c ~ h o r i c a l .  
~ l t h o u g h  a phrase such as 'he reached > r o s p e r i t y t  i s  not 
obviously metaphorical, there is  c "tr~nsl~ ti:ntt between it 
and the phrasc 'he became prosperous which is similar to 
the translation between the more coLor iu l  'he l eapt  to  
prosperityt and 'he became (suddenly) prosperoust. In 
each cnsc,  the p r imi t ive  TK-E representing 'start t o 1  
relhtes the two forms of the expression. 'l'his simi1: l r i ty  
rests on the f ac t  that - a l l  l i n g u i s t i c  expressions which 
treat abstractions (lprosperous') as objects ( 'prosperity' )  
might in a sense be considered metaphorical. It seems 
reasonable to ap roach the problem of metaphor with an 
anelysis valid f o r  the simplest form of such expressions. 
The analysis represented by the structural descriptors is 
t r i v i a l  but basic  in th'lt it is a prerequisite to any more 
complete interpretation, and in t h a t  it relates expressions 
exhibiting varying degrees of metaphor withou t  resorting t o  
ad hoc definitions or rules. 
Although they provide a basic interpret~t-iirn, t he  
structures and features whic7?  render an extension meaningful 
are not necessarily, the focus of a metaphoric21 expression. 
The focus moy be an attribute which, while provided for and 
broauly classif ied by t h e  structure-lcvcl d c i i n i t i o n  of t h e  
verb, ittielf rul~nins to bc dof ined. To tr:kc n r. t h e r  d i f f i c u l t

be desircble t o  know how the attribure itself enters into

Thus it can be concluded t h a t  tlte method prcsentcd

It i s  oc' s ibmificance t h a t  the emphasis on inclusive classes

of thc system. Inter~rctationsproduced on the basis of rela- 
tively rninimd informat ion will not ~ l w a y s  be completely 
satisfactory, nor will they 7rovide all t h e  nuances of l ing-  
uistic expression. However, the possibility t h a t  interpre- 
tations of  L lerge c l a s s  of m e t a p ~ o r i c o l  exjressions can be 
approximated by a systematic analysis  of tlze concepts involved 
ensures f u r t h e r  opportunities t o  aevelop computer understanciing 
of novel expressions.
