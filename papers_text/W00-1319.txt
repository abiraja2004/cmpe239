Abstract 
This paper introduces an intuitive search 
environment for casual and novice Chinese 
users over Internet. The system consists of four 
components, a concept network, a query 
reformulation model, a standard search engine, 
and an automatic summarizer. When the user 
enters one or more fairly general and vague 
terms, the search engine returns an initial 
answer set, and at the same time pipes the query 
to the concept network that connects thousands 
of conceptual nodes, each referring to a specific 
concept for a given domain and pointing to a 
number of associated conceptual terms. If the 
concept is located in the network, the related 
conceptual terms are displayed. The user has the 
option of using one or more of these specific 
terms to reformulate he next round of searches. 
Such search iterations continue until the user' s 
ultimate information seeking goal is reached. 
For each search iteration, auto summarizer 
presents the main theme of the document 
retrieved and an optional text-to-speech engine 
can read out the output summary if the user 
prefers. 
1. Introduction 
Internet is changing the world, and at the same 
time changing people' s information seeking 
behaviour. Traditionally, information searchers 
are trained professionals working in libraries or 
other special technical or scientific fields. They 
have developed a variety of  techniques and 
heuristics for addressing information seeking 
difficulties in the environment typically 
dominated by Boolean query formula. These 
Boolean information retrieval systems are 
normally commercial and non-interactive 
systems and the searches conducted in such 
settings are exact-match and set-based retrieval 
from databases of indexed citations and 
abstracts of documents (Koenemann and Belkin, 
1996). With the dramatic explosion of 
information sources over Internet, current user 
population isno longer estricted to' professional 
searchers. Practically it includes everyone in 
life. The majority of these users, however, are 
either casual or novice or both. Casual users, 
such as browsers of news stories, look for 
interesting information rather than information 
relevant o a specific need (Stadnyk and Kass, 
1992). Novice users may have a specific 
information topic, but due to little or no training 
in search and retrieval, they don' t know how 
to make best use of the available operators and 
tools. On the whole, query formulation is one 
problem facing both types of information users 
(Turtle, 1994). Internet users all have difficulty 
in mapping their intent to any logical query 
structure. They prefer limiting their searches to 
one or a simple list of terms, while seeking help 
from the system to guide them to achieve their 
ultimate information goal. 
In this paper we introduce an integrated system 
that combines a standard search system with a 
query reformulation model, a pre-constructed 
concept network, an automatic document 
summarizer, and an optional text-to-speech 
(TTS) engine. Together, these intelligent 
components provide intuitive human 
intelligence to the Chinese users over Internet. 
The integrated system not only guides and 
navigates the user to perform searches in a 
humanly conversational way, but also makes 
and delivers the retrieved information back to 
the user in a simple, succinct, and easily 
comprehensible manner. 
2. System Configuration 
Figure 1 and Figure 2 present the overall system 
configuration and data flow of the integrated 
system. The system consists of four main 
components: a concept net, a query 
148 
reformulation model, a standard search engine, 
and a summarizer. There is also an optional 
component, i.e., if the user chooses, she can 
launch a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to read out 
the automatically generated summary. 
The concept net is a network of conceptual 
terms. It is normally constructed for a specific 
domain with certain amount of human 
intervention. A link connects each pair of 
related concepts in the network, specifying the 
semantic relationship between them. For the 
current economic news domain, the main types 
of relationships include, but not limited to, 
canonical form of, synonym of, hyponym of, 
hypernym of, part of, product of, member of, 
etc. 
The system accepts users' queries expressed in
Chinese natural language. The query may 
contain the terms that are already stored in the 
concept network. Unlike professional searchers, 
Most of Chinese web users have little training in 
information retrieval or have no prior 
knowledge or experience in it. They may not 
even know where to search and how to search. 
To perform an initial search, they tend to use 
one or more very general or vague terms. Under 
such circumstances the system guidance and 
navigation are extremely important. One unique 
functionality of this integrated system is to 
intuitively lead a casual or novice user from a 
more general search to a more specific search 
until the user becomes satisfied with the 
returned information. 
For each search conducted, the query 
reformulation model looks up the concept 
network for more specific terms that are relevant 
to the more general terms in the earlier query. 
For example, if a general term is a company' s 
name, then its subsidiaries, its products, its stock 
symbol, its industrial code, etc. are considered 
to be specific information about the company. 
The query reformulation model either replaces 
or expands the original query with these related 
terms and formulates them into a standardized 
format. Search operators, such as AND, OR, 
NOT, NEAR, etc. are used to connect the terms 
selected. Assigned to each individual term is a 
different weight so as to reshape a new search 
emphasis. 
The standard search engine performs the search 
against the targeted database using the 
reformulated query with N relevant documents 
returned in an order of  the relevance to the 
query (N is a number defined by the user and it 
is 10 by default). At the same time, the concept 
terms in the original query and the 
corresponding specific terms extracted from the 
concept network are also displayed. The web 
interface is designed in a way that makes each 
of the specific terms searchable. The user has 
the choice to select any of these specific terms 
to form a new query. The search engine takes 
the new query to perform the next round of 
search, actually a more specific search based on 
the user' s intention. The iteration continues - 
the more specific search while using more 
specific terms, the closer the user will be to his 
desired information - though he can stop 
anytime after each search iteration to examine 
the retrieved ocuments. 
A text summarizer automatically generates the 
summaries for the documents each search 
iteration returns (Liu and Zhou, 2000). Together 
with the output summary, a selection panel that 
includes the key-word list (average 3 to 6 
words), the headline, and the leading text 
(usually the first 100 characters) of the 
document is displayed. The selection panel 
provides the user with an ability of examining 
the retrieved information more efficiently. By 
glancing over the key words, the user should be 
able to grasp the main idea of the document. He 
can make a decision whether to skip the 
document or continue to learn more about it. If 
his choice is the latter, he can move up to the 
headline or the leading text that offer more 
about he document content. He can, of course, 
move further to look at the summary that is 
supposedly a mini-document of the original. I f  
the user decides to move further to read the 
entire document, then he will click on the 
hyperlinked title or headline of the document. 
The integrated system will go directly online, 
usually a specific website, to grab the document 
for the user. 
Associated with the summarizer is an optional 
text-to-speech (TTS) engine. The user can 
choose either to read the document himself or 
get relaxed by simply listening to the system' s 
voice output.

3. An Example 
Summarization 
Search and 
In this section we use an example to illustrate 
how the integrated system works. 
Suppose that here is a Chinese user who has no 
experience in search over Internet, neither has 
any idea regarding where or how to do it. He 
just heard some news about F~ (Legend, one 
of the biggest computer manufacturing 
companies in China) and wants to find it out 
from Internet. When we make our integrated 
search and summarization system available to 
him, the only word in his mind is the name of 
the company ~,~ (Legend). So, he enters this 
fairly general term as his fast search query and 
presses the Go button (see Figure 3 (a)). 
Figure 3 (b) shows what the integrated system 
returns to the user in response to his initial 
150 
search. In addition to the top 10 most relevant 
documents, two more specific terms are 
extracted from the pre-constructed concept 
network, i.e., t I~ \ [ \ ]  (Legend Corporation) 
and I~,flgJ\]~ (Legend computer). In the 
concept network these two terms are found to be 
closely associated with the initial search 
termF~,~., (Legend). When the user examines 
the top relevant document returned, he fmds that 
a selection panel is displayed on the interface 
that is associated with this (or each) returned 
document. If looking up from the last row, he 
notices three key words that are extracted from 
the document, i.e., ~ \ [ \ ]  (Legend 
Corporation), ?d,-T:~_~ B\](electronic company), 
~1~ ~)~- (internationally well-known 
brand). By putting these three key words 
together the user should be able to grasp the 
main idea expressed in the document 
(something like "Legend Corporation is an 
electronic company who has some 
internationally well-known brand names" ). I f  
the user wants to know more about the 
document, he can move up to click the button 
f l~3~J  (automatic summarization) or read 
the leading text (in this case the first 50 
characters from the document are extracted). If
the user wants to refer to the entire document, 
he can do it by clicking on the headline. The 
integrated system will go live to Internet o 
retrieve the entire original text. 
But, what if the user is not satisfied with the 
current answer set? Then, he has an option of 
kicking off another ound of  search. To do that 
he may want to narrow down his search by 
choosing between ~o~,~-,~ \[\] (Legend 
Corporation) and I~f~ f l~  (Legend 
computer) - the two relatively speaking, more 
specific terms associated with his initial query 
I~  (Legend). Let us suppose that the user 
decides to select 1~?3.~ \[\]  (Legend 
Corporation) to conduct a new but more 
specific search. The search can be activated by 
simply clicking on this selected term. Figure 3 
(e) shows the results of this search iteration. 
Again, in addition to the top 10 most relevant 
documents returned, more than 20 related terms 
are extracted in this round from the concept 
network that are considered to be conceptually 
relevant o the search termID~,~..,~\[\] (Legend 
Corporation). These terms represent even more 
specific concepts comparing to the two specific 
terms returned in the first round. A detailed 
examination of these terms reveals that they 
represent the following conceptual categories: 
first, more specific news or information about 
the company, such as ~\ [ \ ] IT~3 l r  (the head of 
Chinese 1T), ?P~-T~'~f3~~" (No. 1 of the 
first 100 most powerfil electronic companies in 
China), \ ]~L~ (Joint venture of Legend 
and CA) and ~ t ~  (Happy Family, a 
software kit); the products of Legend 
Corporation, such as F~*~;{~ (Legend 
motherboard), ~,~..~'f~ (Legend software), 
~ ~  (Legend Chinese card); the 
management of Legend company, such as 
F~,~,~J~ (president of Legend), I~,~,~lJ,~,~ 
(vice-president of Legend); and other related 
corporations, such as ~i~:.~ll~\[~ (business 
corporation), ~f13~ (electronic 
corporation), I.~L~ \[\] (industrial 
corporation), and ~ /~ \[\] (Haier 
Corporation). At this point, the user has another 
option. He can go through the selection panel 
associated with each retrieved ocument to see 
which document contains the information he 
wants. If so, his search iteration will terminate. 
If  not, he can reformulate his next search by 
selecting any one or more terms from the 
specific term list. In this particular case, the user 
may go for the first choice since the top 
document retrieved turns out to be identical for 
these two search iterations conducted so far. The 
document entitled J.~ZJ~ll/kJl~!~3-~qF0~ 
~1~I~~ (Reorganization of Legend 
Corporation to welcome the joining of WTO) 
receives the relevance rate of 100% in both 
searches. This is probably the news about 
Legend Corporation the user is looking for. 
As mentioned above, even if the user has 
obtained the information he desires, he still can 
reformulate or expand his next search for more 
specific news about ~ (Legend Corporation). 
Also, the user can launch a completely new 
search for another company. Remember 
~J~/F~\[\] (Haier Corporation), another most 
powerful company in China, appears in the 
specific term list. By clicking on this term, the 
user will be able to locate the latest news or 
other information about a new company.

4. Conclusion 
This paper presents an intuitive search system 
for casual or novice Chinese users on specific 
websites. Instead of describing the algorithmic 
portions of each component, we focus on 
illustrating the overall system design and how 
the integrated system works and serves the end- 
users. The presented system provides human 
intelligence to the user who desires to seek 
relevant information over Interact. It does not 
assume that the user receives any training in 
search and retrieval or has any prior experience 
in using Internet. The user can start his search 
with a general and vague term or idea. The 
integrated system will guide the user from a 
general search to a series of more specific 
searches until he is fully satisfied with the 
information returned. Our survey states that the 
existing search systems, especially those in the 
Chinese market, are still dominated by key term 
search mechanism. This integrated system 
presents a new paradigm. It provides a concept- 
driven search environment that allows the user 
to manipulate the semantic relationships 
between the original query terms with its 
associated terms. We have so far built two 
applications based on two specific domains. The 
preliminary results have demonstrated that the 
integration of a concept network, a query 
reformulator, a standard search algorithm, an 
auto summarizer, and an optional TTS engine 
indeed suits the current information seeking 
behavior and make search activities in websites 
more intuitive, as well as productive.
