Given the prominence of the lexicon in most current (3) 
!inguistic theories (I.FG, HPSG, GB), lhe inventory of 
language particular information left in the lexicon 
teserves special  attention. Construct ing large 
computerized lexicons remains a difficult problem, 
milding a large array of apparently arbitrary information. 
I'his papers shows that this arbitrariness can bc 
mn,;trained more than might have been previously 
hought. In particular, arbitrariness of argument slructure, Bengali 
xord sense, and paraphrasability will be shown not only (4) 
o be constrained, hut also to be integrally rchttcd. Our 
radical) view is that wu'iation of lexical behavior across 
anguages is exactly like lexical variation within 
anguages, specifically, the difference lies in the presence 
~r absence of certain morphemes. For cxatnple, the fact 
hat Japanese has richer possibilities it\] certain verbal 
mtterns is derived solely from its morphological  (;reek 
nventory. ~ Put another way, language parameters (5) 
;imply are the presence or absence of lexical material in 
he morphological  componet\]t. Observed hmguagc 
~ariation patterns reflect morphological systematicity. 
I'he generative machinery for producing argutnent 
;tructure positions is fixed across languages.

A striking example underscoring universality of

All of these hmguages have exactly the same alternation 
type. Why? Let us locus orl tilt role of  f igure and 
ground 3 in lhese examples. By "alternation", we mean 
that in each language they}'~,,ure, asexpressed as a direct 
object in the (a) cases, alternates wilh the fi'gure as 
expressed in an equivalent PP in the (b) cases, l)espite 
the differences in word order and case marking, all share 
the properly that the direct object is subject o a so-called 
l lolistic l~,ffect: 4 Crucially, tim (a) sentences differ from 
the (b) sentences in exactly the same way in each of 
these languages. In (lb), where John loads the wagon 
with hay, the wagon is understood to have a wl_jole load 
of hay, likewise if John smears the wall with paint, the

action represented by the verb. By 'figure', we mean the object 
that is brought into contact with tile ground, l:or example, in (1), 
the hay is the figure which is brought into contact with the wagon, 
in tills case, the ground. See Tahny (1978) and Emends (1991) for 
discussion of figure and ground in this connection.

say, the case of the direct (~bject is. See l,evin (1993) and the 
references there for additional discussion of the Holistic l",ffect.

wall is understood to have more paint than if John merely 
smears paint on the w~dl. Thus we may assume throughout 
that the word sense of  the verbs as used in the (a) and 
(b) cases are essentially identical, s The goal of the 
remainder of  this paper is to analyze and implement this 
insight in a particular representation given by both 
linguistic and computational theory, and apply it to MT. 
Basic Building Blocks: The Syntax of  Word  Formation 
We propose to replace idiosyncratic language p,'u'ticular 
information with a new generative component that links 
universal abstract lexical structures with the surface 
that derives words from a small set of primitives) These 
structures are assumed to be identical across languages.

Crucially, only a restricted number of  argument 
structures can be generated. The basic idea is that lexical 
X-bar structures are composed from the lexical categories 
N, A, V, and P (see fig. 2), into trees whose Spec(ifier) 
and Comp(lement) positions after movement yield the 
range of possible ,argument structures. The lexical entries 
are subject o a series of filters, as follows.

N (Noun) = entity ? Move-Alpha 
A (Adjective) = state (including Head 
V (Verb) = event Movement)

To give a concrete xample of the system, we derive 
the thematic properties of  the denominal verb shelve 
from compositional machinery operative in the lexicon 
by composing the noun form shelf with an empty 
preposition and an empty verb to yield the form shelve. 
The structures are as shown in Fig. 2. In short, argument 
structure is produced by syntax operative in the lexicon 
s If an interlingua-based system does not constrain the number of 
word senses, it faces some serious computational problems as is 
shown in section 3. 
Fig. 3 shows the detailed schema for producing 
lexical entries for verbs. We only note briefly here a 
few important properties of  the system in Fig. 3. First 
of all, the main verb V is formed by Head Movement 
of  X, and Y if it exists, to V. The categorial wdue of X 
and Y are selected from the set {N,A,V,P}. For example, 
the denominal verb shelve is built as shown above iv 
One can view the work by Dor. (1993) and, previously, ethel 
attempts at lexical decomposition ranging hack through Scbank a~ 
essentially the same in spirit, bt, t without the detailed constrai)m 
provided by Figure 2. Wc regard similar proposals regardin~ 
"promotion" and "demotion" of arguments as essentially a reflectior 
of Move-:llpha. The novelty of our proposal is that it is not ad hoe 
that is, the same constraints independently justified in syntax all 
appear in lexic:d constructioll. The need for at non-arbitrary, i.e., ar 
explanatory, account of lexical argument structure should b( 
apparent. If lexical entries varied arbitrarily, we would Iogicall~ 
expect at least he following space of lexical possibilities, requMn 1
upwards of a quarter-million diacritics. Let m be the number o 
semantic/thematic roles, such as Agent, Patient, Theme, Range 
Duration, and so on, and let n be tbe number of grammatical functions 
Then, when n=4 and m=50 (a typical number for traditional NLI 
systems) we have 251,176 differenttypes of lexical entries (Zi=0 t( 
n m/li!(m-i)! ). While some theories might propose this man 
distinctions, it seems clear that Ibis imposes a very considerabl 
learning and engineering burden. Many researchers, includin 
Makino (1991) and others, have noticed tim drawbacks of encodin 
thematic rules, but in the absence ofa clear alternative, still requir 
them for representing lexical intormation. Furthermore, it is commo 
knowledge that verbs pattern into certain equiwdence classes withi 
languages (e.g., Levin, 1993), but arbitrary verb classes woul 
imply arbitrary variatkm across languages.

Analysis and Applications for the Universal Lexicon 
Computational Motivation. 
There have been some controversies about the merits 
md demerits of transfer-based MT and interlingua-based 
MT. Typical transfer-based MTs prepare completely 
Jifferent sets of word senses for component languages 
~o that mapping among the word senses is completely 
arbitrary, i.e., the complexity may be calculated as 
~ipartitc graph matching. We will assume an interlingua- 
9ased MT, which supposedly makes all the component 
angt, ages share common word senses or so-called 
:oncepts and thus is constrained regarding word senses. 
\[towever, interlingua-based MT still has substantial 
)roblems in making up word senses. The number of 
0vorcl senses, their well-definedness, and the p,oblem 
about linking surface words depend on excellent 
.exicographers. To give just one example here, the 
:filingual dictionary Sanseedoo (1990) lists all the 
{bllowing English translations tbr a Japanese verb kazaru 
Wecorate) 
"h~,~?7~ : 
kazaru: ornament; decorate; adorn; dress; 
embellish; exhibit; display; put articles on show; 
affect; be affected; grace a ;use fair words; write 
an inflated style; mince; not being plain or flat 
21ustering these into well-defined word senses is not an 
.-asy task; thus, it is hard to answer the word sense 
.luestion. Suppose we have a symbol to represent the 
:ore meaning of kazaru, which is shared by the English 
counterpart decorate. Since kazaru has the syntactic 
nature of a Spray/Load type alternation, the lexicon of a 
typical interlingua-based MT essentially provides the 
information described below.

KAZARU-DECORATE

\ [MATERIAL\]WlTH(~) } 
Verb Alternation Type 2: 
{ \[AGENT\]NOM(/0::), ITHEME\]ACC(~),  
\[ GOAL\]DAT/ON/OVEI~. (}E.)} 
AGF, NT, THEME, GOAL and MATERIAL are 
thematic roles that are the key elements in the interlingua. 
NOM, ACC, WITII and DAT/ON/OVER are case- 
marking functions mapped to the surface case markers ' 
/Y;', '~r',  '-Q:' and '~C'. Assuming a self-contained 
thematic role system and case-marking system, these 
markings are to be ewtluated on the corresponding 
example sentences and be decided independent of each 
other. I Iowever, the two argument structures in the above 
diagram are actually incolnpatible with each other because 
the same thematic role THEME is assigned to different 
referents: grotmd, the patient o be decorated, andfigure, 
the decoration to be attached to the patient. In effect, 
the MT system makes serious errors clue to its confusion 
of thematic roles derived from tim lexicon. 
Example Input: 
(6) 
Output: 
Taro-ga hana-o kazatta. 
Taro-NOM flower-ACC decorate-PRF 
Taro decorated the flower. 
In most contexts, the default reading of the inpnt 
sentence above should be interpreted as 'Taro decorated 
something with flowers.' This error was caused by the 
semantic lash in the lexicon. In order to avoid such 
errors, lexicographers could overwrite some thematic 
roles disregarding semantic riteria, but thus would spoil 
the interlingual \[oundalion. The remaining possible 
sohltion t%r this problem is to artificial divided the word 
sense (WS) into two syinbols: WSwith and WSon, two 
completely artifical word senses. 
Those two artil'icial word senses are essentially very 
similar to each other, if not identical, and will pose 
difficulties for lexicographers because they will have to 
put arbitrary links among word senses for similar words 
in two languages or within the same language. The two 
word senses put the two different argument structures in 
complete isolation once the analysis is completed and 
tim interlingua is fixed; the only thing the generation 
module of MT can do is accept the given word sense 
(WSwith or WSon)and generate only one argnment structure. 
This rigidity has a potential to generate sentences that 
245 
are unacceptably unnatural. 
The result for MT and lexicon construction is that the 
computational machinery will stay fixed across languages 
and thus uniformly constrain the complexity of argument 
structures eliminating most of the related arbitrariness. 
It is well known that word-for-word translations are 
not the paradigmatic case. The architecture we propose 
entails a significant improvement in isomorphic mappings 
between languages. However, the isomorphism is not at 
the level of words, but rather, at the level of morphological 
elements that enter into the lexical syntactic formation 
of  words. Thus it is no accident hat 'put the book on 
the shelf' is a near paraphrase of  'shelve the book',  and 
it is no accident that 'put the book on the shelf' is a 
closer isomorphic map for the Japanese translations of 
' John shelved the book'  shown in (1). The entailment is 
that 'shelve the book' has the same morphological material 
as 'put the book on the shelf' ,  but the former has an 
empty preposition and an empty verb that incorporates a 
noun. 
In particular, we show how to replace thematic roles 
with the lexical syntax proposed in Hale and Keyser 
(1993) and augmented by work in Pustejovsky (1991 a)\] 
This technique yields several potential benefits: (i) 
robustness of  the lexicon, (ii) greater flexibility in 
selecting more natural renditions of  target language 
structures in translation, as in (7) below. Let us consider 
each of these in turn with specific examples. 
(7) a.John-wa hon-o tana-no ue-ni oi-ta. 
John-TOP book-ACe shelf-GEN upper place-AT put-PRI ~ 
John put the book on the shelf. 
b.John-wa hon-o tana-ni simatta. (more accurate) 
John-TOP book-ACC shelf-DAT pt, t.away-PRF 
John put away / stored the book on the shell'. 
if  paraphrasability and translation must conform to 
the lexical syntactic structures in Figures 2 through 4, 
we have a natural method for producing a constrained 
space of possible translations, namely, the only structures 
that are allowed are those produced by thc mechanism 
outlined in Fig. 4. To highlight the relationship between 
paraphrasabi l i ty  and transhttabil ity, consider the 
alternation behavior of  several verbs within English, 
shown in (2). Notice in particular that different verbs 
participate in one or both halves of  the alternations, or 
in neither half. As we will see, the same facts hold 
across distinct languages. 
Nonalternat ion:  
Not all verbs that participate in one half of the 
Spray/Load alternation participate in the other half, as 
(8) and (9) and (10) from English, Japanese, and Hindi 
illustrate. Interestingly, in these cases verbs across 
VAlong with Emonds (1992), we propose shifting a significant 
portion of the machinery out of the semantics and into syntax, in 
the |brm of syntactically enriched lexical entries. 
languages also pattern alike in terms of nonalternation ~. 
This gives additional support for our representation 
proposal.

he correct lexical representation for tim verbs and hence 
he structures that translate a more direct mapping across 
anguages. We propose that the key to the solution is 
hat in the non-alternating cases, prepositions are 
rworporated into the verb in lexical syntax just as shelve 
n Fig. 3. For exmnple, the lexical entries for pout, and 
'over contain prepositions as shown in (10). We assume 
hat the lcxical representation for the prepositions encodes 
peeifications for figure and ground, represented as F 
~nd G in (10). In essence, whatX on Y means is that X 
afigure on the ground Y. ht fact, this is tim essence 
~f what prepositions "mean", at an abstract level. Thus 
he prepositions are the primitives in our system, and 
oncepts uch as figure and ground are deriwttive. This 
ntaihnent is illustrated by the linking lines in Fig. 5. 
cover(X,Y)+with(G,F) 
Fig. 5 An Explanation For The Spray-Load 
Alternation 
The lexical entry for load does not contain a preposition 
nd hence is free to alternate. Thus the reason why a 
erb does not participate in part of an alternation ix that 
: incorporates lexical material which clashes with 
otential complements. The reason that 'cover the blanket 
n the baby' is bad is that covet" already encodes the 
igure and ground relationship by incorporating with into 
:s representatoin--that is, he preposition with is frozen 
"lto the verb's representation. Adding an overt PP with 
n creates aclash in figure and ground relations. Adding 
compatible PP to a verbal structure with an incorporated 
' introduces redundancy, but is the structure ix still well- 
:~rmed. 
alternation Mismatches Across Languages. 
So far, then, we have seen only that verbs across 
iffcrent languages pattern alike. Surely the,e must be 
'ifferences or else MT efforts wonld have succeeded 
:rag ago . Fig. 6 displays all the logically possible 
~lationship between verbs across two languages. 
Types A, F, and K verbs behave identically in a 
language pair. For example, the introductory sentences 
(1)-(5) illustrated Type A correspondences, where 
L,=English and L2c {Japanese,Hindi,Bengali,Greek}. 9 
We have found (B,C,G,E,I,H) - - the  unshaded cells 
in the Figure 5--to be the richest source of cross-linguistic 
information, namely, the verbs that do not con'espond 
directly are the most informative regarding the nature of 
word formation, given the model that we have adopted. 
Not accidentally, they are precisely the ones that arc not 
only of particular interest for our framework, they arc 
polentially very difficult for machine translation, simply 
because, for some of them, the,'e is no way to take 
advantage of the surfitce similarity of argument structures. 
Recall that wc assume that the word sense for these 
verbs ix fixed across hmguages. Consider, then, the 
Type C alternation correspondence below, where 
L,=English and 1,2< { Japanese,Hindi,Bengali } : 
'~(21carly, type P verbs should constitute most of the verbal 
w~cabnlary, since most verbs do not participate in the Spray/Load

these verbs do not exist, given the considerations regarding likely 
candidates across languages.

In Hindi, one can replace dhaknaa ('cover') with 
dakh-denaa ('give cover'). This morphological change 
turns a type F alternation contrast into a type B, as 
described in Fig. 6.

Put briefly, our view is that variation of lexical 
t:~ehavior across languages is exactly like lexical 
wtriationwithin languages, specifically, the difference 
lies in the presence or absence of certain morphemes. 
Ontologically speaking, then, what language parameters 
are is the presence or absence of lexical material in the 
morphological  component.  The observed patterns in 
language variation is then reflected in morphological  
systematicity. For example, the fact that Japanese has 
richer possibilities in certain verbal patterns is derived 
from its morphological inventory. In specific, the reason 
that it is impossible for English verbs to behave like 
certain corresponding Japanese verbs is that English lacks 
an equivalent of tim Japanese aspectual morphetnes 
ts'ukusu 'exhaust' ,  kakeru ' trajectory verb',  etc) ~ But 
recall, we find that load, for example does behave 
precisely like its corresponding verbs in Japanese, llindi, 
Bengali, and Greek. in cases where verbs do m)t 
appear to behave alike, apparent differences are resolved 
hy a process of language particula," morphological  
behavior: lor example, the verbal suffixes (and prefixes) 
of Japanese such as - t sukusu 'exhaust '  alter verb 
argument  structure enough to bring them into 
cor respondence with their former Engl ish non- 
counterparts. 
Conclusion 
We believe that our approach is applicable universally. 
Future work to be done is to complete our survey o1' the 
approximately 150 types of verbal alternations of Levin 
mlt might be tmderstood pragmatically to entail that perhaps the 
parents were wo,'ried about covering the baby too much, and wanted 
to allow the baby to breathe asily by allowing its bead, Ibr example, 
to remain uncovered. In brief, here it is the compositional belmvior 
of morphemes that yields different alternation pa!adigms. 
(1993), and augment our analysis with further ideas from 
Hale and Keyser (1993), Pustejovsky (1990, 1991 b), and 
others, and to extend the coverage to Japanese and other 
languages. Our highly constrained system should also 
prov ide  h igh ly  des i rab le  c i rcumscr ip t ion  of  
computational lexicons. Given the universal aspects of 
our lexical representations, we also expect manageable 
applications to machine translation, along the lines that 
we have suggested.
