Abstract
We propose an unsupervised method for au-
tomatically calculating word usage similar-
ity in social media data based on topic mod-
elling, which we contrast with a baseline dis-
tributional method and Weighted Textual Ma-
trix Factorization. We evaluate these meth-
ods against a novel dataset made up of human
ratings over 550 Twitter message pairs anno-
tated for usage similarity for a set of 10 nouns.
The results show that our topic modelling ap-
proach outperforms the other two methods.
1 Introduction
In recent years, with the growing popularity of so-
cial media applications, there has been a steep rise
in the amount of ?post?-based user-generated text
(including microblog posts, status updates and com-
ments) (Bennett, 2012). This data has been iden-
tified as having potential for applications ranging
from trend analysis (Lau et al, 2012a) and event de-
tection (Osborne et al, 2012) to election outcome
prediction (O?Connor et al, 2010). However, given
that posts are generally very short, noisy and lack-
ing in context, traditional NLP approaches tend to
perform poorly over social media data (Hong and
Davison, 2010; Ritter et al, 2011; Han et al, 2012).
This is the first paper to address the task of lexi-
cal semantic interpretation in microblog data based
on word usage similarity. Word usage similar-
ity (USIM: Erk et al (2009)) is a relatively new
paradigm for capturing similarity in the usages of
a given word independently of any lexicon or sense
inventory. The task is to rate on an ordinal scale the
similarity in usage between two different usages of
the same word. In doing so, it avoids common issues
in conventional word sense disambiguation, relating
to sense underspecification, the appropriateness of a
static sense inventory to a given domain, and the in-
ability to capture similarities/overlaps between word
senses. As an example of USIM, consider the fol-
lowing pairing of Twitter posts containing the target
word paper:
1. Deportation of Afghan Asylum Seekers from
Australia : This paper aims to critically evalu-
ate a newly signed agree.
2. @USER has his number on a piece of paper
and I walkd off!
The task is to predict a real-valued number in the
range [1, 5] for the similarity in the respective us-
ages of paper, where 1 indicates the usages are com-
pletely different and 5 indicates they are identical.
In this paper we develop a new USIM dataset
based on Twitter data. In experiments on this dataset
we demonstrate that an LDA-based topic modelling
approach outperforms a baseline distributional se-
mantic approach and Weighted Textual Matrix Fac-
torization (WTMF: Guo and Diab (2012a)). We
further show that context expansion using a novel
hashtag-based strategy improves both the LDA-
based method and WTMF.
2 Related Work
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of
determining the particular sense of a word from a
given set of pre-defined senses (Navigli, 2009). It
248
contrasts with word sense induction (WSI), where
the senses of a given target word are induced from
an unannotated corpus of usages, and the induced
senses are then used to disambiguate each token us-
age of the word (Manandhar et al, 2010; Lau et
al., 2012b). WSD and WSI have been the predomi-
nant paradigms for capturing and evaluating lexical
semantics, and both assume that each usage corre-
sponds to exactly one of a set of discrete senses of
the target word, and that any prediction other than
the ?correct? sense is equally wrong.
Erk et al (2009) showed that, given a sense in-
ventory, there is a high likelihood of multiple senses
being compatible with a given usage, and proposed
USIM as a means of capturing the similarity in us-
age between a pairing of usages of a given word.
As part of their work, they released a dataset, which
Lui et al (2012) recently developed a topic mod-
elling approach over. Based on extensive experi-
mentation, they demonstrated the best results with
a single topic model for all target words based on
full document context. Our topic modelling-based
approach to USIM builds off the approach of Lui
et al (2012). Guo and Diab (2012a) observed that,
when applied to short texts, the effectiveness of la-
tent semantic approaches can be boosted by expand-
ing the text to include ?missing? words. Based on
this, they proposed Weighted Textual Matrix Factor-
ization (WTMF), based on weighted matrix factor-
ization (Srebro and Jaakkola, 2003). Here we ex-
periment with both LDA based topic modeling and
WTMF to estimate word similarities in twitter data.
LDA based topic modeling has been earlier studied
on Twitter data for tweet classification (Ramage et
al., 2010) and tweet clustering (Jin et al, 2011).
3 Data Preparation
This section describes the construction of the USIM-
tweet dataset based on microblog posts (?tweets?)
from Twitter. We describe the pre-processing steps
taken to sample the tweets in our datasets, outline
the annotation process, and then describe the back-
ground corpora used in our experiments.
3.1 Data preprocessing
Around half of Twitter is non-English (Hong et al,
2011), so our first step was to automatically identify
English tweets using langid.py (Lui and Bald-
win, 2012). We next performed lexical normaliza-
tion using the dictionary of Han et al (2012) to con-
vert lexical variants (e.g., tmrw) to their standard
forms (e.g., tomorrow) and reduce data sparseness.
As our target words, we chose the 10 nouns from
the original USIM dataset of Erk et al (2009) (bar,
charge, execution, field, figure, function, investiga-
tor, match, paper, post), and identified tweets con-
taining the target words as nouns using the CMU
Twitter POS tagger (Owoputi et al, 2012).
3.2 Annotation Settings and Data
To collect word usage similarity scores for Twitter
message pairs, we used a setup similar to that of
Erk et al (2009) using Amazon Mechanical Turk:
we asked the annotators to rate each sentence pair
with an integer score in the range [1, 5] using sim-
ilar annotation guidelines to Erk et al We ran-
domly sampled twitter messages from the TREC
2011 microblog dataset,1 and for each of our 10
nouns, we collected 55 pairs of messages satisfying
the preprocessing described in Section 3.1. These
55 pairs are chosen such that each tweet has at least
4 content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and ad-
verbs) and at least 70+% of its post-normalized to-
kens in the Aspell dictionary (v6.06)2; these restric-
tions were included in an effort to ensure the tweets
would contain sufficient linguistic content to be in-
terpretable.3 We created 110 Mechanical Turk jobs
(referred to as HITs), with each HIT containing 5
randomly-selected message pairs. For this annota-
tion the tweets were presented in their original form,
i.e., without lexical normalisation applied. Each HIT
was completed by 10 ?turkers?, resulting in a total
of 5500 annotations. The annotation was restricted
to turkers based in the United States having had at
least 95% of their previous HITs accepted. In total,
the annotation was carried out by 68 turkers, each
completing between 1 and 100 HITs.
To detect outlier annotators, we calculated the av-
erage Spearman correlation score (?) of every an-
notator by correlating their annotation values with
every other annotator and taking the average. We

of these restrictions on the resulting dataset.

accepted all the annotations of annotators whose av-
erage ? is greater than 0.6; this corresponded to 95%
of the annotators. Two annotators had a negative
average ? and their annotations (only 4 HITs to-
tal) were discarded. For the other annotators (i.e.,
0 ? ? ? 0.6), we accepted each of their HITs on
a case by case basis; a HIT was accepted only if
at least 2 out of 5 of the annotations for that HIT
were within ?2.0 of the mean for that annotation
based on the judgments of the other turkers. (21
HITS were discarded using this heuristic.) We fur-
ther eliminated 7 HITS which have incomplete judg-
ments. In total only 32 HITs (of the 1100 HITs com-
pleted) were discarded through these heuristics. The
weighted average Spearman correlation over all an-
notators after this filtering is 0.681, which is some-
what higher than the inter-annotator agreement of
0.548 reported by Erk et al (2009). This dataset is
available for download.
3.3 Background Corpus
We created three background corpora based on data
from the Twitter Streaming API in February 2012
(only tweets satisfying the preprocessing steps in
Section 3.1 were chosen).
ORIGINAL: 1 million tweets which contain at least
one of the 10 target nouns;
EXPANDED: ORIGINAL plus an additional 40k
tweets containing at least 1 hashtag attested in
ORIGINAL with an average frequency of use of
10?35 times/hour (medium frequency);
RANDEXPANDED: ORIGINAL plus 40k randomly
sampled tweets containing the same target
nouns.
We select medium-frequency hashtags because low-
frequency hashtags tend to be ad hoc and non-
thematic in nature, while high-frequency hash-
tags are potentially too general to capture us-
age similarity. Statistics for ORIGINAL and EX-
PANDED/RANDEXPANDED are shown in Table 1.
RANDEXPANDED is sampled such that it has the
same number of tweets as EXPANDED.
4 Methodology
We propose an LDA topic modelling-based ap-
proach to the USIM task, which we contrast with
a baseline distributional model and WTMF. In all
these methods, the similarity between two word us-
ages is measured using cosine similarity between the
vector representation of each word usage.
4.1 Baseline
We represent each target word usage in a tweet as a
second-order co-occurrence vector (Schu?tze, 1998).
A second-order co-occurrence vector is built from
the centroid (summation) of all the first-order co-
occurrence vectors of the context words in the same
tweet as the target word.
The first-order co-occurrence vector for a given
target word represents the frequency with which that
word co-occurs in a tweet with other context words.
Each first-order vector is built from all tweets which
contain a context word and the target word catego-
rized as noun in the background corpus, thus sensi-
tizing the first-order vector to the target word. We
use the most frequent 10000 words (excluding stop-
words) in the background corpus as our first-order
vector dimensions/context words. Context words
(dimensions) in the first-order vectors are weighted
by mutual information.
Second-order co-occurrence is used as the context
representation to reduce the effects of data sparse-
ness in the tweets (which cannot be more than 140
codepoints in length).

models by predicting ?missing? words on the ba-
sis of the message content, and including them in
the vector representation. Guo and Diab showed
WTMF to outperform LDA on the SemEval-2012
semantic textual similarity task (STS) (Agirre et al,
2012). The semantic space required for this model
as applied here is built from the background tweets
corresponding to the target word. We experimented
with the missing weight parameter wm of WTMF
in the range [0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0005] and with di-
mensions K=100 and report the best results (wm =
0.0005).
4.3 Topic Modelling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003)
is a generative model in which a document is mod-
eled as a finite mixture of topics, where each topic is
represented as a multinomial distribution of words.
We treat each tweet as a document. Topics sensi-
tive to each target word are generated from its corre-
sponding background tweets. We topic model each
target word individually,4 and create a topic vector
for each word usage based on the topic allocations of
the context words in that usage. We use Gibbs sam-
pling in Mallet (McCallum, 2002) for training and
inference of the LDA model. We experimented with
the number of topics T for each target word ranging
from 2 to 500. We optimized the hyper parameters
by choosing those which best fit the data every 20 it-
erations over a total of 800 iterations, following 200
burn-in iterations.
4Unlike Lui et al (2012) we found a single topic model for
all target words to perform very poorly.

5 Results
We evaluate the above methods for word usage sim-
ilarity on the dataset constructed in Section 3.2. We
evaluate our models against the mean human ratings
using Spearman?s rank correlation. Table 2 presents
results for each method using each background cor-
pus. The results for LDA are for the optimal set-
ting for T (8, 5, and 20 for ORIGINAL, EXPANDED,
and RANDEXPANDED, respectively). LDA is su-
perior to both the baseline and WTMF using each
background corpus. The performance of LDA im-
proves for EXPANDED but not RANDEXPANDED,
over ORIGINAL, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our hashtag based corpus expansion strategy.
In Figure 1 we plot the rank correlation of LDA
across all words against the number of topics (T ).
As the number of topics increases beyond a certain
number, the rank correlation decreases. LDA trained
on EXPANDED consistently outperforms ORIGINAL
and RANDEXPANDED for lower values of T (i.e.,
T <= 20).
In Table 3, we show results for LDA over each tar-
get word, for ORIGINAL and EXPANDED. (Results
for RANDEXPANDED are not shown but are similar
to ORIGINAL.) Results are shown for the optimal
T for each lemma, and the optimal T over all lem-
mas. Optimizing T for each lemma gives an indica-
tion of the upperbound of the performance of LDA,
and unsurprisingly gives better performance than us-

ing a fixed T for all lemmas. This suggests that ap-
proaches that learn an appropriate number of topics
(e.g., HDP, (Teh et al, 2006)) could give further im-
provements; however, given the size of the dataset,
the computational cost of HDP could be a limitation.
Contrasting our results with a fixed number of
topics to those of Lui et al (2012), our highest rank
correlation of 0.29 (T = 5 using EXPANDED) is
higher than the 0.11 they achieved over the origi-
nal USIM dataset (where the documents offer an or-
der of magnitude more context). The higher inter-
annotator agreement for USIM-tweet compared to
the original USIM dataset (Section 3.2), combined
with this finding, demonstrates that USIM over mi-
croblog data is indeed a viable task.
Returning to the performance of LDA relative
to WTMF in Table 2, the poor performance of
WTMF is somewhat surprising here given WTMF?s
encouraging performance on the somewhat similar
SemEval-2012 STS task. This difference is possi-
bly due to the differences in the tasks: usage simi-
larity measures the similarity of the usage of a tar-
get word while STS measures the similarity of two
texts. Differences in domain ? i.e., Twitter here
and more standard text for STS ? could also be a
factor. WTMF attempts to alleviate the data spar-
sity problem by adding information from ?missing?
words in a text by assigning a small weight to these
missing words. Because of the prevalence of lexical
variation on Twitter, some missing words might be
counted multiple times (e.g., coool, kool, and kewl
all meaning roughly cool) thus indirectly assigning
higher weights to the missing words leading to the
lower performance of WTMF compared to LDA.
6 Summary
We have analysed word usage similarity in mi-
croblog data. We developed a new dataset (USIM-
tweet) for usage similarity of nouns over Twitter.
We applied a topic modelling approach to this task,
and contrasted it with baseline and benchmark meth-
ods. Our results show that the LDA-based approach
outperforms the other methods over microblog data.
Moreover, our novel hashtag-based corpus expan-
sion strategy substantially improves the results.
In future work, we plan to expand our annotated
dataset, experiment with larger background corpora,
and explore alternative corpus expansion strategies.
We also intend to further analyse the difference in
performance LDA and WTMF on similar data.
