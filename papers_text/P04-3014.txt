Abstract
We present an improved method for automated word
alignment of parallel texts which takes advantage
of knowledge of syntactic divergences, while avoid-
ing the need for syntactic analysis of the less re-
source rich language, and retaining the robustness of
syntactically agnostic approaches such as the IBM
word alignment models. We achieve this by using
simple, easily-elicited knowledge to produce syntax-
based heuristics which transform the target lan-
guage (e.g. English) into a form more closely resem-
bling the source language, and then by using stan-
dard alignment methods to align the transformed
bitext. We present experimental results under vari-
able resource conditions. The method improves
word alignment performance for language pairs such
as English-Korean and English-Hindi, which exhibit
longer-distance syntactic divergences.
1 Introduction
Word-level alignment is a key infrastructural tech-
nology for multilingual processing. It is crucial for
the development of translation models and transla-
tion lexica (Tufis?, 2002; Melamed, 1998), as well as
for translingual projection (Yarowsky et al, 2001;
Lopez et al, 2002). It has increasingly attracted at-
tention as a task worthy of study in its own right
(Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003; Och and Ney, 2000).
Syntax-light alignment models such as the five
IBM models (Brown et al, 1993) and their rela-
tives have proved to be very successful and robust
at producing word-level alignments, especially for
closely related languages with similar word order
and mostly local reorderings, which can be cap-
tured via simple models of relative word distortion.
However, these models have been less successful at
modeling syntactic distortions with longer distance
movement. In contrast, more syntactically informed
approaches have been constrained by the often weak
syntactic correspondences typical of real-world par-
allel texts, and by the difficulty of finding or induc-
ing syntactic parsers for any but a few of the world?s
most studied languages.
Our approach uses simple, easily-elicited knowl-
edge of divergences to produce heuristic syntax-
based transformations from English to a form
(English?) more closely resembling the source lan-

guage, and then using standard alignment methods
to align the transformed version to the target lan-
guage. This approach retains the robustness of syn-
tactically agnostic models, while taking advantage
of syntactic knowledge. Because the approach relies
only on syntactic analysis of English, it can avoid
the difficulty of developing a full parser for a new
low-resource language.
Our method is rapid and low cost. It requires
only coarse-grained knowledge of basic word order,
knowledge which can be rapidly found in even the
briefest grammatical sketches. Because basic word
order changes very slowly with time, word order of
related languages tends to be very similar. For ex-
ample, even if we only know that a language is of
the Northern-Indian/Sanskrit family, we can easily
guess with high confidence that it is systematically
head-final. Because our method can be restricted
to only bi-text pre-processing and post-processing,
it can be used as a wrapper around any existing
word-alignment tool, without modification, to pro-
vide improved performance by minimizing alignment
distortion.
2 Prior Work
The 2003 HLT-NAACL Workshop on Building and
Using Parallel Texts (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003)
reflected the increasing importance of the word-
alignment task, and established standard perfor-
mance measures and some benchmark tasks.
There is prior work studying systematic cross-

linguistic structural divergences, such as the DUSTer
system (Dorr et al, 2002). While the focus on ma-
jor classes of structural variation such as manner-of-
motion verb-phrase transformations have facilitated
both transfer and generation in machine translation,
these divergences have not been integrated into a
system that produces automatic word alignments
and have tended to focus on more local phrasal varia-
tion rather than more comprehensive sentential syn-
tactic reordering.
Complementary prior work (e.g. Wu, 1995) has
also addressed syntactic transduction for bilingual
parsing, translation, and word-alignment. Much of
this work depends on high-quality parsing of both
target and source sentences, which may be unavail-
able for many ?lower density? languages of interest.
Tree-to-string models, such as (Yamada and Knight,
2001) remove this dependency, and such models are
well suited for situations with large, cleanly trans-
lated training corpora. By contrast, our method re-
tains the robustness of the underlying aligner to-
wards loose translations, and can if necessary use
knowledge of syntactic divergences even in the ab-
sence of any training corpora whatsoever, using only
a translation lexicon.
3 System
Figure 1 shows the system architecture. We start
by running the Collins parser (Collins, 1999) on the
English side of both training and testing data, and
apply our source-language-specific heuristics to the

resulting trees. This yields English? text, along with
traces recording correspondences between English?
words and the English originals. We use GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2000) to align the English? with the
source language text, yielding alignments in terms
of the English?. Finally, we use the traces to map
these alignments to the original English words.
Figure 2 shows an illustrative Hindi-English sen-
tence pair, with true word alignments, and parse-
tree over the English sentence. Although it is only
a short sentence, the large number of crossing align-
ments clearly show the high-degree of reordering,
and especially long-distance motion, caused by the
syntactic divergences between Hindi and English.

eliminated, and the alignment is now monotonic.
Table 1 shows the basic word order of three major
phrase types for each of the languages we treated. In
each case, our heuristics transform the English trees
to achieve these same word orders. For the Chinese
case, we apply several more language-specific trans-
formations. Because Chinese has both prepositions
and postpositions, we retain the original preposition
and add an additional bracketing postposition. We
also move verb modifiers other than noun phrases to
the left of the head verb.
4 Experiments
For each language we treated, we assembled
sentence-aligned, tokenized training and test cor-
pora, with hand-annotated gold-standard word
alignments for the latter1. We did not apply any
sort of morphological analysis beyond basic word to-
kenization. We measured system performance with
wa eval align.pl, provided by Rada Mihalcea and
Ted Pedersen.
Each training set provides the aligner with infor-
mation about lexical affinities and reordering pat-
terns. For Hindi, Korean and Chinese, we also tested
our system under the more difficult situation of hav-
ing only a bilingual word list but no bitext available.
This is a plausible low-resource language scenario

and a test of the ability of the system to take sole
responsibility for knowledge of reordering.
Table 3 describes the test sets and shows the cor-
relation in gold standard aligned word pairs between
the position of the English word in the English sen-
tence and the position of the source-language word
in the source-language sentence (normalizing the po-
sitions to fall between 0 and 1). The baseline (di-
rect) correlations give quantitative evidence of dif-
fering degrees of syntactic divergence with English,
and the English? correlations demonstrate that our
heuristics do have the effect of better fitting source
language word order.
5 Results
Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 show learning curves for sys-
tems trained on parallel sentences with and with-
out the English? transforms. Table 2 provides fur-
ther detail, and also shows the performance of sys-
tems trained without any bitext, but only with ac-
cess to a bilingual translation lexicon. Our sys-
tem achieves consistent, substantial performance im-
provement under all situations for English-Hindi
and English-Korean language pairs, which exhibit
longer distance SOV?SVO syntactic divergence.
For English-Romanian and English-Chinese, neither
significant improvement nor degradation is seen, but
these are language pairs with quite similar sentential
word order to English, and hence have less opportu-
nity to benefit from our syntactic transformations.
6 Conclusions
We have developed a system to improve the per-
formance of bitext word alignment between English
and a source language by first reordering parsed
English into an order more closely resembling that

of the coarse basic word order of the source lan-
guage, such as can be obtained from any cross-
linguistic survey of languages, and requiring no pars-
ing of the source language. We applied the sys-
tem to the task of aligning English with Hindi, Ko-
rean, Chinese and Romanian. Performance improve-
ment is greatest for Hindi and Korean, which exhibit
longer-distance constituent reordering with respect
to English. These properties suggest the proposed
English? word alignment method can be an effective
approach for word alignment to languages with both
greater cross-linguistic word-order divergence and an
absence of available parsers.
