Abstract
This paper introduces the task of automatical-
ly  answering  clinical  comparison  questions 
using MEDLINE? abstracts. In the beginning, 
clinical  comparison  questions  and  the  main 
challenges in recognising and extracting their 
components  are  described.  Then,  different 
strategies for retrieving  MEDLINE?  abstracts 
are shown. Finally, the results of an initial ex-
periment judging the relevance of MEDLINE? 
abstracts  retrieved by searching for the com-
ponents  of  twelve comparison  questions  will 
be shown and discussed.
1 Introduction
Clinicians  wishing  to  practice  evidence-based 
medicine need to keep up with a vast amount of 
ever changing research to be able to use the current 
best evidence in individual patient care (Sackett et 
al.,  1996).  This  can  be difficult  for  time-pressed 
clinicians, although methods such as systematic re-
views, evidence summaries and clinical guidelines 
can help to translate research into practice. 
In a survey commissioned by Doctors.net.uk, 
97% of  doctors  and  nurses  said that  they  would 
find  a  Question  Answering  (QA) Service  useful, 
where they can ask questions in their own words 
(Bryant  and  Ringrose  2005).  Studies  have  also 
shown that clinicians often want answers to partic-
ular questions,  rather than getting information on 
broad topics  (Chambliss & Conley,  1996;  Ely  et 
al., 1999, 2005).                                            
A type of question that  clinicians  commonly 
want answered are comparison questions. In a cor-
pus of clinical questions collected from the Nation-
al  Library  of  Health  (NLH) Question Answering 
Service  (http://www.clinicalanswers.nhs.uk),  ap-
proximately  16% of  the  4580  questions  concern 
comparisons of different drugs, different treatment 
methods or different interventions as in (1).
(1) Have any studies directly compared the ef-
fects of Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone on the 
liver?
Despite the frequency of comparison questions 
in  the  clinical  domain,  there  are  no  clinical  QA 
methods specially designed to answer them. This 
paper  introduces  the  task  of  answering  clinical 
comparison questions,  focusing  initially  on ques-
tions  involving  comparisons  between drugs.  Sec-
tion 2 presents an overview of comparative struc-
tures  and  Section  3,  relevant  previous  work  on 
clinical question answering and the computational 
extraction  of  comparisons.  Section  4  discusses 
strategies  for  retrieving  MEDLINE?  abstracts  in-
volving comparisons. Section 5 presents the results 
of  an initial  experiment  judging the  relevance of 
MEDLINE?  abstracts, which are then discussed in 
Section 6.
2 Background
2.1 Indicators of Comparative Constructions
153
In  order  to  identify  questions  about  comparisons 
that should trigger special purpose search and ex-
traction mechanisms, as well as identifying explicit 
comparisons made in text, one needs to recognize 
constructions  commonly used to express compar-
isons in English (i.e. similarities and/or differences 
between two or more entities).  In this  paper,  the 
term ?entity? refers to drugs, treatment methods or 
interventions, and the initial focus of the work is 
on  comparative  questions  in  which  two or  more 
drugs or interventions are compared with respect to 
a particular criterion such as efficacy in treating a 
certain disease. This reflects their common occur-
rence in the NLH corpus.
    Comparisons can appear in either a comparative 
form or a superlative form. The comparative form 
is used to compare two or more entities  with re-
spect  to  a  certain  attribute.  The superlative  form 
compares or contrasts one entity with a set of other 
entities and expresses the end of a spectrum. The 
following examples illustrate the difference:
Comparative form: 
Is  Ibuprofen better  than  Paracetamol for  
treating pain?
Superlative form: 
 Is Ibuprofen the best treatment for pain?
Friedman  (1989)  developed  one  of  the  first 
computational  treatments  of  comparative  struc-
tures.  Comparisons  are  challenging  because  they 
correspond to  a diverse  range of  syntactic  forms 
such as coordinate or subordinate conjunctions, ad-
verbial  constructions  or  wh-relative-like  clauses. 
Comparisons are cross-categorical and encompass 
adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs. Adjectives and 
adverbs  indicating  comparisons  occur  in  the  fol-
lowing patterns:
Comparative adjectives and adverbs:
Regular adjectives and adverbs: 
ADJ/ADV -er (e.g. safer) [[as/than]1 X] [for Y]
Irregular adjectives and adverbs: 
e.g. worse/better [[as/than] X] [for Y]
Analytical adjectives and adverbs: 
e.g. less/more ADJ/ADV [than X] [for Y]
1As/ than are optional. For example see ?A or B: What is 
safer??
Superlative adjectives and adverbs:
Regular adjectives and adverbs:
ADJ/ADV -est (eg. safest) X [for Y]
Irregular adjectives and adverbs:
e.g. worst/best X [for Y]
Analytical adjectives and adverbs:
e.g. least/most ADJ/ADV X [for Y] 
Comparisons can also be expressed in other parts 
of speech. In the NLH corpus the following exam-
ples occur:
Verbs: compared to/with, differ from
Nouns: comparison, difference
Conjunctions: versus/vs, or and instead of
With  respect  to  their  semantics  (and  hence, 
with respect to other phrases or constructions they 
may appear  with)  comparatives  can be  scalar or 
non-scalar and express either equality or inequality 
between  the  compared  entities.  (Superlatives  are 
absolute and the notion of scalability and equality 
does not apply to them).
Scalar adjectives and adverbs refer to attributes 
that can be measured in degrees, implying a scale 
along which entities can be arrayed. Non-scalar ad-
jectives and adverbs refer to attributes that cannot 
be  measured  in  degrees.  Equality refers  to  con-
structs  where  two or more compared  entities  are 
equal  in respect  to  a  shared  quality,  whereas  in-
equality emphasises the difference between entities 
in respect to a certain quality.  
Table 1 gives an example showing the four pos-
sibilities for drugs and interventions.
Scalability Equality Example
+ + As efficient as x
- + Same intervention as x
+ - Better treatment than x
- - Drug x differs from drug y
Table 1. Features of comparatives.
The difference between  scalar and  non-scalar 
comparisons plays an important role as far as auto-
matic  processing  of  comparative  constructions 
with  SemRep  (Rindflesch  and  Fiszman,  2003; 
Rindflesch et al, 2005) is concerned. This will be 
discussed in Section 3.1.

Regular expressions based on the given patterns 
for adjectives and adverbs and on the other parts of 
speech  shown above,  as  well  as  their  respective 
part-of-speech tags, were used to extract a subset 
of  comparison questions  from a corpus collected 
from the National Library of Health Question An-
swering Service website at http://www.clinicalan-
swers.nhs.uk, as described in Section 2.3.
2.2 The NLH QA Service
The NLH Question Answering service (QAS) was 
a on-line  service that  clinicians  in the UK could 
use to ask questions, that were then answered by a 
team  of  clinical  librarians  from  Trip  Database 
Ltd.2, founded by Jon Brassey and Dr Chris Price. 
The questions and their answers were then retained 
at the website and indexed by major clinical topics 
(e.g.  Cancer,  Cardiovascular  disease,  Diabetes, 
etc.)  so  that  clinicians  could  consult  the  QA 
archive to  check whether  information relevant  to 
their own clinical question was already available.
While the NHS QAS service was discontinued 
in 2008, its archive of questions and answers was 
integrated  into  ATTRACT3,  the  Welsh  National 
Public Health Service run by Jon Brassey. The aim 
of  both services has been to provide answers in a 
clinically relevant time frame using the best avail-
able evidence.
From the NLH QAS archive,  a total of 4580 
unique Q-A pairs of different degrees of complexi-
ty were collected for 34 medical fields representing 
questions asked and answered over a 36 month pe-
riod. These were put into an XML format that sep-
arated the questions from the answers, while co-in-
dexing them to indicate their association.
2.3 The Comparison Question Corpus
 
    A sub-corpus specifically of comparison ques-
tions was created by POS-tagging the questions of 
the  initial  corpus with the Penn Treebank tagset, 
using the TnT tagger (Brants 1999).  Regular ex-
pression  were  then  used  to  search  the  tagged 
corpus for  tagged lexical  elements  that  indicated 
the constructions noted in Section 2.2. 
2http://www.tripdatabase.com/index.html
3http://www.attract.wales.nhs.uk/
Some  questions  were  initially  retrieved  more 
than once because these questions contained more 
than  one  tag  which  was  a  comparison  indicator. 
These duplicates were removed. There may be oth-
er  comparative  questions  that  might  have  been 
missed  because  of  POS  tagging  errors.  A  small 
number  of  false  positives  were  removed  during 
manual  post-processing.  False positives were due 
to the fact that not all words tagged as superlatives 
are proper comparisons, but idiomatic expressions, 
such as ?best practise?, or proportional quantifiers 
(Huddleston  and  Pullum,  2002)  such  as  ?Most 
NSAIDs?. (Scheible (2008) distinguishes eight dif-
ferent classes in which the superlative construction 
is used in English but only five of the eight classes 
involve true comparisons.) The result is a subset of 
742 comparison questions out of the the total cor-
pus of 4580 Q-A pairs.

3 Related Work
As the focus of this paper is biomedical text,  the 
discussion here is limited to the work done in this 
context.  Section 3.1 will present work on finding 
assertions  involving  comparisons  in  MEDLINE? 
abstracts  and Section 3.2 will  show work on an-
swering clinical questions about comparisons.
3.1  Interpretation of Comparative Structures 
(Fiszman et al, 2007) describes work on auto-
matically interpreting comparative constructions in 
MEDLINE? abstracts. They use an extension of an 
155
existing  semantic  processor,  SemRep (Rindflesch 
and Fiszman, 2003; Rindflesch et al, 2005), from 
the Unified Medical Language System resources to 
construct  semantic  predications  for  the  extracted 
comparative expressions. 
Fiszman et al concentrate on extracting ?struc-
tures  in  which  two drugs  are  compared  with re-
spect to a shared attribute?, such as a drug?s effica-
cy in treating a certain condition, illustrated in the 
following in example:                                     
(3) Losartan was more effective than atenolol 
in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mor-
tality in patients with hyptertension,  diabetes,  
and LVH.                                           
[Example (20) in (Fiszman et al 2007)]
The  drugs'  relative  merits  in  achieving  their 
purpose  is  expressed  by  positions  on  a  scale. 
Words like than, as, with, and to are cues for iden-
tifying compared terms, the comparison scale and 
the relative position of the compared entities on the 
scale.
    Fiszman et al focused on extracting the drug 
names, the scale and the position on the scale as il-
lustrated in the SemRep representation from exam-
ple (1):
(4) Losartan COMPARED_WITH Atenolol
Scale: Effectivness
Losartan HIGHER_THAN Atenolol            
[Example (21) in (Fiszman et al 2007)]
The overall  F-score for the SemRep performance 
on the test set is 81% .
Fiszman et al do not deal with questions, nor 
with identifying the basis of the comparison or the 
population in this paper, both of which are impor-
tant  for  generating  relevant  answers  for  clinical 
questions.  However,  as  Fiszman  and  Demner-
Fushman have pointed out (personal  communica-
tion), it is possible to identify the basis of the com-
parison and the population. Two drugs function as 
arguments to the TREATS predicate, which identi-
fies the disease that is the basis for the comparison. 
SemRep can also identify the population using the 
predicate  PROCESS_OF.  For  the  question  ?Is 
treatment  A better  than  treatment  B  for  treating 
disease C in  population D??, SemRep would pro-
duce the following representation for the basis of 
the comparison (C) and the population (D):
    A TREATS C
    B TREATS C
    C PROCESS_OF D
There is an essential limitation to SemRep, how-
ever: Its comparative module only considers scalar 
comparative constructions, as presented in  Section 
2.1. Non-scalar comparisons, e.g. comparisons like 
?Is X the same intervention as Y?? or ?How does 
drug X differ from drug Y?? cannot be extracted 
using SemRep. Also, the SemRep algorithm only 
recognises entities which occur on the left and the 
right side of the comparison cue and hence cannot 
recognize  comparisons  in  which  both  compared 
entities are to the right side of the comparative cue 
as in ?Which is better: X or Y??. This means that 
different  methods are needed in order to  process 
non-scalar comparisons  and  scalar comparisons 
that  cannot  be recognized because of their  struc-
ture. In future work, rules will be defined for the 
different  syntactic  structures  in which  non-scalar 
comparisons and scalar comparison with both enti-
ties on the same side of a comparative cue can oc-
cur to serve as a basis for argument extraction dur-
ing parsing.
There  may  also  be  problems  with  ?Wh-?  or 
?anything? questions (e.g. ?What is better than X 
for treating Y?? or ?Is there anything better than X 
for  treating  Y??),  because  ?Wh-words?  or  ?any-
thing?  do  not  have  a  type  that  can  be  mapped. 
While  Question  Typing   might  solve  such  prob-
lems, the point is that questions involving compar-
isons raise somewhat different  problems than as-
sertions, which I will have to deal with in the work 
being carried out here.
3.2   Answering Clinical Questions
  Demner-Fushman  and  Lin  (2006)  address  su-
perlative clinical questions of the type ?What is the 
best treatment for X? by using a hybrid approach 
consisting of information retrieval and summariza-
tion. 
Demner-Fushman and Lin?s  task  breaks  down 
into subtasks of  identifying the drugs using UMLS 
concepts, clustering the abstracts for the drugs us-
ing  UMLS semantic  relationships  and  creating  a 
short summary for each abstract by  using the ab-
stract title and outcome sentence. They focus  pri-
marily on synthesising correct answers from a set 
156
of  search  results  consisting  of  MEDLINE? cita-
tions. 
   The system (Cluster condition) performs well 
compared  to  the  baseline,  which  consists  of  the 
main interventions from the first three MEDLINE? 
abstracts retrieved by the manual PubMed queries. 
In a manual evaluation, only 20% of the drugs for 
the  baseline  were  evaluated  as  beneficial,  com-
pared to 39% for the Cluster condition. 60% of the 
PubMed  answers were judged as ?good? in com-
parison to 83% for the  Cluster condition.
The system orders the clusters by size, equating 
the most popular drug with the best drug. While 
this assumption is not always correct, the authors 
have observed that drugs that are studied more are 
more likely to be beneficial. In addition, while this 
approach  might  work  for  questions  of  the  form 
?What is the best drug for X?? it cannot be used to 
answer other superlative questions such as Exam-
ples (5) or (6), because looking for the most stud-
ied drugs will not provide an answer to the ques-
tion which drug has the fewest  side effects  or is 
safest to use.
(5) Which drug for treating X has the fewest  
side effects?
(6) Which drug is safest to use for treating X?
Despite this shortcoming, however, Demner Fush-
man and Lin?s  work of implementing  an end-to-
end QA system for superlatives provides a model 
for all future work in this area.                                 
4 Strategies  for  Retrieving  MEDLINE? 
Abstracts  
As with (Fiszman et al, 2007) and (Demner-Fush-
man and Lin 2006),  the current work starts with 
information  retrieval.  In  particular,  exploratory 
manual  searches  were  first  carried  out  via  the 
OVID? portal to see if MEDLINE? abstracts are a 
useful  resource  for  answering  comparison  ques-
tions  such  as  ?Is  drug  A better  than  drug  B for 
treating X??
With the assistance of a medical librarian from 
the  University  of  Edinburgh?s  Information  Ser-
vices, different strategies to achieve the best possi-
ble  retrieval  of  relevant  abstracts  were  tried  out. 
Two separate cases were considered: comparisons 
involving  very  popular,  well-studied  drugs  and 
ones involving other drugs. First, strategies for the 
former  will  be described  and  illustrated  with the 
following example question:
(7) Is paracetamol better than ibuprofen for re-
ducing fever?      
Titles and abstracts were searched for each com-
pared entity  (paracetamol and ibuprofen) and the 
basis of the comparison (fever).  Then, the results 
were combined to return only abstracts containing 
both entities and the basis of the comparison. We 
found that search precision could be increased by 
limiting  the  search  to  comparative  study,  using 
OVID's  publication  type  limit.  That  is,   all  ab-
stracts that mention all three terms (i.e. the entities 
and the basis of the comparison) in the title or ab-
stract  involve  relevant  comparisons.  The  most 
common sources that were excluded by constrain-
ing the search to comparative studies are reviews, 
evaluation  studies  and  case  reports.  These  may 
contain relevant  information  but  the  initial  focus 
was on the study type that was most likely to in-
crease  precision.  (As  the  experiment  reported  in 
Section 5 and discussed in Section 6 shows, the re-
striction  to  comparative  studies  is  insufficient  to 
guarantee relevance.) 
Constraining the search to comparative studies 
has  somewhat  different  effects,  depending  on 
whether  the  drugs  mentioned  in  the  search  are 
well-studied or not.
For popular, well-studied drugs, looking for the 
drug names often leads to hundreds of returned ab-
stracts, most of which are not relevant. By includ-
ing the  basis  of  the  comparison and limiting  the 
study type to comparative studies, the number of 
returned abstracts  for a set of 30 questions drops 
on average to 15% of the size of the original set of 
returned abstracts. For Example (7) a search for the 
combination of both drug names retrieved 593 ab-
stracts.  Including the basis of the comparison de-
creased  the  number  to  139  abstracts.  After  con-
straining  the  results  to  comparative  studies,  the 
number of retrieved abstracts dropped to 24, which 
is a reduction of 83%.
For  less-studied  drugs,  the  difference  in  num-
bers of abstracts retrieved by including the basis of 
the comparison and limiting the search to the com-
parative study publication type is smaller compared

to the numbers  retrieved by only looking for the 
drug names, because fewer abstracts exist for these 
drugs, but the relevance of the returned abstracts 
improves as considerably as for the more studied 
drugs. (Recall was not analyzed during the explo-
rations because for answering clinical questions the 
relevance of the retrieved abstracts is more impor-
tant than retrieving all possible abstracts.)
There have also been cases where including the 
basis of the comparison leads to the return of no 
relevant abstracts. In this case, different strategies 
from the one discussed above will be necessary. 
Often drugs are known under generic names or 
the basis of the comparison is related to symptoms 
which are not explicitly mentioned in the question 
but which are still relevant. In order to recognise 
that different terms are actually related to the same 
drug or disease and belong to the same hierarchy, 
advantage was taken of OVID?s ability to map the 
entities  to  their  corresponding  MeSH  (Medical 
Subject  Headings)  terms and  to  ?explode?  the 
MeSH terms to include  all of the narrower, more 
specific subheadings during the search.
So far the focus has been on manual retrieval 
of abstracts. The described search strategy of com-
bining  search terms  and  restricting  the  results  to 
the specific publication type could have been done 
using a  search engine which implements Boolean 
operators and is capable of indexing XML docu-
ments  However,  the  description  of  the  search 
strategy  and  the  presentation  of  the  intermediate 
searches,  which  would  have  been  performed  in-
ternally by a search engine, was regarded import-
ant to illustrate the impact of adding the basis of 
the comparison and the use of a publication type 
limit on the number of retrieved abstracts.

5 Judging  the  Relevance  of   MEDLINE? 
Abstracts
A initial experiment was carried out to evaluate the 
relevance  of  the  abstracts  retrieved  from  MED-
LINE? via Ovid?  using the strategies described in 
the previous section. 
The experimental  subjects  were  eight  4th  year 
medical  students,  who evaluated the abstracts  re-
trieved for twelve clinical comparison questions in 
which two drugs were compared to each other with 
respect to a particular attribute. The questions dif-
fer in syntactic structure, but they all contain com-
parisons of two drugs. Figure 1 shows the list of 
questions.
The material presented to the medical students 
in  the  experiment  was  created  as  follows: 
The drug names and the basis of the comparison 
from the natural language questions were manually 
mapped  to  their  corresponding  MeSH terms  and 
used to retrieve abstracts via OVID? using the final 
strategy described in Section 4.. 
For any question, the maximum number of ab-
stracts  given to the  student  judges was 15,  com-
prising up-to-15 of the most recent abstracts. In to-
tal,  each judge evaluated 103 abstracts.  Each ab-
stract was assigned by each judge into one of three 
categories, based on the criteria given after the cat-
egory label:
       
1. Relevant: Both drugs from the question or 
their generic names are mentioned in the abstracts, 
the drugs are directly compared to each other and 
the disease or the attribute with respect to which 
they are being compared is also mentioned and the 
158
same as stated in the question or synonymous to it 
(e.g. heartburn and dyspepsia would both count as 
right because they are closely related).
2.  Not  Relevant: The  drugs  or  their  generic 
names are not mentioned in the abstract, the drugs 
are not compared and/or the disease or the attribute 
with respect to which they are being compared is 
wrong (as in different  from what is stated in the 
question,  e.g.  effect  on blood pressure instead of 
use as a painkiller).
3.  Somewhat  Relevant: The  drugs  or  their 
generic names are mentioned but there are no sin-
gle  sentences  indicating  a  comparison  between 
them or the disease is not mentioned. If the wrong 
disease is mentioned, the abstract should be labeled 
?not relevant?.
The judges were also asked to explain the rea-
son for their choice of labels.                                 
The  inter-annotator  agreement  between  the 
judges was computed using a variant kappa statis-
tic for multiple annotators (Fleiss, 1971). The null 
hypothesis was rejected and it was ensured that the 
observed agreement is not accidental. 
Overall  inter-annotator agreement  for all  three 
categories  measured  by  the  kappa  statistic  was 
moderate at 0.58 for a total of 103 judgments. 47 
judgments were in the ?somewhat relevant? cate-
gory.  If  annotator  agreement  is  only  assessed on 
the  remaining  56  judgments  from  the  two  cate-
gories ?relevant? and ?not relevant?, kappa is 0.97, 
which represents almost perfect agreement. 
6 Results and Discussion                    
Graph  1  shows  the  percentage  of  abstracts  that 
were judged relevant by the eight judges for each 
question.  The  numbers  of  retrieved  abstracts  for 
each question were: 15 abstracts for Question 1, 5, 
8 and 10, 9 abstracts for question 7 and 11, 7 ab-
stracts for Question 2, 5 abstracts for Question 9, 4 
abstracts  for  Question  6  and  12,  3  abstracts  for 
Question 3 and 2 abstracts for Question 4.
Question 1, 9 and 12 show a very high percent-
age of relevant abstracts (73%, 80% and 100%  re-
spectively), whereas no relevant abstracts were re-
trieved for questions 4, 5 and 11, and only one rel-
evant abstract (out of 15) for question 10. An ab-
stract was considered relevant when at least five of 
the eight judges considered it relevant.

The label on the top of each bar is the actual percentage. 
Here the main sources for these disparate results 
are discussed, based on both the explanations given 
by  the  student  judges  and  discussions  with  our

Approximately 30% (31 of 103) of the abstracts 
were labeled ?not relevant? by the judges because 
they  lacked any direct  evidence of a comparison 
e.g. at least one sentence that explicitly compares 
the two drugs in question, even though the drugs 
are  mentioned  in  the  abstract  and  the  study is  a 
comparative study (as  indicated  in  its  MeSH in-
dices).  This  is  illustrated  in  Example  (9),  which 
shows the three sentences from one of the abstracts 
retrieved for Question 1 that explicitly mention the 
two drugs:
(9) Piretanide and furosemide have a constant 
extrarenal elimination and thus accumulate in  
renal failure.[...] Elimination of torasemide is 
independent of its renal excretion. Thus in renal 
failure, torasemide is the only loop diuretic in 
which the plasma concentration is strictly dose 
dependent.

 About 10% (10) of the abstracts were judged to 
be irrelevant because the drugs were compared as 
part of a treatment regime in combination with oth-
er drugs, as in Abstract 4 for Question 6 in which 
calcium  citrate  and  calcium  carbonate  are  com-
pared co-administered  with different  preparations 
of  sodium fluoride.  In two cases  (2% of  the  ab-
stracts),  doses  of  a  given  drug  were  compared 
against  other  dosages  instead  of  the  drugs them-
selves,  e.g.  30  mg lansoprazole  versus  20mg 
omeprazole.                         
A major factor for ?not relevant? judgments was 
the time frame. This was relevant when retrieving 
abstracts  about  well-established  drugs  that  have 
been in existence for a long time, such as ibuprofen 
or  diclofenac. All but one of the 18 abstracts re-
trieved for the two questions about these two drugs 
were irrelevant,  even though the two drugs were 
explicitly mentioned in the abstract.  The problem 
is that they were grouped together as conventional 
non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs) 
and compared to newer NSAIDs or different pain 
medication. Such abstracts could only be excluded 
by analyzing the abstracts themselves. Whether to 
proceed systematically back through the abstracts 
ordered by recency, or to retrieve abstracts from a 
random time interval, or from a window of  n-years 
after the drug came on the market, will be a matter 
to be assessed empirically.
The  final  source  of  ?non  relevant?  judgments 
was a problem with the judges and not with the ab-
stracts. In Question 2 regarding dyspepsia,  two out 
of seven abstracts were judged irrelevant because 
the drugs were not explicitly compared regarding 
dyspepsia but  only regarding H. pylori,  which is 
one of the possible causes for dyspepsia. Also ab-
stracts retrieved for Question 7 about the effect on 
lipid profiles were wrongly categorised by roughly 
a third of the judges as not being relevant to the 
liver.                                    
 The experiment has shown that searching for the 
drugs, the basis of the comparison and studies of 
the  publication  type  comparative  study  is  a  first 
step towards retrieving abstracts that can serve as 
answer  candidates  for  clinical  comparison  ques-
tions, but it has been shown not to be sufficient to 
guarantee the relevance of the retrieved abstracts.  
The two main problems discovered during the 
experiment  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  further 
processing steps for the retrieved abstracts concern 
abstracts lacking sentences in which the drugs are 
directly compared to each other and the retrieval of 
irrelevant  abstracts  for  well-established  drugs, 
which are used as a reference for comparing newer 
drugs to, instead of containing direct comparisons 
of the drugs in question. 
7 Conclusion and Future Work                  
This work introduced the task of answering clinical 
comparison questions  and pointed  out  challenges 
in recognising and extracting their components. It 
also described strategies for retrieving MEDLINE? 
abstracts  and  showed  that  only  looking  for  the 
compared  entities  without  including  the  basis  of 
the comparison is not enough to retrieve useful ab-
stracts.  
The initial experiment evaluating the relevance 
of retrieved abstracts for twelve clinical compari-
son  questions revealed a number of problems that 
need to be taken into account for future work, es-
pecially  the lack of sentences  containing  explicit 
comparisons  and  dealing  with  well-established 
drugs.
During the next stages, the process of identify-
ing  and  extracting  the  elements  of  a  comparison 
question as well as the process of retrieving  MED-
LINE? abstracts will be automated using tools from 
the UMLS Knowledge Sources. Features or rules 
will be defined to augment SemRep to deal with 
the  problems  concerning  non-scalar comparisons 
and  structurally  different  scalar  comparison  dis-
cussed in Section 3.1 to be able to automatically 
extract the relevant comparison components. Also, 
possible solutions will be researched to automati-
cally overcome the problems of retrieving relevant 
abstracts  identified  and  discussed  in  Section  6.
