The paper specifically presents how linguistic (oral) and 
tactile references are dealt with in the GEORAL sys- 
tem which has already been described in other papers. 
In this system, users can formulate their queries and 
provide their responses using the oral (linguistic) mo- 
dality and the tactile modality separately or together. 
We describe the referential phenomena which occur in 
such a context and we point out why the oral modality 
has to be the basis of the processing of the references 
and why robustness problems have to be dealt with. 
We then provide details about the three steps of the 
reference processing (linguistic analysis, processing of 
the tactile events and merging process) as well as the 
modeling of the communicative acts used in the system 
(as planning operators). 
Introduction 
Adding a new modality in an existing oral dialogue sys- 
tem poses many interesting problems. Among these, 
those which concern the referential phenomena deserve 
to be quoted. How do the users designate the referents? 
If several modalities are used, how can we model the 
various activities on each modality? How to exploit 
them? how to deal with the performance problem (ro- 
bustness)?... All these questions arise, but not all have 
complete answers despite numerous work done in the 
domain \[2, 12\]. 
In order to eliminate some drawbacks of speech reco- 
gnition, we have added a touch screen to an oral system 
\[7\]. Thus users can formulate their queries and provide 
their responses using the oral (linguistic) modality and 
the tactile modality separately or together. This paper 
presents responses to some of the questions above. First 
we describe the system the goal of which is the querying 
of a geographic and tourist database. Then we ana- 
lyse the referential phenomena both from the linguistic 
and the tactile point of view. This analysis is origi- 
nated from an experimental (WOZ) work \[11\] and the 
results have been confirmed by way of a first evaluation 
of the system with naive users. The different ypes of 
problems are underlined. The paper continues by pre- 
senting the general principles which guide us and the 
description of the principal processing methods. The 
principles are concerned with the choice of the moda- 
lity on which the resolution of references i  based, the 
architecture of the steps and the type of modeling. In 
the course of the description of the processing methods, 
we provide details about the format and the content 
of the data used. In the conclusion, we outline future 
planned studies using the system. More details about 
the preliminary experiments, the architecture and the 
system evaluation can be found in \[11, 18, 19\]. 
Sys tem descr ip t ion  
GEORAL Tactile is a multimodal system which is able 
to provide information of a touristic nature to naive 
users. Users can ask for information about he location 
of places of interest (city, beach, chateau, church,...) wi- 
thin a region or a subregion, or distance and itinerary 
between two localities. Users interact with the system 
using three different modalities: in a visual mode by 
looking to the map displayed on the screen, in an oral 
and natural anguage mode (thanks to a speech reco- 
gnition board 1) and in a gesture mode pointing to or 
drawing on a touch screen. The system itself uses both 
the oral channel (text-to-speech synthesis) and graphics

such as the flashing of sites, routes and zooming in on 
subsections of the map, so as to best inform the user. 
The dialogue model is an adaptation of the LOKI 
model \[22\]. It allows to build up a structured ialogue 
history based on the theme of the queries. Some dia- 
logue functionalities (spelling, repeating, writing) are 
added in order to take into account specific features of 
the oral mode. The model also contains co-operative al- 
gorithms \[9, 10\] which avoid producing empty responses 
and allow to manage the interaction in a directed but 
friendly manner. 
Re ferent ia l  phenomena 
In such a context, we implemented a WOZ experiment 
\[11\] in order to study how users designate the referents. 
The main outcomes of this study have been confirmed 
during a first evaluation of the system \[19\]. We examine 
here primarily the deictic problems concerning both the 
tactile and linguistic users' activities. Most standard 
anaphora re dealt with in the system (using lexical, 
syntactic and semantic information). This, however, is 
not discussed here. 
What  are the referents? 
In this application, the possible referents are sites ~ and 
localities which are recorded in the database and which 
may appear on the displayed map. From a user point 
of view, and depending on the state of the dialogue, a 
possible referent may be displayed on the screen (for 
example at the beginning of the dialogue, the main lo- 
calities are presented on the map; after a suggestive res- 
ponse of the system, a few interesting localities are pre- 
sented on the map with a flashing effect possibly after 
zooming in) or may only be evoked when, for example 
a user would like to know if a certain site not displayed 
on the screen exists in a zone of the map. 
How do  users  designate? 
Var ious  types  o f  tactile activities Two main types 
of tactile activities are observed: 
? the pointing mode: the user points out a point on 
the screen which may correspond to a referent (site, 
locality) or to a place for which there is no referent. 
? the zoning mode: the user drawns up a zone in which 
the user want to do a search for referents. The dra- 
wing of the zone may be quite complex: it can use 
some elements of the map (coast, river,...), the surface 
can be open or closed... In the current implementa- 
tion, only the closed zones are dealt with. 
2In our system, site is a place of interest (eg. a church), 
locality is a place name and zone is a region delimited by 
the system or the user. 
Tactile and Linguistic joint activities The pre- 
sence of the tactile screen modifies the linguistic beha- 
viour of the user: some particular deictic terms (around 
10 words and expressions are dealt with) and particular 
syntactic structures appear. Three possible relation- 
ships between oral utterances and tactile gestures have 
been identified (the two main ones follow): 
? bound relationship in which one deictic item appea- 
ring in the oral utterance and a touch activity are 
used together to designate a referent (or a set of re- 
ferents) on the map3: 
(1) U: Are there any beaches in this locality? + a 
touch on a locality. 
(2) U: Are there any chateaux here? + a touch on a 
locality. 
(3) U: Are there any churches in this zone? + dra- 
wing a zone on the map. 
(4) U: Here + a touch on a locality. 
(5) U: This one + a touch on a site. 
confirmative relationship for which the oral syntagm 
is sufficient enough to comprehend but is however ac- 
companied by a tactile designation, which is redun- 
dant with the linguistic reference: 
(6) U: Are there any beaches in Lannion? + a touch 
on Lannion. 
(7) U: in Lannion + a touch on Lannion. 
Some diff icult ies 
These designation modes seem to be very straightfor- 
ward and easy to deal with but some problems which 
depend on the user behaviour arise and make proces- 
sing more complicated. 
The relationship between the deictic term and the tac- 
tile designation is not systematic. For example, one can 
find an utterance (2) occuring together with a drawing 
of a zone (in French pointing would better correspond 
to the item here), or second example, utterance (3) can 
also merely come with a pointing which is not sugges- 
ted by the syntagm in this zone. From another point 
of view, the user tactile activities may be imprecise, for 
example the pointing together with utterance (1) could 
designate a place where there is no locality. These pro- 
blems suggest o design mechanisms which will have to 
deal with these imprecisions in a static and dynamic 
way. 
Experiments have also displayed differences between 
users concerning the use of the tactile screen. The de- 
gree of use of the tactile is highly dependant of the sub- 
jects: on average 36% of the initial requests are com- 
posed of a tactile activity but the highest rate for any

mean that oral modality has to keep a dominating role 
as far the reference processing is concerned.

Processing the references 
Main principles 
Some main principles can characterize our approach of 
the problem; they reflect two major concerns: the first 
one is the robustness in order to deal with the impreci- 
sion and the second one is the flexibility in order to tune 
out the behaviour of the system and to make easier its 
evolution. These principles are as follows: 
? The global processing is divided up in three sequen- 
tial steps: a linguistic analysis, a tactile analysis and 
a merging process. 
? The processing is mainly based on the oral moda- 
lity, i.e. on the analysis (syntactic and thematic) 
of the oral utterance. This fact not only allows us 
to take into account he different uses of the system 
(with or without he tactile screen), but also compels 
us to do so because the tactile mode does not pro- 
vide sufficient information in most of the cases. This 
choice presents ome consequences and drawbacks: 
the speech recognition becomes very important and 
the discrepancies between oral and tactile activities 
will be dealt with by the tactile analysis. 
? The algorithms are based on contextual information. 
The dialogue history (context) provides the necessary 
elements (referents) to progressively solve the refe- 
rences, and the oral utterance (co-text) provides pre- 
dictions about foreseen referents and type of tactile 
activity. Nevertheless, we chose an approach where 
the results of the linguistic and tactile activities are 
merged instead of an approach where the activities 
are interpreted using the tactile context \[20\]. 
? Finally, the modelling of the different activities is ba- 
sed on planning operators which allow us to easily 
build up communicative acts that represent the joint 
activities of the user. 
Main Processes 
Linguistic Analysis This analysis is made up of two 
modules: the syntactical and the  thematic analysis 
which are triggered after the speech recognition. The 
syntactic analysis produces a complete syntactic tree 
using the difference list method \[6\]. The deictic and 
anaphoric syntagms are only spotted in the utterance 
and coded inside the tree. The thematic analysis has 
two principal roles as regards the tactile function. It 
determines the possible types (style) of tactile touch 
(point, zone) as well as the theme of the question (type 
of object in question). It also produces an intermediary 
structure, a so-called dialogue act, of which the mo- 
deling of propositional content is inspired by \[1\]. For 
example, the user's utterance: 
ASK(U, S, informref(S, U, beach, Q(beach, 
locality(deicphore(pointing))))) 
where deicphore(pointing) is generated by the presence 
of the keyword here and indicates a user tactile activity 
to point out the place where the system will have to 
explore. The transmission of the theme to the tactile 
processor is accompanied by the relevant objects of the 
database. 
Processing the tactile activities The aim of this 
processing is, starting from the elementary events which 
correspond to tactile activity of the user, to provide the 
possible objects of the database which correspond to the 
designated or desired referents. The process is based on 
a prediction about the style transmitted by the thema- 
tic analyser as well as on objects (potential referents) 
pre-selected from the database. It produces a possible 
empty list (tactile acts) of designated objects. 
At this level the robustness problems are two-fold: 
(1) the gestural activity may consist of several gestures 
(drawing multiple zones, touching multiple locations), 
(2) the gestural activity may not be consistent with the 
linguistic activity. As far as the first type is concerned, 
we only take into account he two final points or the last 
drawn zone. As for the second type, we have designed 
a small set of rules (easily modifiable), which allows us 
to modify the gestural activity observed according to 
the expected style. Up to now, this modification does 
not take into account neither the geographical context 
nor the dialogic one. 
Producing Communicative Acts A communica- 
tive act (CA) expresses the user's intention, which in 
turn is simultaneously conveyed by the speech activity 
(the dialogue act) and the tactile activity. In order 
to determine a CA one must merge the two types of 
activity, whilst using to a maximum advantage the re- 
dundant information conveyed by the two media \[4, 20\]. 
This merging must also take into account possible inco- 
herence problems between media, as a result either of 
the system (speech recognition and understanding) or
of the user. According to the dialogue context, (reco- 
gnized type of dialogue act) the merging is carried out 
in two ways. A set of rules, taking into account he dif- 
ferent situations on the media, is used for dealing with 
phatic dialogue acts, as it is for a closed question. They 
enable a decision to be taken. The following rule (sim- 
plified): 
identification(L2) :-speech (L1),tactile(L2). 
specifies that the location designated by the user will 
be L2 because it was designated in a tactile fashion des- 
pite the fact that speech recognition provided L1. The 
expertise currently coded in the rules is the outcome 
of the WOZ corpus; it has a tendency to favor tactile

Figure 1: A model for the Request Communicative Act 
media. The specification by means of rules will make 
future modifications easier. 
The second mode of merging concerns the dialogue 
acts labelled as requests. It is based on a representation 
of CA as plan operators \[5, 15, 16, 21\]. Dialogue acts 
as well as the tactile acts are considered as low level 
plan operators. Whilst merging, we solve tactile and 
linguistic o-references \[3, 8\]. 
For example, Figure 1 shows a model of the CA RE- 
QUEST for the completive mode where a tactile event 
and a dialogue act have to be merged. This case is spe- 
cified by the presence of the tactile act "D~signer" in 
the Body part of the model. 
The predicate D~ictique in the precondition part 
checks the consistency beetween the deictic term 
(?P(?D)) within the dialogue act ASK and the referent 
(%) provided by the tactile act. It produces the referent 
(?P'(?o')) to be placed in the communicative act. For 
example, the deictic term locality (deicphore(pointing)) 
in the dialogue act: 
ASK(U, S, informref(S, U, beach, Q(beach, loca- 
lity(deicphore(pointing))))) 
and the referent (Lannion. pointing, 1, X, Y) in the tac- 
tile act 
D~signer(U, S, (Lannion, pointing, 1, X, Y)) 
will be recognized as compatible and allow to produce 
the referent locality(Lannion) for the CA REQUEST: 
Request(U, S, informref(S, U, beach, Q(beach, loca- 
lity(Lannion)))) 
Further details are provided in \[17\]. We can also ob- 
serve the considerable flexibility brought about by the 
use of rules in the verification of preconditions. 
D iscuss ion  and  Future  Plans 
We described the methods and models we designed in 
order to take into account deictic references within a 
specific framework. These solutions are mainly based 
on contextual information. They allow to deal with 
some robustness problems and to provide a certain flexi- 
bility for specifying the operations in order to take into 
account future new semantic or pragmatic information. 
Clearly, the solutions we have presented in this frame- 
work are strongly dependent on the kind of application 
targeted. For example, an application in which users 
handle objects using the system presents other charac- 
teristics and so will need other solutions. 
We plan to extend this work in several directions: 
? to take into account other styles of designations and 
tactile activities. For example, to allow activities 
such as: 
U: Are there any beaches along this coast? + U fol- 
lows with his finger a coast 
or  
U: Are there any chateaux above this river? + U 
touches on a river. 
These possibilities need to add a lot of new item to 
the speech recognition vocabulary but in addition re- 
quire new knowledge about he cartographic context. 
It will be also necessary to pay closer attention to 
user behaviour and perhaps even contemplate user 
modelling. 
? to allow the user to ask about typical features of cer- 
tain referents (for example: opening hours of a site). 
In this case, clearly the nature of the referential phe- 
nomena will change and will need some more sophis- 
ticated processing \[14\].
