Abstract
This paper presents an analysis of how the
level of performance achievable by an NLU
module can affect the optimal modular design
of a dialogue system. We present an evalua-
tion that shows how NLU accuracy levels im-
pact the overall performance of a system that
includes an NLU module and a rule-based di-
alogue policy. We contrast these performance
levels with the performance of a direct classifi-
cation design that omits a separate NLU mod-
ule. We conclude with a discussion of the po-
tential for a hybrid architecture incorporating
the strengths of both approaches.
1 Introduction
Recently computer-driven conversational characters
or virtual humans have started finding real-life ap-
plications ranging from education to health services
and museums (Traum et al., 2005; Swartout et al.,
2006; Kenny et al., 2009; Jan et al., 2009; Swartout
et al., 2010). As proliferation of these systems in-
creases, there is a growing demand for the design
and construction of virtual humans to be made more
efficient and accessible to people without extensive
linguistics and computer science backgrounds, such
as writers, designers, and educators. We are specif-
ically interested in making the language processing
and dialogue management components in a virtual
human easier for such potential authors to develop.
Some system building steps that can be challenging
for such authors include annotating the meaning of
user and system utterances in a semantic formalism,
developing a formal representation of information
state, and writing detailed rules that govern dialogue
management.
We are generally interested in the extent to which
these various authoring steps are necessary in order
to achieve specific levels of system performance. In
this paper, we present a case study analysis of the
performance of two alternative architectures for a
specific virtual human. The two architectures, which
have been developed and evaluated in prior work
(DeVault et al., 2011b; DeVault et al., 2011a), differ
substantially in their semantic annotation and policy
authoring requirements. We describe these architec-
tures and our evaluation corpus in Section 2. We
focus our new analysis specifically on how the over-
all performance of one of the architectures, which
uses a natural language understanding (NLU) mod-
ule and hand-authored rules for the dialogue policy,
depends on the performance of the NLU module. In
Section 3, we describe our finding that, depending
on the attainable level of NLU accuracy, this modu-
lar approach may or may not perform better than a
simpler direct classification design that omits a sep-
arate NLU module and has a lower annotation and
rule authoring burden. In Section 4, we present an
initial exploration of whether a hybrid architecture
may be able to combine these approaches? strengths.
2 Summary of Data Set and Prior Results
This work is part of an ongoing research effort
into techniques for developing high quality dialogue
policies using a relatively small number of sample
dialogues and low annotation requirements (DeVault
et al., 2011b; DeVault et al., 2011a). This section
briefly summarizes our prior work and data set.
270
2.1 Data Set
For our experiments we use the dataset described
in (DeVault et al., 2011b). It contains 19 Wiz-
ard of Oz dialogues with a virtual human called
Amani (Gandhe et al., 2009). The user plays the
role of an Army commander whose unit has been at-
tacked by a sniper. The user interviews Amani, who
was a witness to the incident and has some informa-
tion about the sniper. Amani is willing to tell the
interviewer what she knows, but she will only re-
veal certain information in exchange for promises of
safety, secrecy, and money (Artstein et al., 2009).
Each dialogue turn in the data set includes a single
user utterance followed by the response chosen by a
human Amani role player. There are a total of 296
turns, for an average of 15.6 turns/dialogue. User
utterances are modeled using 46 distinct speech act
(SA) labels. The dataset also defines a different set
of 96 unique SAs (responses) for Amani. Six ex-
ternal referees analyzed each user utterance and se-
lected a single character response out of the 96 SAs.
Thus the dataset defines a one-to-many mapping be-
tween user utterances and alternative system SAs.
2.2 Evaluation Metric
We evaluate the dialogue policies in our experi-
ments through 19-fold cross-validation of our 19 di-
alogues. In each fold, we hold out one dialogue and
use the remaining 18 as training data. To measure
policy performance, we count an automatically pro-
duced system SA as correct if that SA was chosen by
the original wizard or at least one external referee for
that dialogue turn. We then count the proportion of
the correct SAs among all the SAs produced across
all 19 dialogues, and use this measure of weak accu-
racy to score dialogue policies.
We can use the weak accuracy of one referee,
measured against all the others, to establish a per-
formance ceiling for this metric. This score is .79;
see DeVault et al. (2011b).
2.3 Baseline Systems
We consider two existing baseline systems in our ex-
periments here. The first system (Rules-NLU-SA)
consists of a statistical NLU module that maps a user
utterance to a single user SA label, and a rule-based
dialogue policy hand-crafted by one of the authors.
The NLU uses a maximum-entropy model (Berger
et al., 1996) to classify utterances as one of the user
SAs using shallow text features. Training this model
requires a corpus of user utterances that have been
semantically annotated with the appropriate SA.
We developed our rule-based policy by manu-
ally writing the simple rules needed to implement
Amani?s dialogue policy. Given a user SA label
At for turn t, the rules for determining Amani?s re-
sponse Rt take one of three forms:
(a)ifAt = SAi thenRt = SAj
(b)ifAt = SAi ? ?kAt?k = SAl thenRt = SAj
(c)ifAt = SAi ? ??kAt?k = SAl thenRt = SAj
The first rule form specifies that a given user SA
should always lead to a given system response. The
second and third rule forms enable the system?s re-
sponse to depend on the user having previously per-
formed (or not performed) a specific SA. One the
system developers, who is also a computational lin-
guist, created the current set of 42 rules in about 2
hours. There are 30 rules of form (a), 6 rules of form
(b), and 6 rules of form (c).
The second baseline system (RM-Text) is a sta-
tistical classifier that selects system SAs by analyz-
ing shallow features of the user utterances and sys-
tem responses. We use the Relevance Model (RM)
approach pioneered by Lavrenko et al. (2002) for
cross-lingual information retrieval and adapted to
question-answering by Leuski et al. (2006). This
method does not require semantic annotation or rule
authoring; instead, the necessary training data is de-
fined by linking user utterances directly to the appro-
priate system responses (Leuski and Traum, 2010).
Table 1 summarizes the performance for the base-
line systems (DeVault et al., 2011a). The NLU mod-
ule accuracy is approximately 53%, and the weak
accuracy of .58 for the corresponding system (Rules-
NLU-SA) is relatively low when compared to the
RM system at .71. For comparison we provide a
third data point: for Rules-G-SA, we assume that
our NLU is 100% accurate and always returns the
correct (?gold?) SA label. We then run the rule-
based dialogue policy on those labels. The third
column (Rules-G-SA) shows the resulting weak ac-
curacy value, .79, which is comparable to the weak
accuracy score achieved by the human referees (De-
Vault et al., 2011b).

3 NLU Accuracy and System Performance
We conducted two experiments. In the first, we stud-
ied the effect of NLU accuracy on the performance
of the Rules-NLU-SA system. One of our goals was
to find how accurate the NLU would have to be for
the Rules-NLU-SA system to outperform RM-Text.
To investigate this, we simulated NLU perfor-
mance at different accuracy levels by repeatedly
sampling to create a mixture of the SAs from the
trained NLU classifier and from the correct (gold)
set of SAs. Specifically, we set a fixed value p rang-
ing from 0 to 1 and then iterate over all dialogue
turns in the held out dialogue, selecting the the cor-
rect SA label with probability p or the trained NLU
module?s output with probability 1 ? p. Using the
sampled set of SA labels, we compute the result-
ing simulated NLU accuracy, run the Rules dialogue
policy, and record the weak accuracy result. We re-
peat the process 25 times for each value of p. We let
p range from 0 to 1 in increments of .05 to explore a
range of simulated accuracy levels.
Figure 1 shows simulated NLU accuracy and the
corresponding dialogue policy weak accuracy as a
point in two dimensions. The points form a cloud
with a clear linear trend that starts at approximately
53% NLU accuracy where it intersects with the
Rules-NLU-SA system performance and then goes
up to the Rules-G performance at 100% NLU accu-
racy. The correlation is strong with R2 = 0.97.1
The existence of a mostly linear relationship com-
ports with the fact that most of the policy rules (30
of 42), as described in Section 2.3, are of form (a).
For such rules, each individual correct NLU speech
act translates directly into a single correct system
response, with no dependence on the system hav-
ing understood previous user utterances correctly.
In contrast, selecting system responses that comply
with rules in forms (b) and (c) generally requires
correct understanding of multiple user utterances.
Such rules create a nonlinear relationship between
policy performance and NLU accuracy, but these
rules are relatively few in number for Amani.
The estimated linear trend line (in purple) crosses
the RM-Text system performance at approximately
82% NLU accuracy. This result suggests that our
NLU component would need to improve from its
current accuracy of 53% to approximately 82% ac-
curacy for the Rules-NLU-SA system to outperform
the RM-Text classifier. This represents a very sub-
stantial increase in NLU accuracy that, in practice,
could be expected to require a significant effort in-
volving utterance data collection, semantic annota-
tion, and optimization of machine learning for NLU.
4 Hybrid System
In our second experiment we investigated the po-
tential to integrate the Rules-NLU-SA and RM-Text
systems together for better performance. Our ap-
proach draws on a confidence score ? from the NLU
maximum-entropy classifier; specifically, ? is the
probability assigned to the most probable user SA.
Figure 2 shows an analysis of NLU accuracy,
Rules-NLU-SA, and RM-Text that is restricted to
those subsets of utterances for which NLU confi-
dence ? is greater than or equal to some threshold ? .
Two important aspects of this figure are (1) that rais-
ing the minimum confidence threshold also raises
the NLU accuracy on the selected subset of utter-
ances; and (2) that there is a threshold NLU confi-
dence level beyond which Rules-NLU-SA seems to
1This type of analysis of dialogue system performance in
terms of internal component metrics is somewhat similar to the
regression analysis in the PARADISE framework (Walker et al.,
2000). However, here we are not concerned with user satis-
faction, but are instead focused solely on the modular system?s
ability to reproduce a specific well-defined dialogue policy.

outperform RM-Text. This confidence level is ap-
proximately 0.95, and it identifies a subset of user
utterances for which NLU accuracy is 83.3%. These
results therefore suggest that NLU confidence can
be useful in identifying utterances for which NLU
speech acts are more likely to be accurate and Rules-
NLU-SA is more likely to perform well.
To explore this further, we implemented a hy-
brid system that chooses between Rules-NLU-SA or
RM-Text as follows. If the confidence score is high
enough (? ? ? , for some fixed threshold ? ), the Hy-
brid system uses the NLU output to run the Rules
dialogue policy to select the system SA; otherwise,
it discards the NLU SA, and applies the RM classi-
fier to select the system response directly.
Figure 3 shows the plot of the Hybrid system per-
formance as a function of the threshold value ? .
We see that with sufficiently high threshold value
(? ? 0.95) the Hybrid system outperforms both
the Rules-NLU-SA and the RM-Text systems. The
second line, labeled ?Mix? and plotted against the
secondary (right) axis, shows the proportion of the
NLU SAs with the confidence score that exceed the
threshold (? ? ? ). It indicates how often the Hybrid
system prefers the Rules-NLU-SA output over the
RM-Text system output. We observe that approxi-
mately 42 of the NLU outputs over all 296 dialogue
turns (15%) have confidence values ? ? 0.95. How-
ever, for most of these dialogue turns the outputs for
the Rules-NLU-SA and RM-Text dialogue policies
are the same. While we observe a small improve-
ment in the Hybrid system weak accuracy values
over the RM-Text system at thresholds of 0.95 and
higher, the difference is not statistically significant.
Despite the lack of statistical significance in the
initial Hybrid results in this small data set, we inter-
pret the complementary evidence from both experi-
ments, which support the potential for Rules-NLU-
SA to perform well when NLU accuracy is high, and
the potential for a hybrid system to identify a subset
of utterances that are likely to be understood accu-
rately at run-time, as indicating that a hybrid design
is a promising avenue for future work.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented a case study analysis of how the level
of performance that is achievable in an NLU module
can provide perspective on the design choices for a
modular dialogue system. We found that NLU accu-
racy must be substantially higher than it currently is
in order for the Rules-NLU-SA design, which car-
ries a greater annotation and rule authoring burden,
to deliver better performance than the simpler RM-
Text design. We also presented evidence that a hy-
brid architecture could be a promising direction.
