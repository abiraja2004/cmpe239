1. Introduction 
One of the main problems for applied natural anguage processing is gaps in the 
lexicon, including missing words and word senses, and inadequate descriptions of 
word use in context. Traditional lexicography has similar concerns. The availability of 
large, on-line text corpora provides a straightforward tool for enlarging the stock of 
words included in a lexicon. The identification of additional word senses and uses is 
more problematic, however. 
Much recent lexicographic work employs concordances generated from text cor- 
pora for these purposes. While this approach provides a more solid empirical basis 
than traditional lexicographic approaches (which depend on the manual collection and 
sorting of citation index cards), concordances can actually provide too much data. For 
example, a concordance for the word certain produced on an 11.6 million-word sub- 
sample of the Longman/Lancaster Corpus generated 3,424 entries; a concordance for 
the word right from the same subcorpus generated 7,619 entries. Simply determining 
the number of different senses in a database of this size is a daunting task; to accu- 
rately group different uses or rank them in order of importance is not really feasible 
without the use of additional tools. 
One such tool is to simply sort concordance lines according to their different 
collocational patterns. Entries can be sorted according to their collocates on both the left 
and the right. Many of these collocational pairs show a strong relation to a particular 
word sense (e.g., contrast right ear and right away), and thus analysis of collocational 
relations has become an important tool for lexical knowledge acquisition (see Sinclair 
1991; Smadja 1991; Zernik 1991). 
In addition, there are statistical tools that can help determine the relative strength 
of collocational relations. For example, Church and Hanks (1990) describe the use of the 
mutual information index for this purpose (cf. Calzolari and Bindi 1990). Church et al 
(1991) further describe the use of t-scores to assess the extent of the differences between 
the collocational patterns of nearly synonymous words. These tools are important in 
that the strongest collocational ssociations often represent different word senses, and 
thus 'they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs 
to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags' (Church and Hanks 1990, p. 28). 
However, such tools do not directly characterize word senses or even provide any 
direct indication of the number of different senses that a word has. 1 Further, these

tools are not designed to assess the relations among various collocations, addressing 
the question of which clusters of collocations reflect similar underlying senses. 2 
The present paper discusses the use of factor analysis (a multivariate statistical 
technique) as a tool for such research questions. In particular, this technique con- 
tributes three types of information ot provided by other complementary techniques: 
1) an indication of the number of major senses and/or uses associated with a word; 
2) an indication of the way that various collocational patterns relate to one another 
in marking word senses and uses; and 3) a fuller analysis of the senses themselves, 
based on interpretation of the shared bases underlying the groupings of collocations. 
2. Methodology 
The use of multivariate statistical techniques for lexical knowledge acquisition was 
first proposed by Bindi et al (1991). In particular, that study illustrates the use of 
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to identify the relations among semantically related 
word types (e.g., piccolo, corto, breve) and their collocates (or 'word mates'). The input 
data for this approach are mutual information indexes computed over the domain of 
an entire corpus. Separate association indexes are computed for each pair of target 
word types (e.g., piccolo and corto) and for all of the word types in relation to various 
'word-mates' (e.g., piccolo with bambino). This entire matrix is then analyzed by MDS to 
cluster word types and word-mates along a few underlying dimensions, providing a 
geometric representation f the semantic domain in question (in this case, 'smallness'). 
Word types are clustered together to the extent hat they are associated with the same 
word-mates. The geometric distance between a word-mate and its word type reflects 
the strength of the relevant association index, and word-mates are clustered together 
to the extent hat they are associated with the same word types (see Bindi et al 1991). 
Factor analysis differs from MDS in that the input data are computed over the 
domain of individual texts, rather than over the domain of the entire corpus. Fur- 
ther, the application of factor analysis here is to identify basic word senses and uses 
associated with a single word rather than the relations among a set of semantically 
related words. This statistical technique identifies the groupings of collocations that 
tend to co-occur frequently in texts. If we assume that texts are topically coherent, 
it follows that groupings of collocations that co-occur frequently in texts will often 
reflect different underlying word senses. 
This approach is illustrated here through analyses of two words--certain and 
right--in an 11.66 million-word subsample of the Longman/Lancaster corpus. This 
corpus is designed to represent a wide range of text varieties (see Summers 1991), 
including ten major topical categories (e.g., natural science, social science, fiction), 
three mediums (books, periodicals, and ephemera), and three levels (technical/literary, 
lay/middle, and popular). 
The first step in the analysis is to identify the major collocational patterns for the 
target word. In the present analysis, this was done simply by computing the frequency 
of all collocational pairs over the entire corpus; collocations that occurred more than 
30 times were considered to be important word associations and thus included in the 
subsequent analyses. 3 For certain, 20 left collocates and 14 right collocates met this 
2 Church et al (1991, pp. 150-155) show how word association measures computed over the domain of 
discourse units (rather than bigrams or SVO triples) can be used to identify topical domains for 
information retrieval purposes. 
3 There are more sophisticated approaches that could be used to identify the major collocational 
associations. First, mutual information indexes could be computed to identify strong word associations

criterion; for right, there were 24 left col locates and  53 r ight  col locates meet ing  the 
criterion. 
The next step was  to count  the f requency of each col locat ion pa i r  in each text 
of the corpus.  On ly  texts longer  than 20,000 words  were  inc luded at this stage, to 
insure adequate  representat ion  of the re levant  co-occurr ing col locations. Two hundred  
forty-s ix texts f rom the subcorpus  met  this condit ion.  
Factor  analys is  was then used to ident i fy  the group ings  of col locat ional  pairs  
that tended to co-occur in texts. Factor  analys is  bu i lds  upon pa i rw ise  correlat ions 
among the var iables to ident i fy  a reduced set of under ly ing  constructs,  or  ' factors' .  4 
Each var iable  has some correlat ion,  or  ' loading, '  w i th  each factor, but  on ly  the larger 
load ings  are impor tant  in interpret ing the under ly ing  constructs.  
In the present  case, the var iab les  are the f requency counts for each col locat ional  
pair. The factors thus represent  the col locat ional  pa i rs  that tend to co-occur f requent ly  
in texts. G iven  the fo l lowing assumpt ions ,  it was hypothes ized  that the factor group-  
ings of col locat ional  pairs  wou ld  represent  di f ferent under ly ing  word  senses; the re- 
qu i red assumpt ions  are: 1) that each col locat ional  pa i r  tends to have a st rong relat ion 
to a s ingle word  sense, and 2) that texts are topical ly  coherent,  and that words  wi l l  
therefore tend to be used in a single sense throughout  he domain  of a text. To the 
extent that these assumpt ions  are accurate,  col locat ional  pairs  shou ld  co-occur in texts 
as ref lect ions of the same under ly ing  word  sense. The pi lot  analyses  presented  in 
the fo l lowing sect ion indicate that these assumpt ions  do commonly  ho ld  in natura l  
d iscourse.  
3. Co-occurrence Patterns among Col locat ions for certain and right 
The factor analyses  for the col locates of certain and right are summar ized  in Tables 1 
and 2 respectively.  5 The tables present  he factor load ings  for each col locat ional  pair  
on each factor. Load ings  can range f rom 0.0 to p lus  or minus  1.0. A load ing  of 0.0 
that are not necessarily frequent in their overall occurrence. In addition, word associations ata distance 
should be included. 
4 See Biber (1988) for a fuller discussion of factor analysis and its application to the computational 
analysis of linguistic variation. There are three main corpus design considerations required by this use 
of factor analysis. First, the analysis requires long, connected texts, to provide ample opportunity for 
the (co-)occurrence of a range of collocational pairs; the analysis here excludes all texts shorter than 
20,000 words. Shorter texts would often contain few tokens of a few collocational pairs and would thus 
not adequately represent the correlations among collocations. Composite texts are not acceptable 
because they violate the assumption of topical coherence. Second, the analysis requires a large number 
of texts. A general rule of thumb for factor analysis is that there should be five times as many texts as 
variables (Gorsuch 1983). Thus, there should be a minimum of 240 texts included for the final factor 
analysis of right, which is based on 48 collocational pairs. (The final factor analysis of certain is based 
on 25 collocational pairs and would thus require only 150 texts.) The sub-corpus used here, with 246 
coherent texts longer than 20,000 words, meets these criteria. Finally, the corpus used for analysis must 
represent the full range of variability with respect to the collocational patterns. Corpora that are 
restricted topically or restricted to a few registers are not adequate for analyses of this type, because 
the reduced variability results in reduced correlations, which in turn result in a skewed and unreliable 
factorial structure (cf. Biber 1990). 
5 I used a common factor analysis with a Promax rotation. Scree plots of the eigenvalues and 
consideration f the two-, three-, and four-factor solutions indicated that the three-factor solution was 
the most adequate for the analysis of certain, while the four-factor solution was the most adequate for 
the analysis of right. Variables that had communalities K .10 were dropped from the final analysis; 25 
collocational pairs were included in the final analysis of certain, and 48 pairs in the analysis of right. 
In the analysis of certain, the first factor accounts for 21.4% of the shared variance, while the three 
factors together account for 39.4% of the shared variance. Factors 1 and 2 have a correlation of .30, 
while the other inter-factor correlations are negligible. In the analysis of right, the first factor accounts 
for 22.1% of the shared variance, while the four factors together account for 51.3% of the shared 
variance; the only appreciable inter-factor correlation is between Factors 2 and 3 (.43).

shows that the variable has no relation to the pool of shared variance accounted for 
by the factor, while a loading of 1.0 represents a perfect correlation. 
Each factor comprises a number  of collocational pairs with relatively large load- 
ings, while the remaining collocations have small or negligible associations. Tables 1 
and 2 are organized so that the collocations having large loadings on each of the factors 
are grouped together. 
Consider first the factorial structure for certain, presented in Table 1. The first 12 
collocations listed on the table have large loadings on Factor 1, with generally small 
loadings on the other two factors (e.g., in certain has a loading of .74 on Factor 1, but 
loadings near 0.0 on Factors 2 and 3). The second group of 7 collocations have the 
largest loadings on Factor 2; while the last group of 6 collocations have large loadings 
on Factor 3. 6 
For the purposes of interpretation, each factor can be considered as comprising 
6 The collocation for certain has a noteworthy loading of .41 on Factor 1 in addition to its loading of .44 
on Factor 2.

only those features with large loadings, so that each factor represents a separate group- 
ing of collocations that tend to co-occur frequently in texts. Factor 3 is the easiest o 
interpret: all six of the collocational pairs grouped on this factor represent contexts 
where certain functions to mark certainty. In all of these cases, certain is a predicative 
adjective, often taking a that complement clause (e.g., I am quite certain that... ). 
In contrast, certain does not have the sense of certainty in any of the collocational 
pairs grouped on Factors 1 and 2; rather the collocations grouped on these factors 
function to identify an unspecified (and perhaps unknown) subset of some larger 
group (e.g., in certain cases, a certain person). 7The difference between Factors 1 and 2 is 
less obvious. An examination of the concordance listings for the associated collocations, 
however, shows that there is an important, systematic difference between the two 
factors: the collocations on Factor 1 tend to modify concrete, physical or tangible 
referents, while the collocations on Factor 2 tend to modify abstract referents. Thus, 
consider the examples from both factors listed in Table 3. 
Factor I collocations tend to be more concrete, often characterizing physical objects 
(e.g., towns, adults, trees, raw vegetables). In contrast, Factor 2 collocations modify more 
abstract referents, such as basic truths, general values, and assumptions. The collocation 
for certain has a loading of about .40 on both Factor 1 and Factor 2, and it shows both 
kinds of pattern; for example, it modifies users and speakers, similar to other Factor 1 
collocations, and it modifies responsibilities, ymptoms, and deficiencies, similar to other 
Factor 2 collocations. 
The factorial structure for right, presented in Table 2, similarly shows a highly sys- 
tematic patterning among collocations. Factor I represents the positional or directional 
use of right; in fact, many of these collocations refer to body parts on the right side. 
Factor 2 is equally transparent but represents a word sense that does not receive 
much attention in most dictionaries: right marking 'immediately,' 'directly,' or 'exactly.' 
There are a large number of collocational pairs having this sense (e.g., right there, right 
back, right now), and Factor 2 shows that there is a strong tendency for these collocations 
to co-occur in texts. On first consideration, the collocation go~went right seems to be an 
exception to the general pattern underlying Factor 2 (representing the Factor 1 sense 
of 'to the right' instead). Examination of the concordance listings for this collocation 
shows, however, that it almost always occurs with the Factor 2 sense? as in go right 
through, go right up, he went right away. 
7 The collocational pair for certain does sometimes convey a sense of certainty, as in it isn't known for 
certain whether...

Factor 3 represents a grouping of collocations having the general sense of 'ok' 
or 'correct.' All right is commonly used to mark agreement or to mark a discourse 
juncture. Right can occur by itself with these same functions (hence the collocations 
of right with preceding and following punctuation). The collocation that's right also 
typically marks agreement to a previous assertion. Right then appears to represent a 
use of the Factor 2 pattern meaning 'immediately,' but this collocation also frequently 
occurs as a response in the context all right then. The collocation ot right indicates a
lack of correctness or normalcy, as in all was not right with the mirror and something was 
not right close-up. 
Finally, Factor 4 seems to represent a stylistically marked use of right at the end of 
a clause, with no intervening punctuation before the following clause. Collocations of 
this type commonly have all right, right, or that's right preceding a clause, as in all right 
you found the..., all right I pushed . . . .  that's right I think, right away they walk toward... The 
underpinnings of this factor need further investigation. 
4. Conc lus ion  
The two pilot analyses presented here indicate that this approach can be a useful tool 
for the semi-automatic identification ofunderlying word senses and uses. Further, both 
analyses produced unanticipated but systematic results, indicating that this approach 
can provide a useful complementary perspective totraditional lexicographic methods. 
These analyses could be extended in several ways. First, statistics uch as the 
mutual information i dex could be used to help identify the set of relevant collocations 
to be included in the factor analysis. Second, the corpus could be pre-processed by a 
537 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
grammatical tagger, making the collocations sensitive to grammatical category. Finally, 
lexical associations at a distance should be included in the analysis. In this regard, the 
analyses here have been restricted: they consider only collocations of adjacent words, 
with no regard for grammatical category, and with the input data identified simply on 
the basis of absolute frequency. However, even with these restrictions, factor analysis 
appears to be a powerful tool for identifying underlying patterns among collocations, 
reflecting some of the major senses and uses of a word.
