INITIAL FRICATIVES IN SOUTHERN BRITISH ~GLISH

I t  has  become apparent  to  some d ia lec to lo6 is ts  that  d i~ lecto l -  
ogy, particularly in its interpretive phase, is a branch of linguis- 
tics particularly adapted to the use of computers. The dialectol0- 
gist typically deals with large bodies of data, usually in the form 
of single words and short phrases, and he is interested in sorting 
and comparing individual items on many bases: phonological, morpho- 
logical, lexlcal, and geographical. The major obstacle that has 
prevented widespread use of computers in dialect study is the fact 
that the data for most of the great dialect surveys have been collec- 
I ted, recorded, and in most cases edited prior to the computer age. 
Thus the problem of preparing large bodies of data, much of it in 
narrow phonetic transcription, for computer use  has been formidable. 
One of the aims of the present paper is to show that results can be 
obtained relatively easily by computerized sorting and mapping that 
would take endless hours by traditional methods, and hopefully to 
encourage others to invest time and money in preparing data for the 
computer rather than in time-cc~suming hand sorting and map-making. 
Accordingly we sought a proble~ I that would be canplex enough to 
reveal the advantages of computerized dialectolo~y while at the same 
2 
t ime invo lv ing  a body of  data  smal l  enough %0 be qu ick ly  prepared .  
S ince  two o f  the  three ,authors  are  spec ia l i s ts  in  Eng l i sh  ( the  th i rd  
i s  a computer spec ia l i s t ) ,  we ~tura l /y  ~urned to  the  pub l i shed  
volumes o f  the  5 'u~e~ d o f  ~dZ '~h D~a/~c~,  2 which embody care fu l ly  
cont ro l led  data ,  co l lec ted  w i th  pro fess iona l  sk i l l ,  and presented  in  
conven ient  tabu lar  form in  met icu lous ly  ed i ted  and pr in ted  volumes.  
And s ince  une o f  the  two areas  coveredby the  volumes in  pr in t  a t  the  
time the study was ~adertaken (May 1969) was the south of England, 
the problem of the voicing of initial fricatives in the southwest 
naturally suggested itself. This lyrohlem had the further advs~tage, 
for our purposes, of dea//ng with cm~sonants (s inkier than vowels in 
most varieties of English) in /D/tial position, hence easily sorted 
and exsmined. The selection of this proble~ has proved to be a 
happy one. 
The area  covered by Volume ~ of  SED compr ises the  ten  southern -  
most count ies  of  Eng land ,  wh ich ,  w i th  the i r  key numbers in  the  S~w;ey, 
are 31 Somersetshire, 32 Wiltshire, 33 Berkshire, 3~ Surrey, 35 Kent, 
36 Cornwall, 37 Devonshire, 38 Dorsetshire, 39 Hampshire, and h0 
Sussex. A :~ "~i of 75 localities in this area were reported os by 
the Su~ey;  in what follows these will be identified by a four-digit 
r 
number, the first two digits indicating the county and the remaining 
two the locality. Thus 3906 stands for Burley, the sixth locality 
listed in hampshire, accordi~to the numbered list on p. 31 of the 
Introduction to the 8ul-oey. The data selected for examination 
3 
included all those words beginning with graphic f-, s-, or th- 
followed by a vowel or voiced consonant which were starred in the 
~ED questionnaire. 3 To this list we later added a few non-starred 
words which showed universal distribution and were otherwise of 
interest. The final list contained 68 words, of which 27 are f-words, 
22 s-words, 16 Sh-words and 3 ah-words (i.e. words beginning with /~/ 
in standard English). We took only the first recorded form from 
each locality; this is presumably a citation form, produced by 8n 
informant in response to a question, and recorded in narrow IPA trans- 
cription. The 59 cases where no response was given were coded XXX 
in our computer code. 
The corpus thus comprised 68 x 75 or 5100 items, including the 
59 blanks. Our c~,puter expert then produced 68 decks of punch-cards, 
one  for each word~ each deck containing 75 cards, one for each local- 
ity, These were numbered at the left for locality and on the right 
for the reference number of the item in the SED questionnaire. ~ A 
coding system was devised which preserved all significant features of 
the phonetic transcription while passing over apparently irrelevant 
fine points (see Appendix A), and the words were transcribed in this 
code directly onto the cards for the guidance of the key-puncher, 
who then punched the coded words in a fixed place on the cards. 
Subsequently the standard spelling was inserted by the computer to 
the left of the coded phonetic spelling. This whole process took 
about a dozen hours of the investigators' time (not counting the 
relatively simple progras~ing involved) and about the same amount of 
the key-puncher's time. The result was a body of data consisting of 
5100 entries of the following sort: 
3101 FINGER FIgG)R. 6 7 7 
This is to be interpreted as indicating that at locality 3101 (Weston 
in Somerset) the word f~nger, which appears as item VI.7.7 of the 
SED questionnaire, is pronounced \[f,ngar-\] (or perhaps more accu- 
rately /ftngar-/ in the quasi-phonemic transcription used). 
The nature of the problem with which we are dealing ms~ be most 
simply introduced by an excerpt frc~ the full treatment given to the 
voicing of initial fricatives in Middle English by Horn and Lehnert 
(195~, Vol. If, ~37):  
In gewissen Mnndarten sind in alter Zeit im Wortanlaut die 
starken und stimmlosen Reibelaute f, s und ~ vor Vokalen und 
schwachen, stimmhaften Konsonanten schwach und stimmhaft 
gew0rden: f- ? v-, s- > z-, ~- ? 6- . . . Die neuenglische Hoch- 
sprache hat einige ~6rter aus den Mundarten au fgen~n. . .  
Die starken und stimmlosen Reibelaute im Wortanlaut sind 
in Kent und im sUdSstlichen Mittelland schwach und stimmhaft 
geworden. In me. Handsehriften wird v f'dr anlautendes ~ vor 
vor Vok~len geschrieben, z f~r enlautendes e vor Vokalen, . . . 
Wit d~rfen annehmen, da~ aueh stimmloses th- stimmhaft geworden 
ist, da heutige Mundarten f'dr ~-  ebenso wie f~r f- ,rod s- 
I 
stimmhafte Laute haben. . .  
Aus der Tatsache, da~ franzSsische Lehnw~rter im Me. ~- mud 
s- beibehalten . . . geht hervor, da~ die stimmlosen Reibalaute in 
den englischen WSrtern schon vor der Aufnahme der franzSsischen 
LehnwSrter stimmhaft geworden waren... 
5 
Der Lautwandel hat sich im Laufe der Zeit von Kent aus h'oer 
die s~dliehen und angrenzenden ~stlichen Grafschaften ausge- 
dehnt, ~uld zwar hat er heute in dlesen Gebieten anlautendes 
ebenso ergriffen wie fund  s. Vereinzelt ist auch anlautendes 
~, zu ~ geworden . . .  In den heutigen Mundarten yon Kent, Surrey 
und Sussex sind die anlautenden stinunhaften Laute unter dem 
Einfluss des Hochenglischen durch stimmlose ersetzt worden, 
w ~ d  das ~stliche Herefordshire, Teile von Gloucestershire, 
das westliche Berkshire, und besonders Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, 
Scaersetshire told Devonshire stinunhafte Reibelaute im Anlaut 
aufweisen. 
Horn-Lehnert go on to point out that by analogy and under the 
influence of Standard English, initial f- and s- in French loanwords 
have become voiced. This is borne out in our corpus by the words 
~ ,  ~Grmer, and ~ers ,  which have initial v- in more than half 
the localities included. As our subsequent discussion and maps will 
show, Horn-Lehnert should have included in the initial voiced frica- 
tive area the western half of Hampshire and all but the southwest tip 
of Cornwall. Since the SED records for Herefordshire and Gloucester- 
shire have not yet been published, we have not been able to include 
these  count ies  in  our survey.  
The t rad i t iona l  assumpt ions ,  then ,  are that  ~- ,  s - jand  ~- .  
bee~ne vo iced  (except  be fore  vo ice less  consonants)  in  in i t ia l  pos i -

te r  o f  the  sound change, to  produce vo ic ing  of  in i t ia l  2-  and a -  
in French loanwords and of initial ~- in native words like 8hiZlir~ 
as well as French words like sure, and o the~se  to create a mixed 
situation in the whole southern area. 5 Our project was to see what 
light the records of the SED can throw on this situation by exploit- 
ing them in some of the many ways made possible by computer techno- 
logy. 
The first step was to sort the data in as many ways as we felt 
would be productive. Accordingly our computer expert produced four 
lists of the 5100 items, sorted as follows : 
List I: sorted first by keyword (the standard English graphic 
word identifying the item) alphabetically; then by locality. 
This list presents the data in the same kind of order in which 
it appears in the SED records and allows easy inspection of all 
versions of each word in one list. 
List II: sorted first by locality and than by keyword alphabet- 
ically. 'Fais list brings together in one place all the records 
from each locality and thus permits comparison of the 8mount of 
voicing recorded fr~n various localities. 
List Ill: sorted first by locality and then by citation (the 
recorded local form) alphanumerically. This list even more 
6 
7 
graphically reveals the -mount of initial voicing; it also makes 
it easy to surmise from inspection whether or not incidence of 
initial voicing might be influenced by the following vowel or 
cG~Is onsIlt. 
List IV: sorted first on the second and following characters of 
the citation form, in linguistically significant order (i.e. by  
vowels and consonants in articulatory order), then by the first 
character. This list greatly facilitates looking into the 
question of the possible influence of following sounds on initial 
voicing. 
These lists, though interesting in themselves, were cmm~idered 
primarily as intermediate diagnosti~ procedures, to be used to guide 
us in future ~ortlng, counting, and eventually mapping. Even the most 
cursory inspeetiou of them revealed what we had suspected frc~ our 
first look at the data: that there is tremendous variatio~ within 
the relevant area both from word to word and from locality to local- 
i ty. It ~ertainly seemed, at least so far as this feature in this 
region is concerned, that the maxim attributed to Gilli~ron, "Every 
word has its own history," is true. 
Accordingly we asked our c~nputer expert for various more soph- 
isticated sortings and counts, and for two kinds of maps, to be pro- 
duced by the CalCump plotter (see Appendix B). These were the 
following: 
i. A table for each of the four sets of words, listing all words 
7 
8 
i n  the  set  and count ing  the  number o f  each occnr r f~ in i t ia l  conson-  
ant ,  the  words to  be ranked in  descend ing  order  o f  the  n~ber  o f  
in i t ia l  vo iced  consonants  recorded .  ~ese  are  reproduced  here  as 
Tables i - 4. 
2. A list of all possible ~vowels, d ipht~s ,  and second conson- 
ants in each set of words, counted and tabulated in terms of each 
possible initial consonant. A portion of this list is reproduced 
herewith as Table 5. 
3. An individual map for each of the 68 words, showing the 
initial consonant recorded for each locality. Eight of these are 
reproduced here as Maps 6-13. 
4. Four proportional maps, one for each set of words, indica- 
ting at each locality the voiceless:voiced ratios; thus for the 
~h-words the legend 3/13 occurring at B905 indicates that at that 
locality only three of the 16 d-words begin with voiceless consau- 
ants. Map I shows the proportianal map for the e-words as it came 
from the plotter, while maps derived frc~ these proportional maps to 
reveal the varyiug distributions more clearly are included as Maps 
2 -5 .  
Tables i - ~ s~pport our suspicion that each word has its own 
un ique  d i s t r ibut ion  w i th  regard  to  the  in i t ia l  c~nsonant .  Thus Table 
1 uhows that  ~ the  f -words  the  propor t ion  o f  vo ice less  to  vo iced  
ranges  f r~ 20:5~ in  F~.LT~ to  52:22 in  FOAL. Even in  those  cases  
vhere  the  propor t ions  a re  the  same,  recourse  to List I ~eveals ~hat

the geographical distribution is not identical. Thus items 5 - 7 on 
the table all have a voiceless-voiced ratio of 30:45, but the voice- 
less localities, at least in the area to the west of the major iso- 
gloss to be described below, are not the same. FERN (see Map 13) 
is voiceless at 3102, 3604, 3902, and 3907 and voiced at 3405 and 
h003~ FINGER is voiceless at 3405, 3902~ 3907, and 4003 and voiced 
at 3102 and 3604; FIRE is voiceless at 3102, 3405, 3604, and 4003, 
and voiced at 3902 and 3907. In tabular form: 
FERN F V F F F V . 
FINGER V F ~ V F F F 
FIRE F F F V V F 
The same kind of discrepancy is shown by items 9 -  ii, with 33:42 
ratio, and items 12 - 14, with 34:41. 
Table i also shows that neither etymology nor following conson- 
ant seems to affect the distribution markedly. The three French 
words, FLOUR, FARMER, and FLOWERS, appear in the middle of the list, 
with ratios of 35:40, 37:38, and 39:36 respectively. The words with 
initial ~-  are also in the middle, ranging from FLEAS 33:42 to 
FLOWERS 39: 36. 
The three last words on the list, with ratios 41:23, 52:22, and 
40:22, all show some peculiarity in the recordings indicating that 
for many of the informants they were unfamiliar, learned, or bookish 
words, hence more likely to have standard English pronunciation. Thus

FORD, the expected response to the question "Sometimes there is no 
bridge (over a rivulet). What do you call that shallow place where 
you can walk across?" (SED IV.1.3), was not known, not found, or 
not recorded in seven localities, replaced by a local term (splash, 
sluice) in four others, and given as a "suggested word" (i.e. one 
pronounced first by the field worker) in nine others. Though FOAL 
is recorded from all but one locality in answer to III.~.l, it is 
revealed by the answers to another question (III.4.6) that in many 
localities the preferred word is colt. The records also show that 
FORKS (the agricultural kind), not recorded from 13 localities, 
yields to ~ other preferred local words (picks, prongs, spuds) in many 
others. Likewise it has a mixed etymology, being derivable from 
Latin furca either through OE forca or Anglo-Norman fourque. 
At the top of the list two words, FELLIES and FURROW, show 
unusual distribution in that voiced forms extend well into the usual- 
ly voiceless areas of Berkshire, Sussex, and the tip of Cornwall (see 
Maps 6 and 7). FELLIES also shows six instances of the substitution 
of the dental fricative for the labial, which otherwise occurs only 
in FRIDAY, and which is reversed in six occurrences of /v/ in THATCH. 
If these five words are set aside, the range of voiceless-voiced 
i 
ratios, from 28:~7 to 43:3~ much more closely resembles that of the 
th-words (Table 3), which range from 29:45 to 41:33. 
Observations in similar detail can also be made on the basis o f  
Tables 2 - 4, but exigencies of space suggest abridgement. 6 The

marked drop-off in voiced forms in the last five words of Table 2 
implies that, in contrast to initial ~-, the voicing of initial 8- 
is much reduced by a following nasal or /i/ (this will be discussed 
further below). Voicing is not to be expected before a voiceless 
consonant; we included STITCH because it shows one freakish occur- 
rence of initial \[z\] at 3901. In this set the French words~ SECOND, 
SUE~f, and SEXTON, do appear well down the list, with ratios of ~4:31, 
~5:30, and 53:22 respectively. If the words of French origin and 
those with a consonant after the initial 8- are set aside, the 
remaining range of ratios, from 29:46 to 38:37, comes much closer to 
that of the other sets. 
The th-words in Table 3 are, of course, all native words, since 
neither Norman nor Central French has had initial dental fricatives 
at any time when borrowing into English could occur. Likewise the 
only consonant that occurs at all frequently after initial /8/ or /~/ 
is /r/. Hence the range of ratios of the whole set is narrower than 
those of the f- and 8-words. Noteworthy is the fact that throughout 
the voiced area, the initial cluster /@r/ appears as /dr/, presumably 
as a result of a later change of /~/ to /d/ in this environment.7 
(See Map 8 for THRESH). This same change has occurred in THISTLE in 
western Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall (see Map 9), and in THATCH (Map 
i0) in south Devon and eastern Cornwall. These two words also show 
initial /v/ sporadically in Somerset and Dorset, presumably a substi- 
tution the opposite of that occurring in FELLIES in five localities.

One loca l i ty ,  3805 (Kingston, Dorset) ,  even has /v /  in  THISTLE and 
I~/  in  FELLIES. Why only two o f  the 16 %h-words should show th i s  
kind of substitutic~ remains unexplained. ~here is certainly nothing 
in their etymology to account for it. 
Table ~ lists the only three sh-words that show more than a few 
scattered instances of initial /~/" The other ~tarred words of this 
sort, with the number of occurrences of initial voicing for each, are 
8heuf ~, s~ep i, she~f 3j 8hoe 2, and sh~;eZ 3. Even the three 
words listed have a ratio characteristic of the low end of the other 
lists: 52:22 for SUGAR (a French loanword), 57:18 for the native 
word "SHILLING, and 62:13 for another French word, SURE. Presumably 
the two French words had sc~ellhing like initial \[s J-\] at the time of 
borrowing, while 8~ILL~N~ and the other native words had /s~-/ until 
later OE. Instances of voicing in these words is to be attributed 
wholly to analogy, prest~ably with the s-words. As might be 
expected, the heaviest concentration of voiced forms is in the "hard- 
core" voicing areas in Devonshire and western Hampshire (see Map 5), 
but there are scattered instances in Sc~ereet, Dorset, and Wilts. 
(see Map ii for SHILLING). 
Just as Tables i - 4 reveal the wide variety in voiceless-voiced 
ratio for individual words, so Maps 2 - 5 show the same variety for 
individual localities. These m~ps have been simplified from the 
or ig ina l  cce~uter-produced proport iona l  maps described above, which 
were in the form shown in Map 1. Taken together ,  they de~nst ra te

(3901 and 3902) showing respectively total voicing and total voice- 
lessness in the th-words. A little to the north of this it sepa- 
rates two localities--Burbage, Wilts., and Inkpen, Berks.--which are 
only 8 miles apart and yet show voiceless voiced ratios of @:16 and 
15:1 respectively in the th-words. It is equally well marked for the 
other sets, though in the case of the f-words the ~explicable eastern 
extension of voicing in two words--FELLIES AND FURR0W--creates the 
appearance of a transitional area (Map 2). 
The maps also show that the voicing did not extend to the south- 
west tip of Cornwall except in a few words. Presumably the English 
brought into this formerly Celtic area was more strongly influenced 
by standard English. The extreme case is represented by 3607, which 
has voicing in only two of the 68 words: FELLIES and FURROW, which, 
as we have seen above also extend beyond the voicing area on the east.

Maps 2 - 5 also reveal rather similar patterns of voicing in 
different parts of the region. Just west of the main eastern iso- 
gloss is an area where voicing is virtually total for all sets of 
words. The area differs in size from one set to another, being 
larger for the f- and th-words than for the s- and sh-words, but i t s  
heart is western Hampshire, Dorset, and part of southern Wiltshire. 
It is separated from the other area of almost total voicing in Devon- 
shire by a mixed area in Somerset and Wiltshire where the proportion 
of voicing among the words examined ranges from 25% to 75%. 
Finally there are fringe areas in the east and in southern Cornwall 
where ~ ly  a few of the words~those  high on the lists in Tables 
1 - h--show voicing. In the light of the traditional historical view 
of a feature spreading west from Kent, as ex~pressed in the quotation 
from Horn-Lehnert above, this distribution is a bit puzzling. Full 
exploration of its implications must be postponed to a later study. 
One possible explanation of the variation in the incidence of 
voicing from one word to another is to be sought in the influence of 
the sounds immediately following the initial fricative. Chart I 
displm~vs some of the characteristics of the four sets with regard to 
to following phonemes. The sh-words have far less initial voicing 
than the other sets. No more thou 22 localities have initial voicing 
for any single word in this set. On the other hand, the s-words dem- 
omStrate the widest range: frc~ voicing in 46 localities to a long 
tail of words with no initial voicing anywhere. The most stable is 
29 
lkA 
i 
3O 
15 
the th- set, which has between 45 and 33 localities with voicing. 
This means that for all words but one in this set, over half the 
localities have a voiced initial fricative. This is the highest 
proportion for any set. 
The sound following the initial fricative has been indicated on 
Chart I in terms of three categories: 
+ vowel (unmarked) 
+ voiced consonant (marked with square) 
+ voiceless consonant (marked with dot) 
There is a striking correlation between voiceless initial fricative 
and a following voiceless consonant in the s-words (no other set has 
a voiceless consonant in second position). With the exception of 
spring (72:3) and STITCH (74:1), the association is absolute for 
Ik/ school, scratch, sky, squirrel 
(s) + /p/ spade, speak, spokes 
It~ stars, steal, stile, stool, straw 
0nly STITCH has been included in the computation. 
Voiced consonants in second position of s-words also associate 
with initial /s/ rather than /z/: 
~ /w/ SWRAT (41:34~ SWEAR (52:23) 
J/n/ SNOW (59:16), SNObT (70:4) <s> + ! 
I /m/ SMOKE (60:15) 
~/1/ SLEDGE (68:3) 
In the case of the other sets, however, there is no clear connection:

Vowels present a more complex situation. Table 6 shows that for 
f-, s-, and th-words, high and low front vowels /y, i; ~/ and low 
central vowels /a, a/ associate with initial voicing. For the three 
sets taken together the proportion of voiced initial fricatives occur- 
ring with these vowels following is between 60 and 63 per cent.

There is negative association between voicing and mid front /e, e, c?/ 
as well as low back vowels /D, 3/. A study of t~e values for the 
individual sets reveals that initial voicing is particularly associ- 
ated with high and low front vowels in f-words (72% and 78% respec- 
tively) and with low central vowels in 8- and th-words (77% and 83%).

In f- and th-words low back vowels have a particularly low sssocia- 
ti(m with initial voicing (20% and 30%, respectively). Vowel length 
appears to have no appreciable correlation with the voicing or 
unvoicing of the initial fricative. 
Rounded high front vowels /Y, y/ showed a more marked associa- 
tion with initial voicing than unrounded high front vowels /I, i/. 
The ratios for all f- and s-words with rounded front vowels are: 
FOOT @:16; SOOT 1:15, SUCK @:7, SUET 1:15. If we make a table for all 
the second vowels in SOOT (Map 12), we get: 
Central Back 
High i:15 @:i 32:19 
1:2 Mid 
Low 
There is, of course, a possibility here of pseudo-correlation, caused 
for instance by the possibility that those localities which have 
the fronted /Y/ for standard English /U/ in words like SOOT happen 
to be located in the area of strongest voicing. Investigation of this 
possibility must await further study. 
The tendency for high front vowels generally to co-occur with 
voiced initial fricatives is, however, obvious in words like FERN 
(Map 13) where no rounding is involved: 
F ront  Central 
~:ib 
Mid @:2 30:21 
Low @:6 
35 
18 
Finally, to illustrate the difference in correlation with low central 
and low back vowels, we may cite the figures for FORTY. The 
voiceless:voiced ratio with a low central vowel \[a, a:, a, a:\] is 
13:17~ while with a low back \[D, ~\] it is 27:18. 
It is clear that even more study, of individual words and indi- 
vidual localities, is needed before all the complications of this 
one  dialect feature can be unraveled. We should, for example~ take 
into account the second and third responses for many of the words~ 
many of which were taken from incidental conversation and hence are 
inclined to be more natural. Even casual inspection of the data 
indicates that they show a much higher incidence of initial voicing 
than do the citation forms. But we hope that this paper has shown 
that, given adequate and convenient data, the computer can be of 
inestimable aid to the dialectologist.

5For an alt~rn~ive theory, holding that initial fricatives were 
already voiced in the language of the Jutes and Frisians who settled 
Kent, see Bennett 1955 in Bibliography. 
6We hope to explore the linguistic implications of this project more 
fully in a later article. 
7One instance of /~r-/ in THRESH is reported from 3905 Hambledon,

APP~IX  B, PREPARIRG THE MAPS 
by  Gera ld  M. Rubin 
When i t  was f i r s t  dec ided  to  produce  d ia lec t  maps by computer ,  
severa l  methods  were d i scussed .  Output  cou ld  be in t r i ca te ly  p laced  
c~ a pr in ted  page ,  and then  a map out l ine  cou ld  be super imposed on 
that  page by hand.  In  th i s  way we cou ld  ach ieve  our  bas ic  goa l ,  that  
o f  hav ing  the  computer  de the  ted ious  task  o f  sor t ing  and ta l l y ing  
the  l ingu is t i c  data  to  be d i sp layed ,  wh i le  leav ing  a minimum of  work 
to  the  researcher .  But th i s  idea  was not  p l iab le  enough to  le t  us  
represent  a map as  i t  ac tua l ly  i s .  The squareness  of  the  fo rmat  and 
the  constant  d i s tance  between characters  on the  pr in ted  page made i t  
imposs ib le  to  reproduce  any map w i th  su f f i c ient  accuracy .  
A second method d iscussed  was to  output  the  ent i re  map and data  
on a v i sua l  d i sp lay  un i t  such as a CRT scope .  Here we cou ld  draw the  
map, but  our  p r in t ing  fo rmat  was aga in  too  s t r i c t .  Th is  method a l so  
i s  expens ive ,  s ince  i t  requ i res  the  use  o f  an on- l ine  scope .  
We f ina l ly  dec ided  upon an o f f - l ine  p lo t te r .  The one we used 
was a CalCump #563 D ig i ta l  P lo t te r .  Th is  machine takes  a conputer  
tape  which has been prodneed by an on- l ine  computer  p rogram and 
draws the  date  in  the  tape  onto  a ro l l  o f  paper .  In  o rder  to  v i sua l -  
i ze  how the  p lo t te r  works ,  imagine a set  o f  coord inate  axes w i th  a 
y-axis about 12" long and an infinitely long x-axis. This grid is 
the piece of paper to he plotted on. The instructions to the plotter 
are simple. They boil down to two: , ~ lower or raise the pen point 
(so it wil l  or wil l  not write as it moves) and move the pen in a 
straight line to location (x,y) on the grid. In this manner anything 
can be drawn, f r~  straight lines to circles, letters, and numbers 
(curves are actually made up of very short straight line segments ). 
The routines used to produce CalComp tapes are FORTRAN sub- 
routines. It was therefore necessary to write a FORTRAN program 
whose input would be (i) instructions for drawing the outline of a 
map and plotting localities within it, and (2) linguistic data in a 
specially processed format. The output would be the tape which 
directs the p lo t ter .  
24 
Two methods were tried out for producing the map outline. In 
the first, a transparent grid was placed over a map and coordinates 
of "bends" in the outline were recorded. Thus a map would be pro- 
duced by moving in a straight line from one bend to another. The 
map produced by this method gave only a rough approximation of the 
original because we could not find a grid small enough to represent 
accurately all the bends and curves in the outline of the map. The 
second method was much more successful. A digitizer was used to 
measure and record the coordinates of bonds in the outline and the 
positions of the localities within the area covered. The digitizer 
(~sed by courtesy of the American Mathematical Society, Providence, 
R.I.) consists of a large table and a "bomb-sight" connected to a 
paper-tape punch. The crosshairs of the bombsight are moved along 
the  out l ine  o f  the  map, and a l l  coord inates  a re  accurate ly  measured  
and  p~ched onto  paper  tape .  Th is  paper  tape  then  becomes the  d i rec t  
input  to  the  computer .  Spec ia l  codes  were used  to  ins t ruc t  the  p lo t -  
te r  to  l i f t  the  pen  ( to  move away and draw an i s land ,  fo r  example)  o r  
to  ind icate  that  the  next  coord inates  wou ld  be the  pos i t ions  o f  
loca l i t ies  on the  map. When the  program was completed ,  the  ins t ruc -  
t ions  fo r  d rawing  the  out l ine  o f  Eng land  and mark ing  the  coord inates  
of the 311 localities of the SurUey of EngZish D4uleot8 required 
about 4000 x and y measurements. \[For the present paper only the 
bottom quarter of the map, with 75 localities, was used.\] 
The raw linguistic data was keypunched onto cards using the 
phonetic coding discussed above (Appendix A). Also on the cards were 
the numbers of the county and locality and the keywords. For example, 
the card for SUGAR, county 31, locality ~, was 
310~ SU~A~ ;%G)R: 5. 8.10 
f 
Since the corpus of data included 68 words for each of the 75 loc- 
alities in Southern England, the card input consisted of 5100 cards. 
These records could be sorted by phonetic word (citation), by locality, 
by key~ord, or by any combination of these. 
42  
25 
A PL / I  p rogram was wr i t ten  to  examine the  records  and to  output  
the  l ingu is t i c  resu l t s  which were to  be drawn onto a map. Th is  
output  was then  read  in  by the  FORTRAN p lo t t ing  program.  The input  
to  the  p lo t t ing  program was o f  a s tandard  fo rmat :  
MAP NB~4BER; COUNTY; LOCALITY; NUMBER OF SYMBOL$; LINE NUMBER; MESSAGE 
For example, the card 
3 33 5 7 3-F/I-V 
meant "on map #3 draw the seven characters 3-F/I-V at locality 5 in 
county 33." "Line number" was used to produce the legend at the 
bottom of each map. The legend was drawn whenever the county and 
locality numbers were @. For example, the instruction 
2 ~ ~ 18 i INITIAL CONSONANTS 
meant "~ map #2 write the above message at the position for line i 
of the legend." 
The input to the plotting program came in sorted by map number. 
Whenever a new map number was read in (meaning that all the data for 
the previous map had been plotted), the program would issue instruc- 
tions to move over on the plotting paper and draw a new map outline. 
Data would then be drawn on this new map until a different one was 
requested. Thus one run of each of the PL/I and FORTRAN programs 
could produce any number of related or even unrelated maps. 
It should be apparent that the great virtues of this method of 
producing both working and finished dialectal maps are speed and 
accuracy. Anyone who has produced even rough working maps by 
stamping or drawing symbols on an outline map knows how time- 
consuming and tedious this process is, and how subject it is to 
error. The computer never wearies and never (we trustl) makes an~ 
error. As a result, the dialectologist can experiment with all kinds 
of working maps and select those which are interesting or significant. 
This should add a new dimension to the study of linguistic geography.
