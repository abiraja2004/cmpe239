Abstract
In this paper, we present the results of
experiments aiming to validate a two-
dimensional typology of affective states as
a suitable basis for affective classification
of texts. Using a corpus of English weblog
posts, annotated for mood by their authors,
we trained support vector machine binary
classifiers to distinguish texts on the ba-
sis of their affiliation with one region of
the space. We then report on experiments
which go a step further, using four-class
classifiers based on automated scoring of
texts for each dimension of the typology.
Our results indicate that it is possible to
extend the standard binary sentiment anal-
ysis (positive/negative) approach to a two
dimensional model (positive/negative; ac-
tive/passive), and provide some evidence
to support a more fine-grained classifica-
tion along these two axes.
1 Introduction
We are investigating the subjective use of language
in text and the automatic classification of texts ac-
cording to their subjective characteristics, or ?af-
fect?. Our approach is to view affective states
(such as ?happy?, ?angry?) as locations in Osgood?s
Evaluation-Activation (EA) space (Osgood et al ,
1957), and draws on work in psychology which
has a long history of work seeking to construct a
typology of such affective states (Scherer, 1984).
A similar approach has been used more recently
to describe emotional states that are expressed in
speech (Cowie and Cornelius, 2002; Schro?der and
Cowie, 2005). Our overall aim is to determine
the extent to which such a typology can be vali-
dated and applied to the task of text classification
using automatic methods. In this paper we de-
scribe some initial experiments aimed at validating
a basic two dimensional classification of weblog
data, first with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
binary classifiers, then with Pointwise Mutual In-
formation - Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). The
domain of weblog posts is particularly well-suited
for this task given its highly subjective nature and
the availability of data , including data which has
been author-annotated for ?mood?, which is a rea-
sonable approximation of ?affect?.
Recent attempts to classify weblog posts have
shown modest, but consistent improvements over
a 50% baseline, only slightly worse than human
performance (Mishne, 2005). One important mile-
stone is the elaboration of a typology of affec-
tive states. To devise such a typology, our start-
ing point is Figure 1, which is based on a model
of emotion as a multicomponent process (Scherer,
1984). In this model, the distribution of the af-
fective states is the result of analysing similar-
ity judgments by humans for 235 emotion terms1
using cluster-analysis and multidimensional scal-
ing techniques to map out the structure as a two-
dimensional space. The positioning of words is
not so much controversial as fuzzy; an affective
state such as ?angry? to describe facial expression
in speech may have a slightly different location
than an ?angry? weblog post. In this model, the
well-studied ?sentiment? classification is simply a
specific case (left vs. right halves of the space).
The experiments we describe here seek to go be-
yond this basic distinction. They involve an addi-
tional dimension of affect, the activity dimension,
allowing textual data to be classified into four cat-
egories corresponding to each of the four quad-
1Reduced to less than 100 in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Typology of affective states based on (Scherer, 1984)
rants in the space. Ultimately, once scores have
been ?promoted? to real measures, classification
can be more precise; for example, a text is not only
negative and passive, it is more precisely ?depres-
sive?. With such a more precise classification one
might, for example, be able to detect individuals
at risk of suicide. In Experiment 1, we use bi-
nary classifiers to investigate how the four quad-
rants defined by the typology hold together, the
assumption being that if the typology is correct,
the classifiers should perform substantially better
than a random baseline. In Experiment 2, we go
a step closer towards a more fine-grained classifi-
cation by evaluating the performance of an unsu-
pervised automated technique for scoring texts on
both axes. Both these experiments are preliminary
? our long term goal is to be able to validate the
whole typology in terms of computationally effec-
tive classification.
2 Corpus
We have collected from Livejournal2 a total of
346723 weblogs (mood-annotated by authors) in
2http://www.livejournal.com.
English, from which almost half are annotated
with a mood belonging to one of the four quad-
rants, described as follows:
Quadrant1 bellicose, tense, alarmed, envious,
hateful, angry, enraged, defiant, annoyed, jealous,
indignant, frustrated, distressed, disgusted, sus-
picious, discontented, bitter, insulted, distrustful,
startled, contemptuous and impatient.
Quadrant2 apathetic, disappointed, miserable,
dissatisfied, taken aback, worried, languid, feel
guilt, ashamed, gloomy, sad, uncomfortable, em-
barrassed, melancholic, depress, desperate, hes-
itant, bored, wavering, droopy, tired, insecured,
anxious, lonely and doubtful.
Quadrant3 feel well, impressed, pleased,
amourous, astonished, glad, content, hopeful,
solemn, attentive, longing, relaxed, serious,
serene, content, at ease, friendly, satisfied,
calm, contemplative, polite, pensive, peaceful,
conscientious, empathic, reverent and sleepy.
Quadrant4 happy, ambitious, amused, adven-
turous, aroused, astonished, triumphant, excited,
56
conceited, self confident, courageous, feeling su-
perior, enthusiastic, light hearthed, determined,
passionate, expectant, interested, joyous and de-
lighted.
In our experiments, we used 15662 from quad-
rant Q1 (see Figure 1), 54940 from Q2, 49779
from Q3 and 35634 from Q4.
3 Experiment 1: Distinguishing the four
Quadrants
Our hypothesis is that the classification of two dis-
joint sets of moods should yield a classification ac-
curacy significantly above a baseline of 50%. To
verify our hypothesis, we conducted a series of ex-
periments using machine learning to classify we-
blog posts according to their mood, each class cor-
responding to one particular quadrant. We used
Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 2001) with
three basic classic features (unigrams, POS and
stems) to classify the posts as belonging to one
quadrant or one of the three others. For each clas-
sification task, we extracted randomly 1000 test-
ing examples, and trained separately with 2000,
4000, 8000 and 16000 examples. In each case, ex-
amples were divided equally among positive and
negative examples3. The set of features used var-
ied for each of these tasks, they were selected by
thresholding each (distinct) training data set, after
removing words (unigrams) from the categories
poor in affective content (prepositions, determin-
ers, etc.). To qualify as a feature, each unigram,
POS or stem had to occur at least three times in
the training data. The value of each feature corre-
sponds to its number of occurence in the training
examples.
3.1 Results
Our hypothesis is that, if the four quadrants de-
picted in Figure 1 are a suitable arrangement for
affective states in the EA space, a classifier should
perform significantly better than chance (50%).
Table 1 shows the results for the binary classifi-
cation of the quadrants. In this table, the first col-
umn identifies the classification task in the form
?P vs N?, where ?P? stands for positive examples
and ?N? for negative examples. The ?Random? row
shows results for selecting positive and negative
examples randomly from all four quadrants. By

RANT + 500 negatives among the other three QUAD-
RANTS.
micro-averaging accuracy for the classification of
each quadrant vs all others (rows 10 to 13), we
obtain at least 60% accuracy for the four binary
classifications of the quadrants4. The first six rows
show evidence that each quadrant forms a distinc-
tive whole, as the classifer can easily decide be-
tween any two of them.

3.2 Analysis of Results
We introduce now table 2 that shows two thresh-
olds of significance (1% and 5%) for the interpre-
tation of current and coming results. For exam-
ple, if we have 1000 trials with each trial having a
probability of success of 0.5, the likelihood of get-
ting at least 53.7% of the trials right is only 1%.
This gives us a baseline to see how significantly
well above chance a classifier performs. The SVM
algorithm has linearly separated the data for each
quadrant according to lexical and POS content (the
features). The most sensible explanation is that the
features for each class (quadrant) are semantically
related, a piece of information which is relevant
for the model (see section 4). It is safe to conclude
that the results cannot be allocated to chance, that
there is something else at work that explains the

accuracies consistently well above a baseline, and
this something else is the typology. These results
show that the abstraction offered by the four quad-
rants in the model seems correct. This is also sup-
ported by the observation that the classifier shows
no improvements over the baseline if trained over
a random selection of examples in the entire space.
4 Experiment 2: Classification using
Semantic Orientation from Association
Our next goal is to be able to classify a text accord-
ing to more than four classes (positive/negative,
active/passive), by undertaking multi-category
classification of texts according to particular re-
gions of the space, (such as ?angry?, ?sad?, etc.). In
order to do that we need a scoring system for each
axis. In the following experiments we explore the
use of such scores and give some insights into how
to transform these scores of affect as measures of
affect.
Using binary classifiers, we have already estab-
lished that if we look at the lexical contents of we-
blog posts tagged according to their mood by their
author, these mood classes tend to cluster accord-
ing to a two-dimensional typology defined by their
semantic orientation: positive or negative (evalu-
ation), active or passive (activity). Beyond aca-
demic importance, the typology really becomes of
practical interest if we can classify the posts us-
ing pre-defined automated scores for both axis.
One strategy of scoring is to extract phrases, in-
cluding single words, which are good indicators
of subjectivity in texts, and score them accord-
ing to how they relate or ?associate? to one or the
other extremity of each axis. This strategy, called
Semantic Orientation (SO) from Association (A)
has been used successfully (Turney and Littman,
2003) to classify texts or adjectives of all sorts ac-
cording to their sentiments (in our typology this
corresponds to the evaluation dimension). Ac-
cording to these scores, a text or adjective can be
said to have, for example, a more or less positive
or negative evaluation. We will use this strategy to
go further in the validation of our model of affec-
tive states by scoring also the activity dimension;
to our knowledge, this is the first time this strat-
egy is employed to get (text) scores for dimen-
sions other than evaluation. In SO-A, we score
the strength of the association between an indica-
tor from the text and a set of positive or negative
words (the paradigms Pwords and Nwords) cap-
turing the very positive/active or negative/passive
semantic orientation of the axis poles. To get the
SO-A of a text, we sum over positive scores for
indicators positively related to Pwords and nega-
tively related to Nwords and negative scores for
indicators positively related to Nwords and nega-
tively related to Pwords. In mathematical terms,
the SO-A of a text is:
Text
?
ind
(
Pwords
?
p
A(ind, p) ?
Nwords
?
n
A(ind, n))
where ind stands for indicator. Note that the quan-
tity of Pwords must be equal to Nwords.
To compute A, (Kamps et al , 2004) focus
on the use of lexical relations defined in Word-
Net5 and define a distance measure between two
terms which amounts to the length of the short-
est path that connects the two terms. This strat-
egy is interesting because it constrains all values
to belong to the [-1,+1] range, but can be applied
only to a finite set of indicators and has yet to
be tested for the classification of texts. (Turney
and Littman, 2003) use Pointwise Mutual Infor-
mation - Information Retrieval (PMI-IR); PMI-IR
operates on a wider variety of multi-words indi-
cators, allowing for contextual information to be
taken into account, has been tested extensively on
different types of texts, and the scoring system can
be potentially normalized between [-1,+1], as we
will soon see. PMI (Church and Hanks, 1990) be-
tween two phrases is defined as:
log2
prob(ph1 is near ph2)
prob(ph1) ? prob(ph2)
PMI is positive when two phrases tend to co-occur
and negative when they tend to be in a comple-
mentary distribution. PMI-IR refers to the fact
5http://wordnet.princeton.edu/.
58
that, as in Informtion Retrieval (IR), multiple oc-
currences in the same document count as just one
occurrence: according to (Turney and Littman,
2003), this seems to yield a better measure of
semantic similarity, providing some resistance to
noise. Computing probabilities using hit counts
from IR, this yields to a value for PMI-IR of:
logn
N ? (hits(ph1 NEAR ph2) + 1/N)
(hits(ph1) + 1) ? (hits(ph2) + 1)
where N is the total number of documents in the
corpus. We are going to use this method for com-
puting A in SO-A, which we call SO-PMI-IR. The
configuration depicted in the remaining of this sec-
tion follows mostly (Turney and Littman, 2003).
Smoothing values (1/N and 1) are chosen so that
PMI-IR will be zero for words that are not in the
corpus, two phrases are considered NEAR if they
co-occur within a window of 20 words, and log2has been replaced by logn, since the natural log ismore common in the literature for log-odds ratio
and this makes no difference for the algorithm.
Two crucial aspects of the method are the choice
of indicators to be extracted from the text to be
classified, as well as the sets of positive and neg-
ative words to be used as paradigms for the eval-
uation and activity dimensions. The five part-of-
speech (POS) patterns from (Turney, 2002) were
used for the extraction of indicators, all involving
at least one adjective or adverb. POS tags were
acquired with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994)6. Ide-
ally, words used as paradigms should be context
insensitive, i.e their semantic orientation is either
always positive or negative. The adjectives good,
nice, excellent, positive, fortunate, correct, supe-
rior and bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate,
wrong, inferior were used as near pure representa-
tions of positive and negative evaluation respec-
tively, while fast, alive, noisy, young and slow,
dead, quiet, old as near pure representations of ac-
tive and passive activity (Summers, 1970).
Departing from (Turney and Littman, 2003),
who uses the Alta Vista advanced search with ap-
proximately 350 millions web pages, we used the
Waterloo corpus7, with approximately 46 millions
pages. To avoid introducing confusing heuristics,
we stick to the configuration described above, but
(Turney and Littman, 2003) have experimented
with different configuation in computing SO-PMI-
IR.

4.1 The Typology and SO-PMI-IR
We now use the typology with an automated scor-
ing method for semantic orientation. The results
are presented in the form of a Confusion Matrix
(CM). In this and the following matrices, the top-
left cell indicates the overall accuracy8, the POS-
itive (ACTive) and NEGative (PASsive) columns
represent the instances in a predicted class, the
P/T column (where present) indicates the average
number of patterns per text (blog post), E/P indi-
cates the average evaluation score per pattern and
A/P indicates the average activity score per pat-
tern. Each row represents the instances in an ac-
tual class9.
First, it is useful to get a clear idea of how
the SO-PMI-IR experimental setup we presented
compares with (Turney and Littman, 2003) on a
human-annotated set of words according to their
evaluation dimension: the General Inquirer (GI,
(Stone, 1966)) lexicon is made of 3596 words
(1614 positives and 1982 negatives)10. Table 3
summarizes the results. (Turney and Littman,
(U) 76.4% POS NEG E/P
POS(1614) 59.3% 40.7% 1.5
NEG(1982) 9.6% 90.4% -4.3
(T) 82.8% POS NEG E/P
POS(1614) 81.2% 18.8% 3.2
NEG(1982) 15.8% 84.2% -3.6
Table 3: CM for the GI: (U)Us and (T)(Turney and
Littman, 2003)
2003) reports an accuracy of 82.8% while clas-
sifying those words, while our experiment yields
an accuracy of 76.4% for the same words. Their
results show that their classifier errs very slightly
towards the negative pole (as shown by the accura-
cies of both predicted classes) and has a very bal-
anced distribution of the word scores (as shown
by the almost equal but opposite in signs values
of E/Ps). This is some evidence that the paradigm
words are appropriate as near pure representations
of positive and negative evaluation. By contrast,
8Recall that table 2 gives an interpretation of the statistical
signifiance of accuracy, with trials ? 750 and Prob(success)
= 0.5.
9For example, in the comparative evaluation shown in ta-
ble 3, our classifier classified 59.3% of the 1614 positive in-
stances as positive and 40.7% as negative, with an average
score of 1.5 per pattern.
10Note that all moods in the typology present in the GI
have the same polarity for evaluation in both, which is some
evidence in favour of the typology.
59
our classifier appears to be more strongly biased
towards the negative pole, probably due to the use
of different corpora. This bias11should be kept in
mind in the interpretation of the results to come.
The second experiment focuses on the words
from the typology. Table 4 shows the results. The
81.1% POS NEG P/T E/P
POS(43) 60.5% 39.5% 1 0.4
NEG(47) 0.0% 100.0% 1 -6.4
66.7% ACT PAS P/T A/P
ACT(39) 33.3% 66.7% 1 -0.9
PAS(51) 7.8% 92.2% 1 -2.9
Table 4: CM for the Typology affective states
value of 1 under P/T reflects the fact that the ex-
periment amounts, in practical terms, to classify-
ing the annotation of the post (a single word). For
the evaluation dimension, there is another shift to-
wards the negative pole of the axis, which suggests
that words in the typology are distributed not ex-
actly as shown on figure 1, but instead appear to
have a true location shifted towards the negative
pole. The activity dimension also appear to have
a negative (i.e passive) bias. There are two main
possible reasons for that: words in the typology
should be shifted towards the passive pole (as in
the evaluation case), or the paradigm words for the
passive pole are not pure representations of the ex-
tremity of the pole 12.
Having established that our classifier has a neg-
ative bias for both axes, we now turn to the classifi-
cation of the quadrants per se. In the next section,
we used SO-PMI-IR to classify 1000 randomnly
selected blog posts from our corpus, i.e 250 in
each of the four quadrants. Some of these posts
were found to have no pattern and were therefore
not classified, which means that less than 1000
posts were actually classified in each experiment.
We also report on the classification of an impor-
tant subcategory of these moods called the Big Six
emotions.
11Bias can be introduced by the use of a small corpus, inad-
equate paradigm words or typology. In practice, a quick fix
for neutralizing bias would be to normalize the SO-PMI-IR
values by subtracting the average. This work aims at tuning
the model to remove bias introduced by unsound paradigm
words or typology.
12At the time of experimenting, we were not aware
of an equivalent of the GI to independently verify our
paradigm words for activity, but one reviewer pointed out
such a resource, see http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/
?inquirer/spreadsheet_guide.htm.

Of the 1000 blog posts, there were 938 with at
least one pattern. Table 5 shows the accuracy for
the classification of these posts.

Table 5: CM for all Moods
An important set of emotions found in the liter-
ature (Ekman, 1972) has been termed the Big Six.
These emotions are fear, anger, happiness, sad-
ness, surprise and disgust. We have used a mini-
mally extended set, adding love and desire (Cowie
and Cornelius, 2002), to cover all four quadrants
(we called this set the Big Eight). Fear, anger and
disgust belong to quadrant 1, sadness and surprise
(we have taken it to be a synonym of ?taken aback?
in the typology) belong to quadrant 2, love and
desire (taken to be synonyms of ?amorous? and
?longing? in the typology) belong to quadrant 3
and happy to quadrant 4. Table 6 shows the results
for the classification of the blog posts that were
tagged with one of these emotions. This amounts
to classifying the posts containing only the Big
Eight affective states.

PAS(461) 21.0% 79.0% 8 -4.6
Table 6: CM for the Big Eight
In the remaining two experiments, blog posts
have been classifed using a discrete scoring sys-
tem. Disregarding the real value of SO, each pat-
tern was scored with a value of +1 for a positive
score and -1 for a negative score. This amounts to
counting the number of patterns on each side and
has the advantage of providing a normalized value
for E/T and A/T between -1 and +1. Normalized
values are the first step towards a measure of af-
fect, not merely a score, in the sense that it gives
an estimate of the strength of affect. We have not
60
classified the posts for which the resulting score
was zero, which means that even fewer posts (741)
than the previous experiment were actually evalu-
ated. Table 7 shows the results for all moods and

4.3 Analysis of Results
Our concerns about the paradigm words for eval-
uating the activity dimension are clearly revealed
in the classification results. The classifier shows a
heavy negative (passive) bias in all experiments.
The overall accuracy for activity is consistently
below that for evaluation: three of them are not
statistically significant at 1% (51.8%, 53.3% and
52.8%) and two at even 5% (51.8% and 52.8%).
The classifier appears particularly confused in ta-
ble 5, averaging a score for active posts (-4.3)
smaller than for passive posts (-4.2). It is not
impossible that the moods present in the typol-
ogy may have to be shifted towards the passive
dimension, but further research should look first
at finding better paradigm words for activity. A
good starting point for the calibration of the clas-
sifier for activity is the creation of a list of human-
annotated words for activity, comparable in size to
the GI list, combined with an experiment similar
to the one for which results are reported in table 3.
With regards to the evaluation dimension, ta-
bles 5 and 6 reveal a positive bias (despite having a
classifier which has a ?built-in? negative bias, see
section 4.1). Possible explanations for this phe-
nomenon include the use of irony by people in
negative posts, blogs which are expressed in more
positive terms than their annotation would suggest,
and failure to detect ?negative? contexts for pat-
terns ? one example of the latter is provided in
table 9. This phenomena appears to be alleviated

One way of refining the scoring system is to re-
duce the effect of scoring antonyms as high as syn-
onyms by not counting co-occurences in the cor-
pus where the word ?not? is in the neighbourhood
(Turney, 2001). Also,
The long-term goal of this research is to be
able to classify texts by locating their normal-
ized scores for evaluation and activity between
-1 and +1, and we have suggested a simple
method of achieving that by averaging over dis-
crete scores. However, by combining individual
results for evaluation and activity for each post13,
we can already classify text into one of the four
quadrants, and we can expect the average accuracy
of this classification to be approximately the prod-
uct of the accuracy for each dimension. Table 10
shows the results for the classification directly into
quadrants of the 727 posts already classified into
halves (E?, A?) in table 8. The overall accuracy
is 31.1% (expected accuracy is 59.8% * 52.8% =
31.6%). There are biases towards Q2 and Q3, but
no clear cases of confusion between two or more
classes.
31.1% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4
Q1(180) 21.1% 47.8% 22.2% 8.9%
Q2(174) 15.5% 51.1% 25.3% 8.0%
Q3(192) 9.9% 42.2% 40.1% 7.8%
Q4(181) 9.4% 33.7% 44.8% 12.2%

Finally, our experiments show no correlation
between the length of a post (in number of pat-
terns) and the accuracy of the classification.
13For example, a post with E- and A+ would be classified
in Q1.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have used a machine learning ap-
proach to show that there is a relation between the
semantic content of texts and the affective state
they (wish to) convey, so that a typology of affec-
tive states based on semantic association is a good
description of the distribution of affect in a two-
dimensional space. Using automated methods to
score semantic association, we have demonstrated
a method to compute semantic orientation on both
dimensions, giving some insights into how to go
beyond the customary ?sentiment? analysis. In the
classification experiments, accuracies were always
above a random baseline, although not always sta-
tistically significant. To improve the typology and
the accuracies of classifiers based on it, a better
calibration of the activity axis is the most press-
ing task. Our next steps are experiments aiming
at refining the translation of scores to normalized
measures, so that individual affects can be distin-
guished within a single quadrant. Other interest-
ing avenues are studies investigating how well the
typology can be ported to other textual data do-
mains, the inclusion of a ?neutral? tag, and the
treatment of texts with multiple affects.
Finally, the domain of weblog posts is attractive
because of the easy access to annotated data, but
we have found through our experiments that the
content is very noisy, annotation is not always con-
sistent among ?bloggers?, and therefore classifica-
tion is difficult. We should not underestimate the
positive effects that cleaner data, consistent tag-
ging and access to bigger corpora would have on
the accuracy of the classifier.
