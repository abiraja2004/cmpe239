1 Introduction 
Olle of the goals of the Eu-funded MATE project is 
to develop tools to support some of the most popu- 
lar dialogue coding activities, including annotation 
of syntactic information, information about 'corefer- 
ence,' and information about dialogue acts. 1 
A problem to be confronted when trying to de- 
velop such tools is the lack of universally agreed 
upon coding schemes for these 'levels'~-i.e., ofspeci- 
fications of a set of elements and attributes that will 
cover all of the information about that level that a 
researcher may wish to annotate, together with in- 
structions for how to do so. What does exist at the 
moment is coding schemes for particular domains 
and/or applications: in the case of dialogue acts, 
for example, there are several 'specific' schemes for 
given applications, ome of which have been shown 
to lead to reliable coding (Alexandersson etal., 1997; 
Carletta et al, 1997). Recently, attempts to come 
up with standards for a few of these levels have been 
made at workshops organized by the Discourse Re- 
source Initiative (DRI). The DRI did come up with 
a proposal concerning the dialogue act level (Dis- 
course Resource Initiative, 1997; Allen and Core, 
1997), although there have been serious disagree- 
ments concerning the usefulness of such a 'standard' 
for this level, since it's not clear that it's possible 
to come up with a domain-independent definition of 
dialogue acts. No official recommendation has been 
made in the DRI for the so-called 'coreference' l vel, 
although the DRAMA scheme (Passonneau, 1997) has 
sometimes been discussed for this purpose. 
In this paper we report on the current proposal 
concerning the type of 'coreference' annotation to 
be supported by the MATE workbench, motivating 
our proposal by relation to previous proposals in

2 Annotating for 'Coreference' 
2.1 Problems to be addressed 
The difficulties to be addressed in the case of the 
'coreference' level are of a different nature from those 
that arise in the case of the other annotation task at 
the semantic level considered in MATE, the dialogue 
acts level. 
A very basic problem arising in the case of coref- 
erence is deciding what type of information is being 
annotated, since the term 'coreference' is used to 
indicate different things. The name 'coreference' de- 
rives from the task of 'coreference resolution', one 
of the semantic interpretation tasks adopted in the 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC), a US ini- 
tiative to evaluate systems performing information 
extraction. The coreference annotation scheme used 
in MUC-7, MUCCS (Hirschman, 1997) was devised 
to evaluate the ability of the systems participat- 
ing in the competition to identify which elements 
in the text referred to the same object; hence the 
term 'coreference'. The scheme adopted for anno- 
tating references to landmarks in the MapTask cor- 
pus is also meant to annotate reference in this sense. 
Both the DRAMA scheme and the schemes proposed 
by Lancaster University (Fligelstone, 1992), instead, 
are meant to be use(! to annotate anaphoric infor- 
mation in texts; but coreference is not the same 
as anaphoricity. Two NPS can corefer without ei- 
ther of them being 'anaphoric' in the traditional 
sense -e.g., proper names are not generally consid- 
ered 'anaphoric expressions', yet two proper names 
can obviously corefer, as in (la); and conversely, two 
NPs can be in an anaphoric relation without either 
of them 'referring' to anything, ms in (lb), where one 
of the engines at Elmira doesn't really refer to any 
specific engine yet serves as antecedent of that. (See 
65 
(van Deemter and Kibble, 1999) for further discus- 
sion.) Fortunately for our purposes, coreference in- 
formation can be expressed using the relations used 
to express anaphoric information, which makes it 
possible to develop schemes in which both types 
of information can be encoded, as we will see be- 
low. We will keep referring to the markup level with 
which we are concerned as 'coreference' for consis- 
tency with common use, but the reader should use 
the term with care.

One advantage of the coreference level is that 
notwithstanding the possible source of confusion just 
mentioned, there is much more agreement on the 
underlying catalogue of semantic notions needed to 
characterize this type of information than there is, 
say, for the discourse act level, so that it's pos- 
sible to come up with fairly precise definitions of 
most of the information one would want to anno- 
tate. So, the main problem the designer of such 
a scheme has to confront is the sheer pervasive- 
ness of the phenomenon: almost every word in a 
coherent ext-including quantifiers, nouns, (modal) 
verbs, and adjectives-can be said to be anaphori- 
cally related in some way to what has already been 
introduced in the text, as shown by the following 
examples. This means that, in practice, it will al- 
ways be necessary to restrict somehow the amount 
of anaphoric information to annotate. (See also the 
discussion in (Hirschman, 1997).)

venturous modern architecture, and 
some of the most intriguing attempts 
to deepen the experience of ar_._tt. New- 
house has probably seen more of the 
recently built ar_.&t museums . . . than 
anyone lse. 
A second problem is that we do not know yet what 
can be annotated reliably and what cannot. In their 
reliability study, (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) found a 
fair agreement among annotators (K = .76) con- 
cerning which NPS were anaphoric and which ones 
were not, and about 95% agreement on antecedents 
for those definite descriptions that all subjects idea- 
tiffed as anaphoric; but no agreement on identif.v- 
ing bridging references (K=.24), and often different 
antecedents were indicated for those that all anno- 
tators classified as bridges. 3 As a result, the only 
coding scheme whose reliability has been extensively 
tested is MUCCS. 
2.2 Existing schemes 
The MUCCS scheme (Hirschman, 1997) is the most 
widely used of the existing coreference schemes, and 
also the more modest in scope: it concentrates on 
identity relations between NPs. The nlain l>roblem 
with MUCCS from our point of view is that it was de- 
signed for texts, so it does not provide instructions 
either for dealing with typical problems in dialogue 
such as disfluencies, or for annotating references to 
the visual situation, common e.g., in the MapTask 
corpus and in multimodal applications, and that we 
hypothesize can be reliably annotated (although this 
hyppthesis will have to be verified). Also, it's only 
designed for English, and therefore does not include 
instructions for anaphoric expressions common in 
other European languages and whose relation with 
other discourse ntities could be annotated reliably, 
such as clitics. 
The DRAMA scheme (Passonneau, 1997) does in- 
clude instructions for dealing with some difficult 
problems of markable identification i  dialogues, but 
not for multilingual annotation. DRAMA includes in- 
structions for annotating bridging references (whose 
reliability, however, still has to be ascertained), but 
not for references to the visual situation. The 
scheme proposed by (Bruneseanx and Romary, 1998) 
provides markup elements (based on the TEI scheme) 
to annotate both references to the visual situation 
and discourse deixis, in addition to bridging refer- 
ences; the reliability of this type of annotatiou was- 
n't evaluated. The Lancaster scheme (Fligelstone, 
1992) was also designed for texts, and in certain ways 
is more ambitious than any of the schemes discussed 
3Informal studies conducted in MUC and by the uR1 
confirm this (Discourse Resource Initiative, 1997). The 
participants o these initiatives found reasonable agree- 
ment on the antecedents of anaphoric expressions, but 
poor recall for bridges. These results led to the elimi- 
nation of relations other than IDENT from the r,u)C cod- 
ing scheme for coreference, MUCCS. Those studies also 
suggest hat one way to improve reliability on bridges 
may be to use better tools suggesting relations. Also~ 
using a smaller number of relations may help, but the 
actual number of anaphoric elements annotated was not 
indicated so it's not clear whether this result is actuall.v 
significant.

tating elliptical references. We are not aware of any 
results about the reliability of the scheme. 
3 The MATE Proposal 
3.1 Approach:  A Meta  Scheme and Two 
Instantiations 
It should be clear from the considerations above that 
we do not believe that there is such a thing as a 
universally useful standard for 'coreference' annota- 
tion in dialogues. At the same time, because the 
semantics of anaphora nd coreference is relatively 
well-understood, it is possible to extract from the 
schemes discussed above a fairly short list of options 
available to the designer of a scheme. (This is unlike 
the case of dialogue acts, where different schemes 
are very difficult to compare.) These considerations 
suggested a 'meta-scheme' approach to the goal of 
developing a scheme for the coreference l vel that 
could be useful for different types of applications. 
What this means is that instead of proposing a sin- 
gle scheme, we identified a range of possible types of 
information about 'coreference' one may want to an- 
notate, on the basis of the coding schemes for coref- 
erence discussed above; we evaluated how reliable 
each type of annotation is likely to be; and we spec- 
ified the markup language needed to pursue each 
option. 4
The meta scheme consists of a CORE SCHEME and 
three extensions. The core scheme can be used to 
do the type of annotation that can be done with 
MUCCS (i.e., identity relations between discourse n- 
tities introduced by NPb). The three extensions to 
the core scheme can be used to annotate (i) refer- 
ences to the visual situation, as in the Bruneseaux 
and Romary scheme and in the MapTask scheme for 
annotating references to landmarks; (ii) a more com- 
plex set of relations between entities ('bridges'), as in 
the DRAMA scheme; and (iii) anaphoric relations in- 
volving an extended range of anaphoric expressions 
(such as incorporated clitics) and of antecedents (as 
in discourse deixis). The tool will support he whole 
rmlge of elements and attributes of the meta scheme; 
the task of the designer of a scheme for a particular 
application will be to identify the options of inter- 
est among those supported by the tool, ignoring the 
rest. The documentation for the coreference l vel 
includes, in additions to a discussion of the core 
scheme and the extensions, an example of how to 
extract a scheme from the meta scheme (the exam- 
4The 'meta-scheme' approach was also adopted in 
EAGLES ht~p ://www. ilc. pi. cnr. it~EAGLES~home, html 
and the CES http ://ww~. cs. vassar, edu/CES/. 
pie covers references to the visual situation) as well 
as instructions for using the markup definitions pro- 
vided by the meta scheme to encode according to 
the DRAMA scheme. 
On the assumption that the designer of a scheme 
for dialogues may be interested in annotating both 
'anaphoric' and 'coreferential' information, we ad- 
dressed the problem of the difference between the 
two types of annotation by adopting a position anal- 
ogous to that taken in DRT (Kamp, 1981; Helm, 
1982), whereby coreference information is expressed 
in terms of the same semantic relations used to an- 
notate anaphoric information. This is done by in- 
troducing in the annotation identifiers that stand 
for the 'actual' referents, and expressing reference 
by means of relations between the discourse ntities 
that 'refer' and these identifiers. 
3.2 Markup Language and Assumptions 
About File Organization 
In the rest of the paper we discuss first the Core 
Scheme, then each of the extensions. In this section 
we introduce the markup language and discuss a few 
assumptions underlying annotation using the MATE 
Workbench common to several evels, as well as a 
few assumptions specific to the coreference l vel. 
The markup language in MATE is XML, a simplifi- 
cation of SGML meant o make for easier parsing, but 
the workbench will make this transparent to annota- 
tors (not to annotation scheme designers, of course). 
An assumption common to most levels is the distinc- 
tion between BASE FILE and ANNOTATION FILE. The 
base file contains the information ecessary to anno- 
tate; the results of the annotation for a given level go 
in a separate file containing pointers to elements of 
the base file. For the coreference l vel, for example, 
the base file could be either a file annotated with 
one XML element per word, as in the British Na- 
tional Corpus, or possibly a file containing syntactic 
information; in the latter case, the text elements to 
be annotated could be identified automatically. 
We assume here that the base file is encoded ac- 
cording to the recommendations for the morpho- 
syntactic level of chunks adopted in MATE (Pirrelli 
and Soria, 1999), which specify a type of syntac- 
tic representation that could be produced by ex- 
isting parsers; such parsers might be integrated in 
the workbench. For example, the representation i  
terms of chunks of the sentence John likes Bill would 
be as follows: 
(3) ~h.~l 
<ch idffi"ch_O01" type="N"> 
<potgov id="p O01">John</potgov> 
<Ich> 
67 
<cA id="ch_002" type="V"> 
<potgov id="p_002">likes </potgov> 
</cA> : 
<cA id="ch_003" type="N"> 
<potgov id="p_003">Bill </potgov> 
</cA> 
The result of an annotation at the coreference l vel 
of the file ch.xml (the base file) would be to pro- 
duce a second file containing elements that point to 
cA. xml, as discussed below. 
4 The  Core  Scheme 
m 
The Core Scheme has been designed to annotate the 
subset of all information about 'coreference' that can 
be annotated reliably: that is, information about 
identity relations between discourse ntities explic- 
itly introduced by elements of a text. As in MUCCS, 
it is assumed that annotation will proceed in two 
steps: first agreeing on the markables, then markup 
of anaphoric relations. The main difference 'from the 
MUC scheme is that following the recommendations 
of the Text Encoding Initiative and of Bruneseaux 
and Romary, the distinction between these two steps 
of annotation is mirrored in the Core Scheme by 
a distinction between two elements: <de>,, used to 
mark the parts of text that may be involved in these 
relations, and <link>, used to mark information 
about these relations. 
4.1 Identifying and Mark ing  Discourse '
Entities 
As mentioned above, the main problem with design- 
ing a scheme for anaphora nd coreference is not 
that the relevazlt notions are difficult to define, but 
that you can't annotate verything. Of ghe schemes 
we examined, the Lancaster University is the most 
ambitious, including also ways for annotating vP el- 
lipsis. DRAMA recommends to annotate all noun 
phrases, whether or not they introduce discourse'en- 
tities. MUCCS recommends to annotate also noun 
phrases Occurring in prenominal position in other 
noun phrases, such as Getty in the Getty museum. 
For the Core Scheme we adopted a conservative 
view close to that of DRAMA, and only recommend 
to mark the potential antecedents of anaphoric and 
referential expressions that are realized in the text 
as full NPS; in other words, we did not include in- 
structions for annotating parts of NPS that may en- 
ter in such relations (as in Muccs) and for annotat- 
ing verbal constituents hat enter e.g., in ellipsis (as 
in the Lancaster scheme). If needed, elements for 
marking up verbal constituents are included in one 
of the extensions of the Core Scheme (see below), so 
the MATE Workbench could be used to support his 
type of annotation, as wellprovided that the users 
come up with their own instructions for identifying 
the markables. 
Each markable NP is annotated with a <de> ele- 
ment with an ID attribute. In the underlying XML 
representation, the <de> elements include pointers 
to elements in the base file; e.g., the marl~bles in 
the example in (3)'would be represented as follows: 
(4) .... f. xml 
<de id="de_O01" href="ch.xml#id(ch_O01)"/> 
<de id="de 002 ' href=" ch.xml#id(ch_O03)"/> 
However, this aspect of the representation should be 
transparent to the annotator, who will only be ('on- 
cerned with marking <de> elements and assigning 
them an ID. SO in what follows, also to make the 
notation more readable, we will represent markup 
using a simpler notation without HREF pointers, as 
in the following examples: 
(5) <de ID="de_Ol">we</de>'re gonna take 
<de ID="de_OT">the engine E3</de> 
and shove <de ID="de_08"> it </de> over 
to <de ID="de_O2">Corning</de>, 
hook <de ID="de_09"> it </de> up to 
<de ID="de_O3">the tanker car</de>... 
(6) . 197 F: r~nh /Donc qu'est ce que vous 
allez garder en fair (?) + / 
198 M: l<de ID="de_96">la longueur du 
<de ID="de_97">tube</de></de> 
et <de ID="de_98"> les ailerons </de> 
199 D:<de ID="de_99"> les ailerons </de> 
200 F: Done <de ID="de_lO0"> les ailerons 
</de> vous m~avez dit. 
It is assumed that in most cases (at least, when the 
base file is annotated with syntactic information) 
markables will be automatically identified by means 
of search patterns formulated in terms of the MATE 
query language (Held and Mengel, 1999); the main 
role of the annotator would be to correct possible 
problems. This suggests that the markables would 
be mostly identified on purely structural grounds. 
The instructions for identifying markables do include 
however a discussion of several cases in wlfich the de- 
signers of a scheme may decide not to mark a text 
element as <de> even if syntactically it counts as a 
NP: examples are NPS in predicative position, such as 
a policeman in John is a policeman 5, and repeated 
NPs in the case of disfluencies, as in the following 
example: 
(7) 193 F: Doric qu'est ce qui / 
qu'est ce qui serait commun a 
5Note that the pronoun he in the contimlation Hc 
works for the 27th district would not be con,~idered 
ambiguous. 
68 
<de>ces deux fusees</de>. 
<de>Ces deux fusees</de> ont / 
194 D: c'est qu'elles ont / 
<de>elles</de> ont la meme / 
elles / elles / routes les / 
tousles ailerons 
(in cases like this, DRAMA recommends to mark up 
all repetitions of ells, although again, they do not 
create ambiguity). The instructions for the Core 
Scheme include a fairly extensive discussion of which 
text constituents count as NPS, whichincorporates 
examples from MUCCS and DRAMA as well as from 
(Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973). 
An issue not considered either in MUCCS or in 
DRAMA is what to do when a discourse entity is 
not introduced by a single contiguous prase, but by 
utterances interrupted by disfluencies or comments, 
as in (8), where the utterance of the diamond mine 
is interrupted by an acknowledgment from the fol- 
lower: 
(8) GIVER: curving, just curving round 
the diamond 
FOLLOWER: uh-huh 
GIVER: mine . . . . . .  uh-huh 
We believe this problem should be addressed at the 
parsing level by providing ways of representing non- 
contiguous yntactic elements, as done in the repre- 
sentation for the morpho-syntactic level proposed in 
MATE. The chunk-level representation f the exam- 
ple above is shown in (9), whereas the representation 
at the coref level is shown in (10). 
(9) ~h.,.l: 
GIVER: Curving, just curving round 
<ch ID="ch.66" next="ch_68">the dimaond</ch > 
FOLLOWER: <?h ID~"ch_67">uh-huh </ch> 
GIVER: <ch ID="ch_68" prev="ch_66"> 
mine </oh >. 
<ch ID="?h_69"> ..... uh-huh</ch> 
(I0) .... ~.,,i: 
<de ID="DE.01" 
hrefB"ah, xml$id (ch_66).. id (?h_68) "/> 
The other addition to the instructions given in 
MUCCS and DRAMA are instructions for marking up 
clitics and empty elements, common in Italian and 
Spanish. Markup elements for marking incorporated 
clitics (such as daselo in (11) and empty elements are 
discussed below; clitics realized as distinct particles 
(such as la in (11) are also marked as <de>s, as fol- 
h)ws. 
(II) ~ir~. te doy <de ID="de_I67"> esZe libro </de> 
Conoces a <de ID="de.168"> mi suegra?</de> 
Pues daselo ?uando 
<de IDw"de_170"> la </de> yeas. 
4.2 Links 
The subset of 'coreference' information which has 
been shown most clearly to be markable in a reli- 
able way coincides with the information that can 
be annotated with the MUCCS scheme: identity rela- 
tions between discourse ntities explicitly introduced 
in the text by nominal phrases. In the core scheme, 
this is the only information that can be annotated. 
Whereas identity relations are represented in 
MUCCS and DRAMA by means of attributes on el- 
ements that correspond to the <de> element used 
in the MATE scheme, we adopted a notation de- 
rived from the <link> mechanism used in the 
TEl for linking any text element and adopted by 
Bruneseaux and Ronmry for representing anaphoric 
information. 6 <link> elements have two attributes: 
a HREF pointer to the <de> element hat stands in an 
anaphoric relation with an antecedent, and a TYPE 
attribute specifying the relation (which in the case 
of the Core Scheme can only be IDENT). <link> ele- 
ments contain then one or more <anchor> elements, 
with a single <href> pointer to the antecedent. So 
for example, the anaphoric relations in (5) and (6) 
would be annotated as follows: 
(12). coref.xml 
<de ID="de_Ol">we</de>'re gonna take 
<de ID="de_07"> the engine E3 </de> 
and shove <de ID="de_08"> it </de> over 
to <de ID="de_O2">Corning</de>, 
hook <de ID="de_09"> it </de> up to 
<de ID="de_O3">the tanker car</de>... 
<link href=" corer, xml#id (de_07)"

<anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_08)"/> 
</link> 
<link href="coref, xml#id (de_08)" 
type =''ident "> 
<anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_09)"/> 
</link> 
(13) coref.xml: 
197 F: mmh /Donc  qu'est ce que vous

<anchor href="coref.xml#id(de-99)"/> 
</link> 
<link href="coref ? xJnl#id (de_99)" 
type="ident"> 
<anchor href="coref.xml#id(de-lO0)"/> 
6The slightly modified representation f <link>s ill 
our proposal was adopted for technical reasons. 
69 
</ l ink> 
In MUCCS, the annotator is free to choose any of the 
two elements in an identity relation as 'anaphor', be- 
cause identity is symmetric. As the intention is to 
use <link> elements to also annotate non-symmetric 
relations such as those found in bridging cases, we 
recommend to always have the HREF pointer in the 
<link> element point to the anaphor, and the HREF 
pointer in the <anchor> to the antecedent. (In gen- 
eral, the annotator will still be able to exploit the 
transitivity property of identity and choose any an- 
tecedent, although in particular cases this may not 
be a good idea either.) 
The reason why <link> elements may have more 
than one <anchor> element is to annotate ambigui- 
ties, which are very common in spoken dialogue. In 
case more than one <de> element appears to be an 
equally likely antecedent of an anaphoric expression, 
each of the possibilities hould be marked by means 
of a separate <anchor> element. In (14a), for exam- 
ple, the pronun it in 15.16 could refer equally well 
to engine E3 or the tanker car. Both antecedents 
should be annotated, as shown in (14b). 
(14) a.  15.12 : we're gonna take the engine E3 
15.13 : and shove it over to Coming  
15.14 : hook it up to the tanker car

15.14 : hook <de ID="de_lT">it</de> up to

15.15 : _and_ 
15.16

<link href="coref, xml#id (de_f6)" type="ident"> 
<anchor href='coref .xml#id (de_f5)"/> 
</link>

<anchor href="coref, xml#id (de_lT) "/> 
<anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_18)"/> 
</link> 
As in the case of DRAMA, we recommend to mark up 
all ambiguities, and not annotate 'vague' or 'ambi- 
ent' references.

In inultimodal dialogues it is possible to refer to ob- 
jects which have not been previously introduced, but 
are 'accessible' by virtue of being part of the vi- 
sual situation: examples are objects on the screen 
in the case of multimodal applications (Bruneseaux 
and Romary, 1998) and references to landmarks in 
the map in the MAPTASK corpus. The first proposed 
extension to the Core Scheme consists of a new set of 
elements introduced in order to annotate references 
to the visual situation. 
We adopted for this purpose a variant of the 
<universe> mechanism used in the Bruneseaux- 
Romary scheme. The idea is to assign an ID to each 
object in the visual situation that can be referred 
to, and then represent references to these objects 
by means of the same <link> mechanism used for 
anaphoric relations in the Core Scheme. For each 
object in the visual situation, a <ue> element gets 
created; the <ue> elements are then grouped in a 
<universe> element, as follows: 
(15) ?ore~.,mi: 
<universe ID="UI"> 
<ue ID="uel"> Diamond mine </ue> 
<ue ID="ue2"> Graveyard </ueY 
<ue ID="ue3"> Fast rulLning creek </ue> 
<ue ID="ue4"> Feat flowing river </ue> 
<ue ID="ueS"> Canoes </ue> 
</universe> 
FOLLOWER: Uh-huh. Curve round. To your right. 
GIVER: IFn-huh. 
FOLLOWER: Right .... Right underneath 
<de ID="de50"> the diamond mine. </de> 
Where do I stop. 
GIVER: Well ....... Do. Have you got  
de ID="de51"> a graveyard?</de> 
Sort of in the middle of the page?... 
On on a level to 
<de ID="de52"> the c--.., er dlamond 
mine. </de> 
<link href="coref.xml#id(deSO)" type="ident"> 
<anchor href ="coref. xml#id (ue I) "/> 
<anchor href="coref, xml#id (de_ 18) "/> 
</link) 
<link href="coref.xml#id(de51)" type="ident"> 
<anchor href="coref, xml#id (ue2) "/> 
<anchor href=" coref, xml#id (de_18) "/> 
</link> 
<link href="coref.xml#id(de52)" type="ident"> 
<anchor href="coref.xml#id(ue3) "/> 
<anchor href="coref, xml#id (de_18) "/> 
</link> 
Having a single universe is sufficient in cases when 
there is a single case of objects, but not iu domains 
like the MapTask, where the two participants to 
the conversation have slightly different maps. The 
<universe> mechanism has been designed to ham 
dle this type of situations, as well. hi these cases. 
it is suggested that three universes be c,'eated: ore, 
with ID="COMMON" containing all objects shared l)~,- 
tween the visual situations, and then one univ(,rs(, 
for each conversational participant containing the 
elements known only to that participant. This will 
ensure that the shared elements receive a unique ID. 
<universe> elements have an optional MODIFIES at- 
tribute that can be used to encode the information 
that a given universe is an extension of another uni- 
70 
verse; e.g., in the case just discussed, tile universe 
of each participant could be given a value for the 
MODIFIES= "COMMON". 
In (161)) we see how the situation in (16a) could 
be encoded. Three universes are defined; COMMON 
contains a gold mine, whereas the GIVER_UNIVERSE 
also contains a diamond mine, which isn't in the 
follower's universe. As a result, the follower mistak- 
euly believes that the gold mine and the dianmnd 
mine are the same. This example also illustrates how 
these misunderstandings could be encoded by ineans 
of another optional extension to the link mecha- 
nism specified in the Core Scheme: the attribute 
WH0-BELIEVES, whose values would be identifiers for 
the two participants in the conversation (G and F in 
this case).

We don't know of any reliability study for this 
type of references, but experience with MapTask 
suggests that it call be done reliably. We are cur- 
rently doing a test of the reliability of this extension 
in two languages (Italian and English) and will re- 
port, at tile Workshop. 
6 . Mark ing  non-nomina l  e lements  
Even if we only consider anaphorie relations inwflv- 
ing nominal elenients, there ark at least two situa- 
tions in which an aimotator may wish to mark an 
anaphoric relation that also involves other types of 
constituents. The first is the case, already men- 
tioned in Section 4, ill which we have a relation that 
would fall for all purposes under tile Core Scheme, 
except that the anaphoric elemeut is either iuwx- 
pressed or incorporated in tile w'rb. Tile second sit- 
uation are tile ca.ses of so-called I)ISCOURSE DI,'IXIS 
(Webber, 1991), when tile anWcedent of n nonfimd 
expression is an ahstract Object such as an event or 
prol)osition introduced in the discourse somewhat 
indirectly by sentences. (DJtAMA allows for such r(~- 
lations to be marked.) 
The second extension to the Core ScheIne was de- 
veloped to give annotators tools to mark these types 
of aimphoric relations. The solution we propose is 
to use the <seg> element introduced in tile TEl to 
mark up arbitrary pieces of text; <seg> elements ar(' 
given an ID which can then be used in <link> ,~h,- 
mcnts just like for other anaphuric relations. (The 
<seg> elenmnt couhl also be use(l to extend tile recta 
s(:heme to cover amq)tmri(: relations betw(:en non- 
nominal elements, such as vp ellil)sis.) 
6.1 Using SEG to mark  up empty  and 
incorporated  const i tuents  
In Italian, Spanish and Inany other languages, (:at- 
tain noininal constituents may not be realized; this is 
especially conunoil for nominals in subject position. 
These nonlinals are i)resent in annotations l)ro(lu('(~(l 
71 
by hand (e.g., in the Penn Treebank), but the parsers 
used for parsing spoken dialogues tend not to pro- 
duce representations containing empty constituents 
in this case. In case these nominals are not rep- 
resented in the base level, we recommend to mark 
the verb with a <seg> element, and then code the 
anaphoric relation as usual by means of <link> ele- 
ments, as follows: 
(17) core f .xml :  
A: Dov'e' <de ID="de_157">Giann i?</de  > 
\[Where is Gianni? \ ]  
B: <seg type="pred"  ID="seg_158 >e' 
andato a mang iare  </seg> 
\[. went to have lunch\] 
<l ink hre f="core f  .xml#id(seg_158)"  
type= "ident''> 
<anchor  hre f="core f  .xml#id(de_157)  "/> 
</ l ink> 
The reader will have noticed that this representation 
can only be used without loss of information when 
there is at most one empty elements; this is true for 
Italian, but not for Japanese or Portuguese. If more 
precision needed, the annotator should the** define 
more specific identity relations also specifying which 
empty argument of the verb enters in the anaphoric 
relation: SUBJ-IDENT, 0BJ-IDENT~ etc. These rela- 
tions could then used instead of IDENT to specify the 
value of the TYPE attribute of the <link> element. 
A second case in which an argument is not real- 
ized by means of a nominal is in the case of incor- 
porated clitics, such as daselo in (11). In this case, 
again, we recommend marking the verb by way of 
a <seg> element when the parser doesn't produce 
a morphologically decomposed representation, and 
then encoding the anaphoric relations in which the 
clitics are involved by means of either a single IDENT 
relation or by means of more fine-grained relations 
such as SUBJ-IDENT or 0BJ-IDENT.

</link> 
Provided that the <seg> elements are identified ur- 
ing the first pass of markable identification, encod- 
ing this information should not be any harder than 
in the case of the Core Scheme. The real question for 
this type of annotation is which empty elements to 
annotate -e.g., in addition to 'small pro' elements 
such as those discussed above, the amlotator may 
also decide to annotate 'big PRO' elements that ac- 
cording to some syntactic theories occupy the sub- 
ject position of infinitival clauses. 
6.2 Using SEG to mark  the antecedents  of 
d iscourse deixis 
Abstract objects such as events, actions and propo- 
sitions can all serve as antecedents of anaphoric ex- 
pressions. We are not aware of any reliability results 
for this type of annotation, but the <seg> element 
can be used to identify the antecedents in this type 
of anaphora. If desired, the annotator could use a 
second attribute TYPE to specify the type of object 
introduced by the <seg> element; TYPE would have 
values EVENT, PROP and ACTION.

These examples also ilustrate some of the problems 
to be addressed when designing a reliable annotation 
scheme for this phenomenon: these include deciding 
what part of the text counts as antecedent as well as 
deciding which type of object the antecedent is (see, 
e.g., (21)). 
7 Br idg ing  References  
DRAMA also allows annotators to encode certain 
types of eRIDOING REFERENCES (Clark, 1977): 
these are anaphoric expressions that denote objects 
that have not yet been introduced in the discourse, 
but that are related to an entity already introduced 
in the text by relations other than identity? An ex- 
ample is the indicators in: 
(22) John has bought a new car. The indicators 
use the latest laser technology. 
We are able to interpret the description the indica- 
tors because we know that indicators are parts of 
cars. The set of relations that may hold between 
a bridging reference and its 'antecedent' or 'anchor' 
is rather wide; an extensive survey of the existing 
classifications can be found in (Vieira, 1998). 
The Extended Relations Scheme is designed for 
those who wish to mark up this more general 
anaphoric relations. It uses the same elements as 
the Core Scheme, but more values are allowed for the 
TYPE attribute of the <link> element besides imple 
IDENT. The set of relations allowed by the scheme de- 
rives from the analysis of Vieira and includes most 
of the bridging relations in DRAMA (MEMBER, SUBSET, 
PART, CAUSE, POSS and ARG). For example, we see in 
(23) how the elements of the Extended Relations 
Scheme can be used to encode a subset relation be- 
tween lee modeles de fusees and lee fusees qui ont 
bien vole'. 
(23)  a. F: Alors aonc / yeas avez / i c i  / 
LES MODELES DE FUSEES /

mettre d'accord sur tm classement

<link href=" corer ,  xml#id (de_90)" 
type="subset " > 
<anchor hre f - "core f ,  xml#id(de_88)"/> 
</l ink> 
As the poor reliability scores which have been ob- 
tained by (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) for this kind of 
scheme indicate, once one moves beyond the ident 
relation, it can be difficult to decide how to classify 
the link between two elements. We tried to alleviate 
this problem by adopting the TEl technique of spec- 
ifying 'subtypes' of links: in those cases in which 
it may be difficult to identify precisely the type of 
relation that exists between two entities, we intro- 
duced a more general relation to be used as type of 
a link, as well as more specific relations to be used 
as values of the SUBTYPE attribute in those cases in 
which this additional specification is possible. We 
used this technique for two types of relations: pos- 
session relations (which include generic attribution, 
true possession and part as subtypes) and event re- 
lations (which include relations such as cause and 
'role' as subparts). The following example illustrates 
how type and subtype attributes can be used to en- 
code possession relations at the desired level of pre- 
cision, as well as why sometimes it may be difficult 
to decide which relation holds between two discourse 
entities.

<link href="coref ,  xml#id (de_92)" 
type="poss " subtype="attr  " > 
<anchor href="coref.xnl#id(de.93)"/> 
</link> 
In the documentation we specify additional relations 
and further distinctions that an annotator may wish 
to make, including ways to annotate the function- 
value relations discussed in MUCCS. 
73 
The basic problem to be solved when trying to 
do this type of annotation is to come up with in- 
structions that will ensure that annotators recognize 
bridging references. As a preliminary proposal, we 
suggest hat annotators try first to identi~" an an- 
tecedent which is identical with the mmphor; if that 
fails, they should try first to find a discourse ntity 
with which the anaphor stands in one of the set re- 
lations, then one with which it stands in one of the 
generalized possession relations.

Work  
So far, we have used to scheme to annotate a TRAINS 
dialogue, a MAPTASK dialogue, and a dialogue from 
the microfusees corpus collected by LOmA. We are 
currently running a reliability study of the exten- 
sion dealing with references to the visual situation, 
while waiting for the preliminary release of the MATE 
workbench to study the more complex features of 
the scheme. This will also involve trying to extract 
a coding book from the manual by fixing up some 
parameters. As the preliminary release of the MATE 
workbench is planned for May, we may be able to 
report some results already at the ACL meeting.
