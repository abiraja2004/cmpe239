Abstract
This paper proposes a new framework for
a spoken dialogue system based on dia-
logue examples between human subjects
and the Wizard of OZ (WOZ) system. Us-
ing this framework and a model of infor-
mation retrieval dialogue, a spoken dia-
logue system for retrieving shop informa-
tion while driving in a car has been de-
signed. The system refers to the dialogue
examples to find an example that is suit-
able for generating a query or a reply. The
authors have also constructed a large-scale
dialogue database using a WOZ system,
which enables efficient collection of dia-
logue examples.
1 Introduction
Against the background of ever-increasing comput-
ing power, techniques for constructing spoken di-
alogue systems using large-scale speech and text
corpora have become the target of much research
(Levin et al, 1998; Young, 2002). In prior re-
search, the authors have proposed a spoken-dialogue
control technique using dialogue examples with the
aim of performing flexible dialogue control dur-
ing information-retrieval dialogue and of achieving
speech understanding robust against speech recog-
nition errors (Murao et al, 2001). This technique
uses input speech data and supplementary informa-
tion corresponding to input speech such as retrieval
formulas (queries) to form ?examples? that decide
system action. A system using this technique can-
not run effectively, however, without a large volume
of example data. Traditionally, though, collecting
human-to-human dialogue data and manually pro-
viding such supplementary information for each in-
stance of input speech has required considerable la-
bor.
In this paper, we address this problem and pro-
pose a new technique for constructing an example-
based dialogue system using, as example data, the
dialogue performed between a human subject and a
pseudo-spoken-dialogue system based on the Wiz-
ard of OZ (WOZ) scheme. We also describe a
specific spoken dialogue system for information re-
trieval that we constructed using this technique.
2 Dialogue Processing Based on Examples
We first provide an overview of example-based dia-
logue processing that we previously proposed (Mu-
rao et al, 2001).
2.1 Model of information retrieval dialogue
Given a scenario in which a human operator
searches an information database and returns infor-
mation to a user, dialog between the operator and
user can be modeled as shown in Fig. 1. The ele-
ments of this model are described below.
1. Request The user tells the operator the con-
tents of an inquiry and demands reference.
2. Retrieval The operator receiving the user?s re-
quest generates a query after referencing do-
main knowledge and current dialogue context

and then processes the query indirectly by ma-
nipulating a search tool such as an ordinary
computer.
3. Search results The search tool generates
search results.
4. Reply The operator returns a reply to the user
based on search results and dialogue context.
Setting up information flow in this way allows
us to view operator behavior in the following way.
Specifically, the operator in Fig. 1 makes two deci-
sions in the process of advancing dialog.
Decision 1: Generate a query after listening to user
speech
Decision 2: Generate a reply after receiving search
results
Here, an experienced operator would use more
than just the superficial information obtained from
user speech. To generate a query or reply that
best suits the user?s need at that time, the opera-
tor would also make use of domain knowledge, di-
alogue context, and the search results themselves.
In other words, this kind of dialogue processing can
be viewed as a mapping operation from input infor-
mation such as user speech and domain knowledge
to output information such as a query. With this in
mind, we considered whether a ?decision? to guide
such dialogue could be automatically performed by
referring to actual examples of behavior manifested
by an experienced human operator. In short, we de-
cided to store a large volume of dialogue examples,
i.e., mapping information, and to determine output
information for certain input information on the ba-
sis of mapping information stored in similar dia-
logue examples.
2.2 Generation of queries and replies based on
examples
2.2.1 Structure of example data
The two ?decisions? performed during the time of
information retrieval dialogue between the user and
operator can be expressed as a mapping between the
following input and output information.
? Input/output information in the decision for
generating a query:
Input User speech and dialogue context
Output Query
? Input/output information in the decision for
generating a reply:
Input User speech, dialogue context, and
search results
Output Reply
It is therefore sufficient to save those items that
cover such input and output information. Specifi-
cally, a large number of example data can be col-
lected using the following information as elements
to construct an example database.
1. Text of user speech
2. Query
3. Reply text
4. Search results
5. Dialogue context (past speech, grounding in-
formation, conversational objects , etc.)
The following describes the procedure for gener-
ating a query or reply with respect to input speech
by referencing an example database.
2.2.2 Query generation process
From among the examples in the example
database, the system extracts the one most similar
to the input speech and the dialogue context at that
time. It then adjusts the query in that example to fit
the input speech and generates a new query.
2.2.3 Reply generation process
The system performs a search based on the gen-
erated query and receives search results. It then ex-
tracts the most similar example from the example
database with respect to input speech, the dialogue
context at that time, and the search results. Finally,
the system adjusts the reply in that example to fit the
current conditions and generates a new reply.
2.3 Problem points
Operating a dialogue system based on dialogue
examples requires the construction of an example
database as described above. Constructing a large-
scale example database, moreover, requires a large
volume of dialogue text in which supplementary in-
formation such as queries and search results has
been provided with respect to input speech.
Up to now, we have been constructing an exam-
ple database by first collecting human-to-human di-
alogue and converting speech to text and then as-
signing queries, search results, and the like to each
instance of input speech. This, however, is a labori-
ous process. In addition, example data constructed
on the basis of human-to-human dialogue data may
have features different from those of human-to-
dialogue-system dialogue data. In other words, we
cannot call the above approach an optimal method
for constructing example data.
3 Construction of an Example Database
using the WOZ System
We propose the Wizard of OZ (WOZ) system as
one means of efficiently collecting dialogue data
that includes supplementary information attached to
speech. Carrying on a dialogue using WOZ makes
it possible to collect the information needed for
constructing an example database while collecting
speech data.
3.1 WOZ system
When carrying on a dialogue using the WOZ sys-
tem, the user feels that he or she is talking to a com-
pletely mechanical system despite the fact that a hu-
man being is actually being used for some of the
elements making up the dialogue system. Collect-
ing dialogue data by WOZ should therefore result in

data that is closer to dialogue that would occur be-
tween a human and a machine.
Collecting spoken dialogue data using the WOZ
system has actually been performed a number of
times in the past (MADCOW, 1992; Bertenstam et
al., 1995; Life et al, 1996; Eskenazi et al, 1999;
San-Segundo et al, 2001; Lemmela and Boda, 2002;
Yoma et al, 2002). The objective of those stud-
ies, however, was to collect, analyze, and evaluate
dialogue data between people and artificial objects,
and in many cases, only one of the artificial-object?s
functions was taken over by a human, for example,
the speech recognition function.
Our study, however, goes further than the above.
In particular, we create special software (called
WOZ software) that allows a human being to per-
form the functions of interpreting user speech, gen-
erating queries and executing searches, and generat-
ing replies. We then propose a framework that en-
ables the operator (wizard) to carry on a dialogue
with the user while operating this WOZ software so
that obtained data can be used later to perform di-
rect control of a dialogue system. Specifically, we
configure a pseudo-spoken-dialogue system (WOZ)
consisting of WOZ software and an operator, hold
information retrieval dialogue between this system
and human subjects, and save the queries ,search re-
sults and reply statements generated at this time as
log information. We then use this log information
and text-converted speech to construct an example
database that can be used for dialogue control.

Figure 4: An example of display of Wizard of OZ system (2): Reply generation part
the WOZ software, which was created using the
C++ language, runs on a personal computer under
Windows2000. It consists of a screen for generat-
ing queries (query part) and a screen for generating
replies (reply part). Figures 3 and 4 show sample
screens of these parts. This GUI adopts a touch-
panel system to facilitate operations ? an operator
only has to touch a button on one of these screens
to generate a query, search an information database,
generate a reply, or output synthesized speech.
WOZ software must feature high operability to
achieve natural dialogue between the WOZ system
and a human user. When designing WOZ software
on the basis of a human-to-human dialogue corpus
that we previously collected, we used the following
techniques to enable the system to operate in real
time while carrying on a dialogue with the user.
First, the query part arranges keywords in a tree
structure by search type so that appropriate key-
words can be selected at a touch to generate a query
and retrieve information quickly 1 . Search results
are displayed at the bottom of the screen in list form.
Second, the reply part displays text-input buttons
for generating replies and a list of search results.
The text-input buttons correspond to words, phrases,
and short standard sentences, and pushing them in

currently not defined for the sake of simplicity in software op-
eration.
?Hungry, but not enough time.
?You want to eat Chineese noodle.
?Search Japanese food restaurant.
Figure 5: Examples of prompting panels
an appropriate order generates a reply in text form.
The arrangement of these text-input buttons on the
screen is based on connection frequency between
text elements (reply-statement bigram) as previously
determined from the human-to-human dialogue cor-
pus mentioned above. In other words, each text-
input button represents a text entry having the high-
est frequency of following the immediately previous
text entry to the left, which makes for quick genera-
tion of a reply. Furthermore, to enable quick input,
the section of the screen displaying the search results
has been designed so that the name portion of each
result can be touched directly and automatically in-
cluded in the reply. The generated reply in text form
is finally output in voice form via the speech synthe-
sis section of the system.
Switching back and forth between the query and
reply parts can be performed as needed using a
switch button. The reply part also includes but-
tons for instantly generating words and short phrases
of confirmation and encouragement (e.g., ?yes,? ?I
see?) while the user is speaking to create as natural
a dialogue as possible.
3.3 Collecting dialogue data by the WOZ
system
We targeted shop-information retrieval while driv-
ing a car as an information-retrieval application
based on spoken dialogue, and collected dialogue
data between the WOZ system and human subjects
(Kawaguchi et al, 2002). This data was collected
within an automobile driven by subjects each of
whom acted as a user searching for information. A
personal computer running the WOZ software was
placed in the automobile with the ?wizard? sitting
in the back seat. All spoken dialogue was recorded
using another personal computer.
Data collection was performed according to the
following procedure for a duration of about five min-
Table 1: Collected WOZ data

utes per subject.
? A prompting panel such as shown in Fig. 5 is
presented to the subject.
? The subject converses freely with WOZ based
on the prompting panel shown.
The wizard operates the WOZ system while lis-
tening to the subject, that is, the wizard performs an
appropriate search and returns a reply using speech
synthesis 2 .
Table 1 shows the scale of collected data.
3.4 Constructing an example database using
WOZ log information
WOZ software was designed to output detailed log
information. This information consists mainly of
the following items. All log information is recorded
with time stamps.
? Speaker ID (input by the wizard when initiating
a dialogue)
? Query generated for the input speech in ques-
tion
? Search results returned for the generated query
(number of hits and shop IDs)
? Text of reply generated by the operator (wiz-
ard)
A saved WOZ log can be used to efficiently con-
struct an example database by the following proce-
dure. To begin with, a written record of user speech
is made based on the voice recording of spoken di-
alog with time information added. Next, based on
2The wizard generates queries, performs searches, and gen-
erates replies to the extent possible for speech to which defined
queries can be applied. If a query cannot be generated, the wiz-
ard will not keep trying and will generate only an appropriate
response.

ware, a correspondence is established between user
speech and queries and between search results and

We constructed an example database using a por-
tion of dialogue data collected in the above manner.
Table 2 summarizes the data used for this purpose.
Query and search-result correspondences were es-
tablished for about 20% of all user speech excluding
speech outside of the task in question and speech
outside of query specifications.
4 Spoken Dialogue System using Dialogue
Examples
We here describe a dialogue system that runs using
the example database that we constructed (see (Mu-
rao et al, 2001) for details). The task is to search for
shop information while inside an automobile. This
system was implemented using the C++ language
under Windows2000. Figure 6 shows a screen shot
of this example-based dialogue system.
4.1 System configuration
The following describes the components of this sys-
tem with reference to Fig. 7.
Dialogue example database (DEDB): Consists of
data constructed from dialogue text and log in-
formation output from WOZ software. Dia-
logue text is subjected to morphological anal-
ysis 3, and words essential to advancing the di-
alogue (e.g., shop name, facility name, food
name) are assigned word class tags based on
classes given to these words beforehand ac-
cording to meaning.
Word Class Database (WCDB): Consists of
words essential to the task in question and
classes given to them according to meaning.
Word classes are determined empirically based
on dialogue within the dialogue corpus.
Shop Information Database (SIDB): Consists of
a collection of information on about 800 restau-
rants and shops in Nagoya, the same as that
used in the WOZ system.
Speech Recognition: Uses ?Japanese Dictation
Toolkit(Kawahara et al, 2000)?. The lan-
guage model was created from the previously
collected human-to-human dialogue corpus.

4.2 Operation
The following describes system operation (see Fig.
8 for a specific operation example).
Step 1: Extracting similar example for query
For a speech recognition result, the system
extracts the most similar example from the
DEDB. The robustness of the similarity cal-
culation between the input utterance and the
utterance in the DEDB should be considered
against the speech recognition error. Therefore,
a keyword matching method using the word
class information is adopted. For a speech
recognition result combined with a morpholog-
ical analysis result, independent words and the
Input:   Etto, spaghetti no omise ni ikitai na.
            (I'd like to go to a spaghetti restaurant.)

Figure 8: Example of query and reply generation
important words to which the word class tags
are assigned according to the information in
the WCDB are regarded as the keywords, and
their similarity is calculated as follows. For
each transcription of a user?s utterances in the
DEDB, the number of matched words and the
number of important words which belong to
the same word class are accumulated with the
correspondent weight and the result is treated
as the similarity. The utterance which marks
the highest similarity is regarded as the most
similar one.
Step2: Query Modification The query for the ex-
tracted example is modified with reference to
the input utterance. The modification is per-
formed by replacing the keywords in the refer-
ence query using word class information.
Step 3: Search The SIDB is searched by using the
modified query and a search result is obtained.
Step 4: Extracting similar example for reply
The system extracts the most similar example
from the DEDB, by taking account of not only
the similarity between the input utterance and
the utterance in examples but also that between
the number of items in the search result and
that in the examples. Here, a total similarity
score is computed by performing a weighted
summation of two values: the utterance sim-
ilarity score and the search-results similarity
score obtained from the difference between
the number of search results in an example
and that obtained in Step 3. The search-results
similarity score is computed as follows.
When the number of search results by mod-
ified query is 0: Give the highest score to
examples in the example database with 0 num-
ber of search results and the lowest score to all
other examples.
When the number of search results by mod-
ified query is 1 or more: Give the high-
est score to examples in the example database
with the same number of search results and an
increasingly lower score as difference in the
number of search results becomes larger (use
heuristics).
For example, if not even one search result could
be obtained by the modified query, examples in
the example database with not even one search
result constitute a match.
Step 5: Reply Modification The reply statement
for the extracted example is modified with ref-
erence to the input utterance. The modification
is performed by replacing the words in the ref-
erence reply statement by using word class in-
formation. Then a speech synthesis module is
used to produce a reply speech.
4.3 Adding, modification, and deletion of
example data
This system allows example data to be added, mod-
ified, and deleted. When a failed operation occurs
while carrying on a dialogue, for example, buttons
located at the bottom of the screen can be used to
modify existing example data, add new examples,
and delete unnecessary examples.
5 Conclusion
This paper has proposed an efficient technique for
collecting example data using the Wizard of OZ
(WOZ) system for the purpose of guiding spoken di-
alogue using dialogue examples. This technique has
the following effects.
? Knowledge buried in the WOZ system log
(conversions from input speech to query and
reply, etc.) can be used as dialogue system
knowledge.
? Because dialogue is collected using the WOZ
system, the examples so collected are close to
dialogue that would occur in an environment
with an actual dialogue system. In other words,
dialogue examples can be collected under con-
ditions close to human-to-machine dialogue.
? The labor involved in recording speech neces-
sary for construction of an example database
can be reduced.
In future research, we plan to evaluate dialogue-
processing performance and context processing us-
ing example databases constructed with the WOZ
system.
