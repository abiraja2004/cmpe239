Abstract 
A desired property of a measure of 
connective strength in bigrams is that 
the measure should be insensitive to 
corpus size. This paper investigates 
the stability of three different measures 
over text genres and expansion of the 
corpus. The measures are (1) the 
commonly used mutual information, 
(2) the difference in mutual informa- 
tion, and (3) raw occurrence. Mutual 
information is further compared to 
using knowledge about genres to re- 
move overlap between genres. This 
last approach considers the difference 
between two products of the same 
process (human text-generation) con- 
strained by different genres. The can- 
cellation of overlap seems to provide 
the most specific word pairs for each 
genre. 
1 Introduction 
Statistical methods have been used to find co- 
hesion between local items of language (such 
as phonemes, morphemes, or words). Early 
work (Stolz, 1965; Zellig, 1955) was inspired 
by the advances in information science 
(Shannon, 1951; Shannon & Weaver, 1963). 
The research benefited from the possibility to 
store huge amounts of information i  compu- 
ter systems, and the optimism could be 
overwhelming when the problems were 
simplified and thought mostly restricted by 
the size of the corpus. In this paper the stabi- 
lity of some bigram measures will be investi- 
gated. Bigrams are items (i.e. word forms) 
that occur frequently together in a specific or- 
der. The meanings of bigrams are not discus- 
sed since there is no meaning outside of a 
context. Co-occurrence is still interesting be- 
cause bigrams occur non-randomly, someti- 
mes to such an extent hat we discern some 
structure beyond co-occurrence. The reason 
why it should be so is probably that part of 
the use of words is reflected by the company 
that words keep. 
Researchers (Church & Hanks, 1990; Kita 
& al., 1994, inter al.) have noted that mutual 
information tends to be insensitive to high 
fi'equency patterns, and unstable for low fre- 
quency patterns. Johansson (1994) compared 
another measure, the difference in mutual in- 
formation (Ag), of collocational strength with 
mutual information (g). That measure ranked 
high frequency bigrams higher than other bi- 
grams if the order was consistent, whereas 
mutual information tended to pick out combi- 
nations of low frequency items. Since low 
frequency items carry more specific informa- 
tion such bigrams give an illusion of semantic 
content. It is usually this semantic illusion that 
we are interested in, but what says that "of 
the" or "in a" are worse bigrams than "wood- 
en spades" or "various pretexts". Johansson 
proposed the test of finding some of the 
characters in the children's tory "Alice in 
Wonderland", and showed that a 'new' 
measure was to some degree "better" than 
mutual information. Unfortunately, some of 
that result was based on the fact that mutual 
information is very sensitive to low frequency 
items. 
2 Definitions 
2.1 Mutual information 
In the following p(x) will denote the observed 
probability as defined by p(x)=F(x)/N where 
F(x) is the frequency of occurrence of x, and 
N is the number of observed cases. N is, in 
the calculations, equal to the corpus size in 
words. Given this, the mutual information 
ratio (Church & Hanks, 1990; Church & 
Mercer, 1993; Steier & Belew, 1991) is 
expressed by Formula 1. (Church & Hanks 
refer to this measure as the association ratio 
tbr technical reasons).

\]./ - - lOg2(RWT)) ) (~2 ) = 
(N  *Occ(\[wl,w2l)~ 
Formula 1: The mutual information ratio 
The instability of statistical measures seems to 
be a problem in statistical bigralns. Especially 
low frequency counts cause instability. To 
avoid this use the rule of thumb that a bigram 
must occur more than four times (cf. Church 
& Hanks, 1990:p.24) to be considered as a 
candidate/br an interesting bigram. 
2.2 The dif ference in mutual  informa- 
tion: temporal  co-occurrence 
A reasonable way of using the temporal orde~ 
ring in word pairs is to consider the opposite 
ordering of the word pair as negative vidence 
against he present order. A reasonable mea- 
sure would be to use the difference in mutual 
information between the two orderings, here- 
after Ag. The size of the corpus cancels out 
and Ag can be calculated by a ratio between 
frequencies. This is intuitively correct for a 
comparison between apples and pears, i.e. 
you can say that apples (wl w2) occur twice 
as often as pears (w2 w l) in my fruit bowl 
(corpus). (p is the probability in the fixed 
corpus (fiN) which is different fi'om the pro- 
bability in the language. It is impossible to 
have a fixed corpus that equals the language 
since language does not have a fixed number 
of words or word patterns). 
2.2.1 Handl ing zero negative evidence 
In the case that the reversed ordering of a 
word pair has not been observed in the cor- 
pus, the measure becomes undefined. To reli- 
eve this the frequency t is multiplied by a 
constant (10), and the frequency of the rever- 
sed ordering is set to 1. Subtracting 9 from 
that value does not add anything to the mea- 
sure for a single occurrence (log(10-9)=0). 
Other ways of handling zero-frequencies 
are evaluated in (Gale & Church, 1994), e.g. 
the Good-Turing method. Relative frequen- 
cies of non-observed word pairs are hard to 
estimate. For example, the frequencies of fre- 
quencies (X) and frequency (Y) used in the 
1 1 will use 'frequency' as equivalent to'occurrence' in 
the sample corpus. 
Good-Turing method are linearly dependent 
in a log-log scale, i.e., there is an infinite fre- 
quency of non-observed items (which is 
another way of saying that we cannot expect 
the unexpected).

3 Illustration 
The difference between the two measures are 
perhaps best illustrated with some concrete 
examples. In a previous paper (Johansson, 
1.994) "Alice's adventures in Wonderhmd" 
(AIW) was used as an experimental corpus to 
compare phrase finding for ~t, and a new me- 
asure - -  A~t. A critique against hat corpus is 
that the corpus is very small. "Through the 
Looking Glass" and "The Hunting of the 
Snark" extend that corpus to about 63 000 
words of which 26 831 occurred more than 4 
times. With the criterion that an interesting bi- 
gram occurs more than 4 times 1970 bigram 
candidates were found in this larger corpus.

\[n the previous table the effect is measured by 
the number of steps a bigram is moved up

conditions is higher than the proposed 
measure for finding most characters in A1W, 
except for some names defined by definite 
article + noun, and common adjective + noun.

4 Material 6 Results 
In the rest of this paper, the corpus is the 
SUSANNE corpus (Sampson, 1994). This 
corpus consists of an extensively tagged and 
annotated subset from the Brown Corpus of 
American English. The corpus is fairly small, 
but provides information on grammatical roles 
on the word and phrase level. This makes the 
SUSANNE corpus suitable for further ese- 
arch. 
The SUSANNE corpus is divided into 4 
(approximately equally large) genre subcate- 
gones: 
"A: press reportage 
G: belles lettres, biography, memoirs 
J: learned (mainly scientific and 
technical) writing 
N: adventure and Western fiction" 
(Sampson, 1994:p. 1.74) 
Each genre has approximately 20,000 unique 
word pairs 2. The four genres will be used as 
one factor in the comparison between diffe- 
rent measures. The question is whether the 
genre interacts with the ability of the different 
measures to discover bigrams. In category A
439 unique bigrams (occurring more than 4 
times) were found, in G 486, in J 598, N 
620, and 2573 for the used corpus 3. 
5 Method 
The highest ranking bigralns according to the 
measure are sampled at 5 different levels: the 
10, 50, 100, 200 and 400 top collocations. 
Samples are sorted and compared for overlap 
by the UNIX command 'comm -12 
SAMPLE1 SAMPLE2 I wc -1', and the per- 
centage of overlap was calculated from the 
size of the sample. 
Stability of bigrams was tested by three diffe- 
rent overlaps. 1) The overlap between sam- 
ples from genres, and samples for the entire 
corpus for the same measure. 2) The overlap 
between different measures at the five diffe- 
rent levels for the different genres and the en- 
tire corpus. 3) The overlap between different 
genres.

3The last small part of each genre was excluded fi'om 
the start for future purposes. 
6.1 Mutual  Informat ion 
The average overlap between genres and the 
corpus showed that the J sample was much 
more stabile than the other genres 4. The J 
genre would be the genre that information re- 
trieval applications would be most interested 
in. The ranking of the genres according to the 
stability of the overlap is: JANG. The highest 
collocations are most stabile for J, where the 
other genres how less specificity (i.e. equal 
or growing percentages as the overlap 
grows).

6.2 Delta Mutual  Information 
Delta mutual information shows little effect of 
genre, and sample size. Growing sample size 
predicts less overlap. The ranking of genres 
is: GANJ. Delta mutual information seems to 
rank the less specific genres high.

A factorial ANOVA on measure and genre 
shows that there is a significant effect 
(p<0.001) of measure (Ag or g), genre and 
interaction between measures. F(measure, 
1df)=136.2, F(genre, 3df)=9.8, F(measure, 
genre, 1, 3)=15.4, p <0.001. These two me- 
asures are significantly different. 
6.3 Occurrence 
The results for the samples are similar to a m 
The overlap is generally higher for occurrence 
than Ag, but the ranking of genres is the 
same: GANJ. An ANOVA on measure (Ag 
and occurrence) and genre show less 
significant effect on measure, and no signi- 
ficant effect of genre, or interaction (these 
measures behave in the same direction). 
4In preliminary investigations the J genre was the 
least stabile genre for mutual information. This was 
'corrected' by the demand that candidate bigrams 
should occur more than 4 times.

more stabile than the other measure, but there 
is only a small difference of genres 
(occurrence and Ag react in a similar way to 
genre - -  i.e. on high occurrence). 
6.4 Comparison between measures 
The overlap between measures i calculated 
for all combinations of measures. At the hig- 
her levels a high overlap can be expected 
since there is little possibility to fall out (e.g. 
in A 400 out of 439 is 91% of the sample). 
The results from this test indicate that the 
overlap between D (Ag) and F (occurrence) is 
significantly and consistently higher than 
between the other combinations (especially 
for the entire corpus).

To estimate the overlap of the genres the 
number of common bigrams between two 
genres were found and compared to the size 
of the smallest genre. The results indicate an 
average overlap between the genres of 10%.

6.6 Reduction of the bigrams 
The bigrams that are rated high by the measu- 
res (especially mutual information) are mixed 
between two different ypes of bigrams: (1) 
bigrams with high internal cohesion between 
low frequency items that may be associated 
with a specific interpretation (e.g. "carbon te- 
trachloride" or "cheshire cat"), (2) bigrams 
with high internal cohesion with usually high 
frequency of both items that may be associ- 
ated with a "syntactical" interpretation (e.g. 
"in the"). 
To separate type l from type 2 some in- 
formation about the overlap of genres might 
be used. The type 2 bigrams are typically 
found in most genres, whereas type 1 bi- 
grams are specific to a text. The results above 
indicate that we can use the genres with least 
overlap to filter out common bigrams (i.e. A 
use J, G use J, J use N, N use J). 
In the following table the effect of the genre 
(column 2) is shown by the number of 
'surviving' bigrams from the candidate bi- 
grams (column 1). The third column shows 
the effect of removing the bigrams that occur 
(more than 4 times) in both directions after 
common bigrams have been removed (first 
parenthesis shows actual removed, second 
shows those that would have been removed 
(i.e. those bigrams with both orderings in the 
candidate set). The fourth column shows the 
effect of removing bigrams that contains 
words that occur more than 4 times in the rest 
of the corpus (i.e. in A G N for J) after the 
bigrams have been formed. The reason for 
filtering after forming bigrams is that words 
that are filtered out later work as place hol- 
ders, and prevent some bigrams to form. The 
reduction is most notable for removing bi- 
grams that contain common words between 
genres: genre G and N contain few good 
candidates ofcollocations type 1.

Genres G and N contain few candidates for 
collocations (among the 'best' ones in N were 
"gray eyes", "picked up", "help me" and "sta- 
red at" which are quite telling about he proto- 
typical western story: "The gray eyes stared at 
the villain who picked up his knife, while the 
girl cried "help me"." 
7 Other approaches 
The temporal dependencies of an ordered 
collocation \[wordl, word2\] has been seen as 
a problem since the theory of mutual infor- 
mation assumes the frequencies of word pairs 
to be symmetric (i.e., f(\[wl, w2\]) and f(\[w2, 
w 1\]) to be equal). Delta mutual information 
relies on this difference in temporal ordering. 
"\[...\] f(x, y) encodes linear prece- 
dence. \[...\] Although we could fix this 
problem by redefining f(x, y) to be 
symmetric (by averaging the matrix 
with its transpose), we have decided 
not to do so, since order information 
appears to be very interesting." 
(Church & Hanks, 1990:p.24) 
Merkel, Nilsson, & Ahrenberg (1994) have 
constructed a system that uses frequency of 
recurrent segments to determine long phrases. 
In their approach they have to chunk the text 
into contiguous egments. Significant fre- 
quency counts are achieved through the use of 
a very large corpus, and/or a corpus speciali- 
sed for a specific task. They report hat it was 
possible for them to divide a large corpus into 
smaller sub-sections with little loss. 
Smadja (1993)finds significant bigrams 
using an estimate of z-score (deviation from 
an expected mean). Smadja's method seems 
to require very large corpora, since the met- 
hod needs to estimate a reliable measure of the 
variance of the frequencies with which words 
co-occur. This makes the method dependent 
on the corpus size. Smadja reports the use of 
a corpus of size 10 million words. 
"More precisely, the statistical methods 
we use do not seem to be effective on 
low frequency words (fewer than 100 
occurrences)." (Smadja, 1993:p.168) 
Kita & al. (1994) proposed another measure 
of collocational strength that was based on the 
notion of a reduction in 'processing cost' if a 
frequent chunk of text can be processed as 
one chunk. Cost reduction tended to extract 
conventional 'predicate phrase patterns', e.g., 
"is that so" and "thank you very much". 
Steier & Belew (1991) discuss the 'exporting' 
of phrases into a general vocabulary, where a 
word pair with high mutual information 
within a topic tends to have lower mutual in- 
formation within the collection, and vice 
versa. They relate a higher mutual information 
within a topic than in the collection to a lower 
value of discrimination. 
Church & Gale (1995) have found it useful to 
compare the distribution of terms across do- 
cuments. They showed that a distribution dif- 
ferent from what could be expected by a 
(random) Poisson process indicates interest- 
ing terms. This approach is similar to the use 
of one genre to find interesting items in 
596 
another. However, removal of the overlap 
needs some knowledge about the genres - -  
apart from checking explicitly for a genre with 
least overlap. Cancelling overlap has the ad- 
vantage that it can cancel out similar underly- 
ing causes, while it exaggerates the underly- 
ing causes that differ between genres. Some 
questions remain: at which level should over- 
lap be formed? overlap in words or in bi- 
grams; how many repetitions does it take for 
a word or bigram to 'belong' to a genre? 
8 Conclusion 
The question is "what is gained by using a 
measure?". Mutual infornmtion tends to find 
combinations of words that are highly co-or- 
dinated with each other, but these bigrams 
show both interesting bigrams (e.g. "cheshire 
cat") and conventional (and uninteresting for 
keywords) bigrams (e.g. "in a"). The stability 
of interesting bigrams is improved by de- 
manding candidate bigrams to occur more 
than a fixed number of times. 
In this paper it has been shown that genre 
matters, and can be used to extract items that 
differ between genres. Instead of balancing 
one big corpus, the analysis of one corpus 
might benefit from finding out how it is diffe- 
rent from another corpus. The bigrams that 
were formed by using different genres as fil- 
ters showed interesting characteristics. 
However, if we are to deal with larger 
amounts of data it might be unrealistic to 
compare differences directly between two 
large genres without the exclusion of terms 
that occur by chance. 
The method that could be recommended 
from the results presented in this study is to 
triangulate a sample by the difference to other 
gcnres that we have some recta-knowledge 
about (i.e. we know that Western Fiction and 
Scientific Writing, at least on the surface, 
have little vocabulary in common).
