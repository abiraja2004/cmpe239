A part-of-speech tagged corpus is a very hnportant knowledge source for natural language processing researchers. 
'Poday, several part-of-speech tagged corpora re readily available for research use. \[Iowever, because there is wide 
diversity of morphological information systems (word-segmentation~ part-of-speech system, etc.), it is ditficult to 
use tagged corpora with an incompatible morphological infm'mation system. This paper proposes a me,hod of 
converting tagged corpora frOlll olte l l lorphellle system to allother, 
1 In t roduct ion  
Recently, mm,y natural language processing re- 
searchers have concentrated on corpus-based ap- 
proaches. Linguistic corpora can be classified as 
word-segmented corpora, part-of-speech tagged cor- 
pora, and parsed corpora, tlecause a part-of-speech 
tagged corpus is the most important corpus, much 
corpus-based natural language processing research 
has been performed using part-of-speech tagged cor- 
pora. 
Ilowever, building a large part-of-speech tagged 
corpus is very dillicult. It is even more difficult to 
build a corpus for languages without explicit word 
boundary characters, such as Japanese. q'herefore, 
researchers always complain of the scarcity of data in 
the corpus. 
To solve this data scarcity problem, previous works 
proposed methods of increasing the productivity 
of the labor required for building a part-of-speech 
tagged corpus. \[1\]. 
'.l'his paper proposes another method of acquir- 
ing large part-of-speech tagged corpora: restructur- 
ing tagged corpora by using morpheme adjustment 
rules. This method assures good use of the sharable 
part-of-speech tagged corpora that are already awdl- 
able such as the ATR Dialog Database (ADD) \[2; 
3\]. 
Ideally, these corpora could be used by all re- 
searchers and research groups without any modifica- 
tions, llowever, actual part-of-speech tagged corpora 
have the following problems: 
? Diversity of orthography: 
A word can be spelled in various ways. In 
Japanese, there are three types of character sets: 
kanji (i~.~"-), hiragana (~ to ~ ~), and katakana 
(:~J # :~J ?).  Also, people can use these character 
sets at their discretion. 
? Diversity of word segmentation: 
Because the Japanese language has no word 
boundary characters(i.e, blank spaces), there 
are no standards of word segmentation. A sin- 
gle word in a certain corpus may be considered 
nmltiple words in other corpora, and vice versa. 
? Diw;rsity of part-of speech systems: 
There are no standards for part-of-speech sys- 
tems. It is true that a detailed part-of-speech 
system can help the application of part-of-speech 
information, lint the labor required \['or lmilding 
corpora will continue to increase. This problem 
is language-independent. 
Diversities of word-segmentation and part-of- 
speech systems are fatal problems. The simplest way 
to solve these problems is to perform a morphological 
analysis on the raw text in the corpus, with no regard 
to the word-segmentation a d part-of-speech infer 
mation. Uowever, making a high-quality morphologi- 
cal analyzer demands much time and care. Addition- 
ally, it is wasteful to ignore the word-segmentation 
and part-of-speech i,fformation that h~s been ac- 
quired with much effort. 
In restructuring tagged corpora with nmrpheme ad- 
justmel,t rules, tim word-segrnentation and part-of- 
speech inlbrmation of the original corpus is rewrittm,, 
making good use of the original corpus information. 
"riffs method is characterized by reduced manual ef- 
fort. 
In the next section, the method of rest, rueturing 
tagged corpora is described in detail. Section 3 re- 
ports the result of an experiment in rewriting the 
corpus using this method. 
2 Restructuring Tagged Co l  
pora 
Restructuring tagged corpora involves the following 
three steps: 
? preparation of training set 
? extraction of morpheme adjustment rules 
? rewrith~g of corpora 
569 
2.1 Preparat ion of Training Set 
First, sentences for the training set are chosen from 
the corpus to be rewritten. New word-segmentation 
and part-of-speech information (morphological infor- 
mation) is given to the sentences by a morphologi- 
cal analyzer or by hand. Consequently, the training 
set has two sets of morphological information for the 
same raw text. Figure I shows an example of the 
training set. 
A large number of training sentences i desirable, 
but preparing many sentences requires much time and 
effort. A vmst nmnber of sentences would be required 
to extend coverage to content words (such as nouns, 
w'A)s, ete), but flmctionaI words (such as particles, 
auxiliary verbs, ere) can be covered with a smaller 
number of sentences.

2.2 Extract ion of Morpheme Adjust- 
ment Rules 
The method of extracting morpheme ad.iustment 
rules from the training set involves finding correspon- 
dence between rewriting units and extracting rules for 
unknown words: 
2.2.1. CorrespoiMenees of Rewr i t ing  Uni ts  
In languages without explicit word boundary char- 
acters, such as Japanese, a single word in a certain 
morphological information system may be divided 
into multiple words (one-to-many correspondence) 
in other morphological information systems, multi- 
pie words may be unified (many-to-one correspon- 
dence), or the segmentation of multiple words may 
be changed (many-to-many correspondence). Figure 
2 shows these correspondences. 
We developed an algorithm to find these correspon- 
dences (Appendix A). By using this algorithm, mor- 
pheme rewriting rules (Figure 3) can be extracted. 
2.2.2 Rules lot" Unknown Words 
Rewriting rules such as those shown in Figure 3 can 
rewrite only the words that appeared in the train- 
ing set,. If the training set is small, the coverage 
of the rules will be limited. Ilowever, because this 
n~orpheme adjnstment is a method of rewriting part- 
of-speech tagged corpora, the treatment of unknown

words is easier than with an ordinary morphological 
anaIyzer, because that our method can make good 
use of the part-of-speech information of the origi- 
nal corpus. Rules for unknown words without word- 
segmentation changes between two morphological in- 
formation systems can be extracted automatically 
from one-to-one correspondence rules in the rewrit- 
ing rules. 
Rules tbr unknown words with word-segmentation 
changes can also be extracted automatically by us- 
ing information concerning the length of the word's 
characters. For examph'., when a single verb with two 
characters in a certaiu morphological information sys- 
tem corresponds to two words (verb-stem with one 
character and verb-inflection with one character) in 
another morphological information system, the fol- 
lowing rewriting rule is extracted.

Figure 4 shows sample rules for unknown words. 
The heuristic knowledge of character sets that an 
ordinary Japanese morphological nalyzer uses (such 
as "katakana words are usually proper nom,s", "verb 
iMleetion words are spelled using hiragana", etc.) 
are also available in this nlorpheme adjustment ted> 
nique.

rewriting rules. 1 
l{owew;r, this ambiguity is not as great as the aml>i- 
guity that occurs in ordinary morphological analysis 
because our method makes good use of the inform;v- 
tion of the original corpus. Figure 6 shows the lattice 
structure formed when using the ordinary morpholog- 
ical analysis on the same raw text. Note that the size 
of this lattice is greater i.hail the size oF the lattice 
made by our method. 
2.3 .2  Latt iee Search 
The last step in restructuring tagged corpora can be 
considered a lattice search l)rol)lenl. \[U this step, all 
of the following knowledge sources for anlhiguil, y reso- 
lution used in ordinary morphological nalysis is also 
available in our method: 
? connection matr ix  
? heuristic preferences (longest word preference, 
minimum phrase preference, etc.) 
? stochastic preferences (word n-gram, IIMM, etc.) 
By using these knowledge sources, the most plausi- 
ble candidate is chosen. In effect, the original corpus 
is converted to a new eorptls that uses a different 
morphological information system. 
3 Exper iment  
3.1 Experimental Condition 
The targets in our experiment are a morl~hological 
information system for the A'I?II, l)ialog Database\[2; 
l'\])hls ambiguity mainly conies from l.he difl;Jrence iii part- 
oLspeech granularity between the two morphological infornla- 
\[,ion systenls, 
3\] and a morphological infornlation system lbr the 
unification-based Japanese grammar used in A'I'R's 
spoken language parser\[4\]. 'l.'hese two morphological 
information systenls haw; the following characteris- 
tics. 
? The ATR Dialog 13at.abase was developed as ma- 
terial for analyzing the characteristics of spoken- 
style Japanese. '\['herefore, the part-of-speech 
granularity is coarse. Additionally, because the 
word-.segmentation is based on a morphological 
and etymological criterion, compound nouns ~md 
compound words that fluiction as a single aux- 
iliary w~rb (e.g. "-C ~ zj ") are divided into sev- 
eral shorter word units. Ou the other hand, be- 
cause this database giw;s little consideration to 
mechanical processing, stems and inflections oF 
inflectional words are not segmented. 
? The nnification-based Japanese gramnmr has 
a medium-grained part-.of-speech (pre-ternlinal) 
system to make it both c\[tleient and easy to 
maintain\[5\]. Because the objective of the gram- 
Ynar is to ext rac t  the syntact i c  s t ruc tures  e l  
Japanese  sentences automatically and elIiciently, 
COml~OUnd words that funel.iml as a single word 
are usually recognized as a single word. On the 
other hand, steins amt ilHlectious of inllectional 
words  are seg l \ [ le l l ted  for eol lve l l ience ()l' nlechall.- 
ieal processiug. 
The above descriptions how that these nl?~rl~hologi- 
cal infl)rulation syst.ems differ. The objectiw~ of this 
experiment is to examine whether our method can 
adjust the differences between the two niorphological 
information systems to ~i considerable xtent. 
Firsl;, we chose 1,000 sentences fronl the A;I'li, 
Dialog Database as the training set and provided 
the morphological information (word-segmentation 
and lmrl.-of'-speech) of the unification-based Japanese

3.2 Rewriting of Morphological Infor- 
mation 
The experiment was performed bi-directionally be- 
tween the morphological information system of the 
ATt~ Dialog Database (ADD) and the morphologi- 
cal information system of unification-based Japanese 
grammar. 
3.2.1 From Uni f icat ion-Based Granmxar to 
ADD 
This experiment rewrites from a medimn-graiued 
morphological information system to a coarse-grained 
morphological information system. Table :1.2.1 shows 
the result of this rewriting. The segmentation er- 
ror rate and part-of-speech error rate were calculated 
using the same definition in \[1\]. Table 2 shows the 
result. 
The error rates seem to be rather large, but it 
should be noted that only simple knowledge sources 
are used both ill our method (the morpheme adjuster) 
and by the morphological nalyzer. Also, it is signif- 
icant that our targets are spoken-style Japanese sen- 
tences. Ordinary morphological analyzers can ana- 
lyze written-style Japanese sentences with a less than 
50_/o error rate, by using richer knowledge sources\[I\]. 
However, previous work reported that the error rate 
for automatic morphological nalysis of the ADD text 
is more than 15%\[6\]. 
hi comparing the two methods, the part-of-speech 
error rates of our method are clearly better than those 
of the morphological nalyzer. This shows that our 
method can make good use of tile original part-of- 
speech information. 
3.2.2 From ADD to Unl f icat lon-Based 
Japanese Grammar  
This experiment is more difficult because this rewrit- 
ing is from the coarse-grained morphological infor- 
nlation system to the medium-grained morphological 
information systeln. Table 3 shows the result. 
The part-of-speech error rates of our method are 
better in this rewriting experiment, oo. 
4 Conclusion 
This paper proposed restructuring of tagged corpora 
by using morpheme adjustment rifles. The even- 
tuaI goal of this work is to make precious knowledge 
sources truly sharable among many researchers. Tile 
results of tile experiment seem promising. 
Our rnorpbenle adjustment method has some re- 
semblaace to Brill's part-of-speech tagging method\[7\]. 
Brill's simple part-of-speech tagger call be considered 
a morpheme adjnster that adjusts differences between 
initial (default) tags and correct ta~s. 
As Brill applied his part-of-speech tagging tech- 
nique to tbe syntactic bracketing technique\[8\], we
believe that our method can be applied to the ad- 
justment of parsed corpora. In the work of Grish- 
man et al\[9\], tree rewriting rules to adjust differences 
between Tree Bank and their grammar were proba- 
bly prepared manually. By applying our method to 
parsed corpora, such rewriting rules call be extracted 
automatically.
