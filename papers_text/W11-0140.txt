Abstract
In this paper we present some features of an architecture for the translation (Italian ? Italian Sign
Language) that performs syntactic analysis, semantic interpretation and generation. Such architec-
ture relies on an ontology that has been used to encode the domain of weather forecasts as well as
information on language as part of the world knowledge. We present some general issues of the
ontological semantic interpretation and discuss the analysis of ordinal numbers.
1 Introduction
In this paper we describe some features of a system designed to translate from Italian into Italian Sign
Language (henceforth LIS). The system is being developed within the ATLAS project.1 This architec-
ture applies a hard computational linguistic approach: knowledge-based restricted interlingua (Hutchins
and Somer, 1992). We perform a deep linguistic processing in each phase of the translation, i.e (1)
syntactic analysis of the Italian input sentence, (2) semantic interpretation and (3) LIS generation.2 The
main motivation to adopt this ambitious architecture is that Italian and LIS are very different languages.
Moreover, LIS is a poorly studied language, so no large corpus is available and statistical techniques are
hardly conceivable. We reduce our ambitions by restricting ourselves to the weather forecasts application
domain.
In this paper we describe some major issues of the semantic interpretation and illustrate a case study
on ordinal numbers. Our semantic interpretation is based on a syntactic analysis that is a dependency tree
(Hudson, 1984; Lesmo, 2007). Each word in the sentence is associated with a node of the syntactic tree.
Nodes are linked via labeled arcs that specify the syntactic role of the dependents with respect to their
head (the parent node). A key point in semantic interpretation is that the syntax-semantics interface used
in the analysis is based on an ontology. The knowledge in the ontology concerns an application domain,
i.e. weather forecasts, as well as more general information about the world: the latter information is used
to compute the sentence meaning. Indeed, the sentence meaning consists of a complex fragment of the
ontology: predicate-argument structures and semantic roles are contained in this fragment and could be
extracted by translating this fragment into usual First Order Logic predicates.3
The idea to use the ontological paradigm to represent world knowledge as well as sentence meaning
is similar to the work by Nirenburg and Raskin (2004) and Buitelaar et al (2009), but in contrast to these
approaches (1) we use a syntactic parser to account for syntactic analysis; and (2) we use a recursive
semantic interpretation function similar to Cimiano (2009).
2 The Ontology
The ontological knowledge base is a formal (partial) description of the domain of application. It is for-
mal, since its primitives are formally defined, and it is partial, since it does not include all axioms that
provide details about the relationships between the involved concepts. The top level of the domain ontol-
ogy is illustrated in Fig. 1.4 The classes most relevant to weather forecasts are ??meteo-status-situation ,

2LIS, as all the signed languages do not have a natural writing form. In order to apply linguistic tools designed for written
languages, in our project we developed ?AEW-LIS?, an artificial written form for LIS.
3However, similar to other approach (among others Bunt et al (2007); White (2006)), our ontological meaning representa-
tion is totally unscoped.
4Some conventions have been adopted for ontology names: concepts (classes) have a ??prefix; instances have a ?prefix; and
relations and relation instances have a & prefix.

the hierarchy.
??geographic-area , ??description , ??geographic-part-selection-criterium .
??meteo-status-situation It is the most relevant class in the present setting, since it refers to the possi-
ble weather situations, thus providing a starting point ?in principle? to every weather forecast. It may
concern the sea status, a generic weather status (either stable or not) or possible atmospheric events such
as snow, rain or clouds.
??geographic-area and ??time-interval Any weather situation holds in a specific place; in particular,
the relevant places are geographic areas. A ??geographic-area can be an Italian region, a group of re-
gions, a sea, or may be identified by specifying a cardinal direction (North, South, . . . ). Yet, any weather
situation holds in a specific temporal interval. Such time interval could last one or more days or a part of
a day. Expression as ?in the evening? are interpreted anaphorically, i.e. on the basis of current context: if
the context is referring to ?today?, then it is interpreted as ?today evening?, for ?tomorrow? as ?tomorrow
evening?, etc..
??description The actual situation and its description are kept separated. For instance, if today is Octo-
ber 28, then ?today? is a ??deictic-description of a particular instance (or occurrence) of a ??day . ?April
28, 2010? is another description (absolute) of the same instance. Particular relevance have the deictic de-
scriptions since most temporal descriptions (today, tomorrow, but also the weekday names, as Monday,
Tuesday, . . . ) are deictic in nature.
??geogr-part-selection-criterium In descriptions, a particular instance (or group of instances) can be
identified by a general class term (e.g. area) and a descriptor (e.g. northern). This concept refers to the
parts of the reality that can act as descriptors. For instance, the cardinal direction can be such a criterium
for geographic parts, while a date is not.
The last relevant portion of the ontology concerns relations. Although the ontology has no axioms,
class concepts are connected through relevant relations. In turn, relations constitute the basic steps to
form paths (more later on). All relations in the ontology are binary, so that the representation of relations
of arity greater than 2 requires that they be reified.
3 Semantic Interpretation
One chief assumption in our work is that words meaning can be expressed in terms of ontology nodes,
and the meaning of the sentence is a complex path on the ontology that we call ontological restriction.
We define the meaning interpretation function MO, that computes the the ontological restriction of a
sentence starting from the its dependency analysis and on the basis of an ontology O.
Given a sentence S and the corresponding syntactic analysis expressed as a dependency tree depTree(S),
the meaning of S is computed by applying the meaning interpretation function to the root of the tree, that
is MO(root(depTree(S))). In procedural terms, the meaning for a sentence is computed in two steps:
(i) we annotate each word of the input sentence with the corresponding lexical meaning; (ii) we build the

actual ontological representation in a quasi-compositional way, by merging paths found in the ontology
in a single representation which is a subgraph of the ontology itself. These two steps can be formalized
as a meaning interpretation function M defined as:
MO(n) :=
{
LMO(n) if n is a leaf
??ki=1(CPO(LMO(n),MO(di))) otherwise
where n is the node of a dependency tree and d1, d2, . . . , dk are its dependents. LMO(w) is a function
that extracts the lexical meaning of a word w accessing the dictionary: that is, a class or an individual
on the ontology O. CPO(y, z) is a function that returns the shortest path on O that connects y to z.
The search for connections relies on the rationale that the shortest path between any two ontology nodes
represents the stronger semantic connection between them. In most cases the distance between two
concepts is the number of the nodes among them, but in some cases a number of constraints needs to
be satisfied too (see the example on ordinal construction). Finally, the operator ?? is used to denote a
particular merge operator, similar to Cimiano (2009). As a general strategy, shortest paths are composed
with the union operation, but each CPO(y, z) conveys a peculiar set of ontological constraints: the merge
operator takes all such constraints to build the overall complex ontological representation. In particular, a
number of semantic clashes can arise from the union operation: we use a number of heuristics to resolve
these clashes. For sake of simplicity (and space) in this definition we do not describe the heuristics
used in the ambiguity resolution. However, three distinct types of ambiguity exist: (1) lexical ambiguity,
i.e. a word can have more than one lexical meaning; (2) shortest path ambiguity, i.e. two nodes can
be connected by two equal-length paths; (3) merge ambiguity, i.e. two fragments of ontology can be
merged in different manners. Whilst lexical ambiguity has not a great impact due to the limited domain
(and could be addressed by standard word sense disambiguation techniques), handling shortest path and
merge ambiguities needs heuristics expressed as constraints that rely on general world knowledge.
A particular case of ontological constraints in merge ambiguity is present in the interpretation of
ordinal numbers, so further details on the merge operator can be found in Section 4.
4 A case study: the ordinal numbers
In order to translate from Italian into LIS, we need to cope with a number of semantic phenomena
appearing in the particular domain chosen as pilot study, i.e. weather forecast. One of the most frequent
constructions are ordinal numbers. Consider the simple phrase l?ultimo giorno del mese (the last day
of the month). The (simplified) dependency structure corresponding to this phrase is depicted in Fig. 2:
the head word giorno (day) has two modifying dependents, ultimo (last) and mese (month). Since the
interpretation relies heavily on the access to the ontology, we first describe the portion of the ontology
used for the interpretation and then we illustrate the application of the function M to the given example.
The relevant fragment of the ontology is organized as shown in Fig. 3, that has been split in two parts.
The upper part ?labeled TEMPORAL PARTS? describes the reified ??part-of relation and its temporally
specialized subclasses. The lower part ?labeled ORDINALS? is constituted by some classes that account
just for ordinal numbers. In the TEMPORAL PARTS region of the Fig. we find the ??temporal-part-of
(reified) sub-relation, which, in turn, subsumes ??day-month-part-of . This specifies that days are parts of
months, so that day of the month can be interpreted as the day which is part of the month. The ??part-of
relation has two roles: we use the term role to refer to the binary relation associated with a participant
in a reified relation. These roles are ?value-restricted? as &day-in-daymonth and &month-in-daymonth
respectively, for what concerns ??day-month-part-of . The most relevant class in the ORDINALS part
of Fig. 3 is the class ??ordinal-description . It is the domain of three roles, 1) &ord-described-item , 2)
&references-sequence and 3) &ordinal-desc-selector . The range of the first relation &ord-described-item
is the item whose position in the sequence is specified by the ordinal, that is a ??sequenceable-entity.
The range of the second relation &reference-sequence is the sequence inside which the position makes

sense, that is an ??entity-sequence . The range of the third relation &ordinal-desc-selector is item that
specifies the position, that is a ??ordinal-selector . In the example, ?last is an instance of ??ordinal-
selector . Of course, any (true) ordinal (first, second, thirtythird) can fill that role. The two portions of
the ontology are connected by two arcs. The first arc specifies that a ??time-interval is a subclass of
??sequenceable-entity (so that one can say the fourth minute, the first year, and so on). The second arc
specifies that ??month is subclass of ??day-sequence , which in turn is subclass of ??entity-sequence .
As a consequence it can play the role (can be the range) of the &reference-sequence .
We now describe how the meaning interpretation function is applied on the considered example. It
consists of three steps: 1. we compute the connection path between the concepts ??day and ?last ; 2. we
compute the connection path between ??day and ??month ; 3. we merge the connection paths previously
computed. In details:
1. By computing CP(??day, ?last) we obtain the connection path in Fig 4-a. Note that this ontological
restriction contains the concept ??ordinal-selector .
2. By computing CP(??day, ??month) we obtain the connection path in Fig 4-b. In this case the shortest
path is not actually the ?shortest? one, i.e. the presence of the preposition del (of ) constraints the value
returned by CP . Moreover, this ontological restriction contains the concept ??day-month-part-of , which
is a sub-concept of ??part-of .
3. The last step consists of the application of the meaning composition function to CP(??day, ?last) and
CP(??day, ??month). The ??ordinal-description concept is detected in the first ontological restriction;
moreover ??day is recognized as (subclass of) a possible filler for ??ordinal-description . At this point
we need establishing how ??day fits as the smaller part of a &part-of relation. We scan the remain-
ing ontological restriction(s) looking for a bigger part involved in a &part-of relation or in any of its
sub-relations. The resulting representation (Fig. 4-c) is built by assuming that the larger entity (here
??month , since &month-in-daymonth restricts &part-bigger) is the reference sequence for the ordering.
So, the direct ??day-month-part-of of the second ontological restriction is replaced by a path passing
through ??ordinal-description . In such final ontological restriction ??day is the &ord-described-item
and ??month is the &reference-sequence .

ture for the translation from Italian into LIS. The structure produced by the semantic interpretation of the

source sentence is a complex ontology fragment obtained by the application of the function MO. As case
study we showed how this function uses the ontology O to interpret the ordinal numbers. The decision
to use an ontology fragment as semantic representation is motivated by theoretical assumptions and has
some practical appeals. From a theoretical point of view, we represent language semantics as part of the
world knowledge in ontologies (Buitelaar et al, 2009; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007; Nirenburg
and Raskin, 2004). From an applicative point of view the ontology restriction produced by the semantic
interpretation is used (in logical form) as input of the OpenCCG tool, in the generation component of the
translation architecture (White, 2006). As a consequence, similar to Nirenburg and Raskin (2004), we
use ontologies in all components of our architecture (cf. Galanis and Androutsopoulos (2007); Sun and
Mellish (2007)).
We have currently implemented the main features of the MO and the ontology is being developed.
Our working hypothesis is that the weather forecast sub-language is characterized by plain and short
sentences and this guarantees scalability of our approach. In the next future we plan to broaden the
coverage of linguistic phenomena, so to unify ordinals, superlative and comparative adjective analyses.5
