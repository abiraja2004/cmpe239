Abstract
This paper presents a method that as-
sists in maintaining a rule-based
named-entity recognition and classifi-
cation system. The underlying idea is to
use a separate system, constructed with
the use of machine learning, to monitor
the performance of the rule-based sys-
tem. The training data for the second
system is generated with the use of the
rule-based system, thus avoiding the
need for manual tagging. The dis-
agreement of the two systems acts as a
signal for updating the rule-based sys-
tem. The generality of the approach is
illustrated by applying it to large cor-
pora in two different languages: Greek
and French. The results are very en-
couraging, showing that this alternative
use of machine learning can assist sig-
nificantly in the maintenance of rule-
based systems.
1 Introduction
Machine learning has recently been proposed as
a promising solution to a major problem in lan-
guage engineering: the construction of lexical
resources. Most of the real-world language en-
gineering systems make use of a variety of lexi-
cal resources, in particular grammars and lexi-
cons. The use of general-purpose resources is
ineffective, since in most applications a special-
ised vocabulary is used, which is not supported
by general-purpose lexicons and grammars. For
this reason, significant effort is currently put
into the construction of generic tools that can
quickly adapt to a particular thematic domain.
The adaptation of these tools mainly involves
the adaptation of domain-specific semantic lexi-
cal resources.
Named-entity recognition and classification
(NERC) is the identification of proper names in
text and their classification as different types of
named entity (NE), e.g. persons, organisations,
locations, etc. This is an important subtask in
most language engineering applications, in par-
ticular information retrieval and extraction. The
lexical resources that are typically included in a
NERC system are a lexicon, in the form of gaz-
etteer lists, and a grammar, responsible for rec-
ognising the entities that are either not in the
lexicon or appear in more than one gazetteer
lists. The manual adaptation of those two re-
sources to a particular domain is time-
consuming and in some cases impossible, due to
the lack of experts. The exploitation of learning
techniques to support this adaptation task has
attracted the attention of researchers in language
engineering.
However, the adaptation of lexical resources
to a specific domain at a certain point in time is
not sufficient on its own. The performance of a
NERC system degrades over time (Vichot et al,
1999; Wolinski et al, 2000) due to the introduc-
tion of new NEs or the change in the meaning of
existing ones. We need to find ways that facili-
tate the maintenance of rule-based NERC sys-
tems. This paper presents such a method, ex-
ploiting machine learning in an innovative way.
Our method controls rule-based NERC systems
with NERC systems constructed by a machine
learning algorithm. The method comprises two
stages: the training stage, during which a super-
vised machine learning algorithm constructs a
new system using data generated by the rule-
based system, and the deployment stage, in
which the results of the two systems are com-
pared on new data and their disagreements are
used as signals for change in the rule-based sys-
tem. Note that, unlike most applications of su-
pervised machine learning, the training data for
the new system are not produced manually.
In order to illustrate the generality of this ap-
proach, we have tested it with two different
NERC systems, one for Greek and another one
for French. The results are very encouraging and
show that machine learning techniques can be
used for the maintenance of rule-based systems.
Section 2 presents existing work on the do-
main adaptation of NERC systems using ma-
chine learning (ML) techniques. Section 3 pre-
sents the two rule-based NERC systems for
Greek and French. Section 4 explains our
method and Section 5 describes the two experi-
ments and presents the evaluation results. Fi-
nally, Section 6 concludes and presents our fu-
ture plans.
2 Related Work
As mentioned above, the exploitation of learning
techniques to support the domain adaptation of
NERC systems has recently attracted the atten-
tion of several researchers. Some of these ap-
proaches are briefly discussed in this section.
Nymble (Bikel et al, 1997) uses statistical
learning to acquire a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) that recognises NEs in text. Nymble did
particularly well in the MUC-7 competition
(DARPA, 1998), due mainly to the use of the
correct features in the encoding of words, e.g.
capitalisation, and the probabilistic modelling of
the recognition system.
Named-entity recognition in Alembic (Vilain
and Day, 1996) uses the transformation-based
rule learning approach introduced in Brill?s
work on part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1993). An
important aspect of this approach is the fact that
the system learns rules that can be freely inter-
mixed with hand-engineered ones.
The RoboTag system presented in (Bennett
et al, 1997) constructs decision trees that clas-
sify words as being start or end points of a par-
ticular named-entity type. A variant of this ap-
proach was used in the system presented by the
New York University (NYU) in the Multilingual
Entity Task (MET-2) of MUC-7 (Sekine, 1998).
The system developed for Italian in ECRAN
(Cuchiarelli et al, 1998), uses unsupervised
learning to expand a manually constructed sys-
tem and improve its performance. The learning
algorithm tries to supplement the manually con-
structed system by classifying recognised but
unclassified NEs. In (Petasis et al, 2000) the
manually constructed system was replaced by
the supervised tree induction algorithm C4.5
(Quinlan, 1993), reaching very good perform-
ance on the MUC-6 corpora.
The partially supervised multi-level boot-
strapping approach presented in (Riloff and
Jones, 1999) induces a set of information extrac-
tion patterns, which can be used to identify and
classify NEs. The system starts by generating
exhaustively all candidate extraction patterns,
using an earlier system called AutoSlog (Riloff,
1993). Given a small number of seed examples
of NEs, the most useful patterns for recognising
the seed examples are selected and used to ex-
pand the set of classified NEs. The end result is
a dictionary of NEs and the extraction patterns
that correspond to them.
Our method follows an alternative innovative
approach to the use of learning for NERC. In-
stead of using ML to construct a NERC system
that will be used autonomously, the system con-
structed by ML, according to our approach is
used to monitor the performance of an existing
rule-based NERC system. In this manner, the
new system provides feedback on whether the
rule-based system under control has become
obsolete and needs to be updated. An important
advantage of this approach is that no manual
tagging of training data is needed, despite the
use of a supervised learning algorithm.
Our method bears some similarities with sys-
tems based on active learning (Thompson et al,
1999). According to this technique, multiple
classifiers performing the same task are used in
order to actively create training data, through
their disagreements. Usually, this involves an
iterative procedure. First a few initial labelled
examples are used to train the classifiers and
then, unlabelled examples are presented to the
classifiers. Examples that cause the classifiers to
disagree are good candidates to retrain the clas-
sifiers on. The difference of active learning to
our method is the use of a manually-constructed
rule-based NERC system as the basic system.
The ML method is used only to identify when
the rule-based NERC system should be updated,
but not for creating new training instances. An-
other approach, which bears some similarity to
ours, is presented in (Kushmerick, 1999) where
a heuristic algorithm is used to monitor the per-
formance of web-page wrappers.
3 Rule-based NERC Systems
A typical NERC system consists of a lexicon
and a grammar. The lexicon is a set of NEs that
are known beforehand and have been classified
into semantic classes. The grammar is used to
recognize and classify NEs that are not in the
lexicon and to decide upon the final classes of
NEs in ambiguous cases.
Manual construction of NERC systems is a
complicated and time-consuming process, even
for experts. The meaning of a single sentence
may vary a lot according to which category a
NE is assigned to. For example, the sentence
?Express group intends to sell Le Point for 700
MF? indicates a sale of a newspaper company, if
?Le Point? is classified as an organisation.
Whereas the following sentence, which is
grammatically identical to the previous one,
?Compagnie des Signaux intends to sell
TVM430 for 700 MF? gives only a price for an
industrial product.
In order for a NERC system to be able to
recognise and categorise correctly NEs, both the
lexicon and the grammar have to be validated on
large corpora, testing their efficiency and their
robustness. However, this process does not en-
sure that the performance of the developed sys-
tem will remain steady over time. Almost under
all thematic domains, the introduction of new
NEs or the change in the meaning of existing
ones can increase the error rate of the system.
Our approach tries to identify such cases, facili-
tating the maintenance of the NERC system.
The following subsections briefly describe
the Greek and French rule-based NERC systems
that have been used in our experiments.
3.1 The Greek NERC System
The Greek NERC system (Farmakiotou et al,
2000) used for the purposes of this experiment
forms part of a larger Greek information extrac-
tion system, being developed in the context of
the R&D project MITOS.1 The NERC compo-
nent of this system mainly consists of three
processing stages: linguistic pre-processing, NE
identification and NE classification. The linguis-
tic pre-processing stage involves some basic
tasks: tokenisation, sentence splitting, part-of-
speech tagging and stemming. Once the text has
been annotated with part of speech tags, a
stemmer is used. The aim of the stemmer is to
reduce the size of the lexicon as well as the size
and complexity of the NERC grammar.
The NE identification stage involves the de-
tection of their boundaries, i.e., the start and the
end of all the possible spans of tokens that are
likely to belong to a NE. Identification consists
of three sub-stages: initial delimitation, separa-
tion and exclusion. Initial delimitation involves
the application of general patterns. These pat-
terns are combinations of a limited number of
words, selected types of tokens (e.g. tokens con-
sisting of capital characters), special symbols
and punctuation marks. At the separation sub-
stage, possible NEs that are likely to contain
more than one NE or a NE attached to a non-
NE, are detected and attachment problems are
resolved. Finally, at the exclusion sub-stage two
types of criteria are used for exclusion from the
possible NE list: the context of the phrase and
being part of an exclusion list. Suggestive con-
text for exclusion consists of common names
that refer to products, services or artifacts. The
exclusion list includes capitalized abbreviations
of common nouns, financial terms, capitalized
person titles, which are not ambiguous, and
nouns commonly found in names of products,
artifacts and services.
Once the possible NEs have been identified,
the classification stage begins. Classification
involves three sub-stages: application of classi-
fication rules, gazetteer-based classification, and
partial matching of classified named-entities
with unclassified ones. Classification rules take
into account both internal and external evidence
(McDonald, 1996), i.e., the words and symbols
that comprise the possible name and the context
in which it occurs. Gazetteer-based classifica-
tion involves the look up of pre-stored lists of
known proper names (gazetteers). The gazet-
teers contain stemmed forms and have been
compiled from Web sites and an annotated train-
1 http://www.iit.demokritos.gr/skel/mitos
ing corpus. The size of the gazetteers is rather
small (3,059 names). At the partial matching
sub-stage, classified names are matched against
unclassified ones aiming at the recognition of
the truncated or variable forms of names.
3.2 The French NERC System
The French NERC system has been imple-
mented with the use of a rule-based inference
engine (Wolinski et al, 1995). It is based on a
large knowledge base (lexicon) including 8,000
proper names that share 10,000 forms and con-
sist of 11,000 words. It has been used continu-
ously since 1995 in several real-time document
filtering applications (Wolinski et al, 2000).
The uses of the NERC system in these applica-
tions are the following:
1. Segmentation of NEs, in order to improve
the performance of the syntactic analyser, par-
ticularly in the case of long proper names which
contain grammatical markers (e.g. prepositions,
conjunctions, commas, full stops).
2. Recognition of known NEs in order to sup-
ply precise information to a document filtering
module.
3. Classification of NEs in order to feed a
document filtering module with information
dealing with the very nature of the NEs quoted
in the documents.
The NERC system tries to classify each NE
in one of four different categories: association
(non-commercial organisation), person, location
or company.
For the classification of known entities, a
crucial problem appears when several NEs share
a single form. To deal with these cases, two sets
of rules have been implemented:
1. Local context: For instance, ?Saint-Louis?
may be interpreted in one of the following ways:
the capital of Missouri, a French group in the
food production industry, a small industry ?les
Cristalleries de Saint Louis?, a small town in
France, a hospital in Paris, etc. Exploration of
the local context using the proper name may
enable, in certain cases, a choice to be made
between these various interpretations. If the text
speaks of ?St-Louis (Missouri)?, only the first
interpretation should be adopted. In order to do
this the knowledge base should contain informa-
tion that ?Saint-Louis? is in Missouri, and a rule
should exist to interpret the affixing of a paren-
thesis.
2. Global context: Abbreviated NEs and acro-
nyms are much more frequent sources of ambi-
guity and are almost always common to several
NEs. In general, such ambiguous forms of NEs
do not occur on their own in news but almost
always together with non-ambiguous forms that
enable the ambiguity to be removed. For in-
stance, if the NEs ?Saint-Louis? and ?H?pital
Saint-Louis? appear in a single news item, the
interpretation corresponding to the hospital is
more likely to be the one that should be adopted.
For unknown entities, three sets of rules have
been implemented:
1. Prototypes: Many NEs are constructed ac-
cording to some prototypes. These can be cate-
gorised using pattern matching rules. Mr Andr?
Blavier, Kyocera Corp, Cond?-sur-Huisne,
Honda Motor, IBM-Asia, Bernard Tapie
Finance, Siam Nissan Automobile Co Ltd are
good examples of such prototypes.
2. Local context: Many single-word unknown
NEs (some known NEs as well) may also be
categorised using the local context. For instance,
the small sentences ?Peskine, director of the
group?, ?the shareholders of Fibaly ? or ?the
mayor of Gisenyi? are used as categorisation
rules.
3. Global context: After the first appearance of
a NE in full, its head (e.g. family name, main
company) is often used alone in the text instead
of the full name. The company Kyocera Corp,
for example, may be designated by the single
word Kyocera in the remainder of the text. For
each such unknown word, starting with a capital
letter, a special rule examines whether it appears
inside another NE in the text.
4 Controlling a Rule-based System Us-
ing Machine Learning
Machine learning has been used successfully to
control a rule-based system that performs a dif-
ferent task, namely document filtering (Wolinski
et al, 2000). The learning method used in that
case was a neural network (Stricker et al, 2001).
In our present study, we control the rule-
based NERC systems that have been presented
in section 3, with NERC systems constructed by
the C4.5 algorithm. Our method comprises two
stages: the training stage, during which C4.5
constructs a new system using data generated by
the rule-based system, and the deployment stage,
in which the results of the two systems are com-
pared on new data and their disagreements are
used as signals for change in the rule-based sys-
tem. This section describes the basic principles
of our control method.
4.1 Control method: training stage
The training stage of our method consists of the
following processing steps (Figure 1):
Running the rule-based NERC system on a
large training corpus (containing several thou-
sands of NEs in our case). The aim of this proc-
ess is to recognise and classify the NEs in the
corpus. The end product is a set of NEs, associ-
ated with their class.
Constructing a separate NERC system by ap-
plying C4.5 on the data generated by the rule-
based system. In this process, the classified NEs
are used as training data by C4.5, in order to
construct the second NERC system (trained
NERC). For each classified NE a training exam-
ple (vector) is created, containing information
about the part of speech and gazetteer tags of the
first and the last two words of the NE, as well as
the two words preceding and the two following
the NE. It is important to note that, unlike other
uses of supervised machine learning methods,
this approach does not require manual tagging of
training data.

4.2 Control method: deployment stage
In the deployment stage, the two NERC systems
are compared on a new corpus to identify dis-
agreements. Despite the fact that the second
method is trained on data generated by the first,
the different nature of the NERC system gener-
ated by C4.5, i.e., a decision tree, leads to inter-
esting disagreements between the two methods.
The deployment stage consists of the following
processing steps (Figure 2):
1. Running the rule-based NERC system on a
new corpus. It should be stressed here that the
documents in this corpus differ in some charac-
teristic way from those in the training corpus. In
our experiments the difference is chronological,
i.e., the new corpus consists of recent news arti-
cles. The reason for adopting this approach is
that we are interested in the maintenance of a
rule-based system through time. An alternative
approach might be for the new corpus to be from
a slightly different thematic domain. In that
case, the goal of the process would be the cus-
tomisation of the rule-based system to a new
domain.

same corpus.
3. Comparing the results provided by both sys-
tems to identify cases of disagreement. The re-
sult is a set of data where the two systems dis-
agree: in our case, disagreements deal with the
different categories assigned by the NERC sys-
tems to NEs (see Section 5 for detailed results).
These cases are then provided to the language
engineer, who needs to evaluate them and de-
cide on changes for the rule-based system.

5 Results
In order to evaluate the proposed method, two
different experiments were contacted, one for
each language. The exact experimental settings
as well as the evaluation results are presented in
the following sections.
5.1 Results for the Greek System
For the experiment regarding the Greek lan-
guage, we used three NE classes: organisations,
persons and locations. For the purposes of the
experiment, two corpora of financial news were
used.2 The first corpus that was used for training
purposes, consisted of 5,000 news articles from
the years 1996 and 1997, containing 10,010
instances of NEs (1,885 persons, 1,781 loca-
tions, 6,344 organisations). The second corpus
2 The corpora were provided by the Greek publishing com-
pany Kapa-TEL.
that was used for evaluation purposes consisted
of 5,779 news from the years 1999 and 2000 and
contained 11,786 instances of NEs (1,137 per-
sons, 810 locations, 9,839 organisations).
5.1.1 Aggregate Results
A good way to give an overview of the cases of
disagreement of the two systems is through a
contingency matrix, as shown in Table 1. The
rows of this table correspond to the classifica-
tion of the rule-based system, while the columns
to the classification of the system constructed by
C4.5.
Table 1: Overview of the results for Greek.
organisation. person location
organisation 9,906 250 32
person 230 649 14
location 24 6 675
As we can see from Table 1, in 95% of the cases
the two systems are in agreement. This means,
that in order to update the rule-based NERC
system, we have to examine only 5% of the
cases, where the two systems disagree. Examin-
ing these cases gave us important insight regard-
ing problems of the rule-based NERC system.
Some examples are presented in the following
sections.
5.2 Recognition problems
The examination of cases in disagreement re-
vealed some interesting problems regarding NE
recognition. These problems concern NEs that
the rule-based system identified only partially
and as a result classified them incorrectly.
For example, in the stage of initial delimita-
tion, the general patterns fail to identify NEs that
contain numbers in their names, like the organi-
sation ?????? 2004? (Athens 2004) represent-
ing the organising committee of 2004 Olympics.
In addition, during the separation phase some
of the rules have not taken into account some
inflexional endings, causing failures in separat-
ing some NEs. For example, in the phrase ?? ??.
?????????? ?. ????????? (the under-secretary
of Culture ?. ????????) the recogniser failed to
separate the person name from its title, due to
the last accented character of the word ???????-
?????.
Finally, we were able to locate several stop-
words and update our exclusion list. For in-
stance, the phrase ???????? ISDN? (ISDN
lines) was recognised as an organisation (as the
word ????????? is a frequent constituent of
airline or shipping companies), but in reality the
text was referring to ISDN telephone lines.
5.2.1 Classification problems
Except from the problems identified in the rec-
ognition phase, the examination of the cases of
disagreement revealed various problems regard-
ing mainly the classification grammar. In fact,
some of our classification rules were found to be
too general, leading to wrong classifications.
For example, according to one of the rules, a
sequence of two words, starting with capital
letters, constitutes a person name if it is pre-
ceded by a definite article and the endings of
these two words belong in a specific set that
usually denote person names. This rule caused
the classification of various non-NEs as persons,
including ???? ?????????? ??????? (the
Olympic Village).
Another example of an overly general rule is
a rule that classifies a sequence of abbreviations
or nouns starting with capital letter as an organi-
sation, if this sequence is preceded by a comma
that in turn is preceded by a NE already classi-
fied as an organisation. This rule caused the
classification of few person names as organisa-
tions, such as ?? ????????? ??? ??????? ?????-
???, ?.????????? (the director of National
Bank, ?.????????).
5.3 Results for the French System
The corpus used for the French experiment con-
tained dispatches from the Agence France-
Presse from April 1998 until January 2001. The
thematic domain of the corpus was shareholding
events. This corpus contained six thousand
documents, including 180,983 instances of NEs
with the following distribution: companies
(45%), locations (45%), persons (7%) and asso-
ciations (non commercial organisations) (3%).
For the purposes of this experiment, the corpus
was chronologically split in two parts. The part
containing the chronologically earlier messages
was used for training purposes while the second
part, containing the most recent messages, was
used in order to evaluate our approach. In this
experiment, we mainly focused on four NE
categories, instead of the three categories used
for the Greek experiment. This differentiation
originates in the fact that the French NERC sys-
tem further categorises organisations into asso-
ciations (non-profit organisations) and compa-
nies.
5.3.1 Aggregate Results
The contingency matrix giving an overview of
the cases of disagreement of the two systems is
shown in Table 2. It appears that in 91% of the
cases the two systems are in agreement.
Table 2: Overview of the results for French.

person 3 4,498 46 509
location 11 51 6,870 2,526
company 296 67 534 34,946
Examining the disagreement cases gave us im-
portant insight regarding problems of the rule-
based system. The following sections present
some interesting examples.
5.3.2 Recognition problems
Similarly to the Greek experiment, the examina-
tion of disagreements revealed some interesting
problems in the recognition of NEs. For in-
stance, ?Europe 1? is a well-known French radio
station, also written sometimes as ?Europe Un?
(Europe One). The rule-based system failed to
identify ?Europe Un? and only identified
?Europe? as a location. The source of the prob-
lem is the lack of a mapping between fully writ-
ten numbers and numerical figures.
Another example is the phrase ?Le Mans
Re?, which is a shortened version of the com-
pany name ?Les mutuelles du Mans
Reassurance? (a Reinsurance company). The
rule-based system recognised only ?Le Mans? as
a location, due to the well-known French city.
What is needed here is an extension of the seg-
mentation rules to include ?Re? as a ?company
designator?, such as ?Motor?, ?Bank? or ?Tele-
com?.
5.3.3 Classification problems
Most of the classification problems that were
identified concerned NEs already known to the
system that meanwhile have acquired new
meanings. For example, ?Ariane II rach?te?
(Ariane II buys) is classified as a person, due to
the word ?Ariane? contained in the lexicon as a
person forename. In reality, ?Ariane II? is a new
company that should also be included in the
lexicon database. Another example is ?Orange?
already included in the lexicon as an old French
city. In the meanwhile, a new French company
has been created having the same name, as in
the example ?Orange, valoris?e par les analys-
tes? (Orange, estimated by analysts). Also in this
case, the lexicon must be updated with a second
entry for this entity, categorised as a company.
Besides lexicon omissions, some problems
regarding the classification grammar were also
revealed. First, overly general rules were identi-
fied, such as the one that classifies entities start-
ing from ?A? and followed by numbers as
French highway names. This rule wrongly clas-
sified the NE ?A3XX? as a highway, while the
text was referring to an airplane model:
?L?A3XX, un avion? (The A3XX, an air plane).
Our approach also succeeded in locating
well-known NEs used in a new context. For
example, the rule-based NERC system recog-
nises ?Taittinger? as a company while the sys-
tem learned by C4.5 disagrees with this classifi-
cation in the sentence ?la famille Taittinger? (the
family Taittinger). In this case, the grammar
should be updated with a rule saying that the
word ?family? in front of a proper name sug-
gests a person name.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed an alternative
use of machine learning in named-entity recog-
nition and classification. Instead of constructing
an autonomous NERC system, the system con-
structed with the use of machine learning assists
in the maintenance of a rule-based NERC sys-
tem. An important feature of the approach is the
use of a supervised learning method, without the
need for manual tagging of training data. The
proposed approach was evaluated with success
for two different languages: Greek and French.
On-going work aims at reducing the number
of disagreements between the two systems down
to those that are essential for the improvement
of the system. Currently, there are many cases
where the two systems disagree, but the rule-
based system is correct.
Another extension that we are examining is
to train a NERC system to not only classify, but
also recognise NEs. We believe that this exten-
sion will lead to the identification of more prob-
lematic cases in the recognition phase.
In conclusion, the method presented in this
paper proposes a simple and effective use of
machine learning for the maintenance of rule-
based systems. The scope of this approach is
clearly wider than that examined here, i.e.,
named-entity recognition.
