Abstract
This paper describes the joint QUAERO sub-
mission to the WMT 2012 machine transla-
tion evaluation. Four groups (RWTH Aachen
University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy, LIMSI-CNRS, and SYSTRAN) of the
QUAERO project submitted a joint translation
for the WMT German?English task. Each
group translated the data sets with their own
systems and finally the RWTH system combi-
nation combined these translations in our final
submission. Experimental results show im-
provements of up to 1.7 points in BLEU and
3.4 points in TER compared to the best single
system.
1 Introduction
QUAERO is a European research and develop-
ment program with the goal of developing multi-
media and multilingual indexing and management
tools for professional and general public applica-
tions (http://www.quaero.org). Research in machine
translation is mainly assigned to the four groups
participating in this joint submission. The aim of
this WMT submission was to show the quality of a
joint translation by combining the knowledge of the
four project partners. Each group develop and main-
tain their own different machine translation system.
These single systems differ not only in their general
approach, but also in the preprocessing of training
and test data. To take the advantage of these dif-
ferences of each translation system, we combined
all hypotheses of the different systems, using the
RWTH system combination approach.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, the different engines of all four groups are in-
troduced. In Section 3, the RWTH Aachen system
combination approach is presented. Experiments
with different system selections for system combi-
nation are described in Section 4. Finally in Section
5, we discuss the results.
2 Translation Systems
For WMT 2012 each QUAERO partner trained their
systems on the parallel Europarl and News Com-
mentary corpora. All single systems were tuned
on the newstest2009 or newstest2010 development
set. The newstest2011 dev set was used to train
the system combination parameters. Finally, the
newstest2008-newstest2010 dev sets were used to
compare the results of the different system combina-
tion settings. In this Section all four different system
engines are presented.
2.1 RWTH Aachen Single Systems
For the WMT 2012 evaluation the RWTH utilized
RWTH?s state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierar-
chical translation systems. GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003) was employed to train word alignments, lan-
guage models have been created with the SRILM
toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
2.1.1 Phrase-Based System
The phrase-based translation (PBT) system is
similar to the one described in Zens and Ney (2008).
After phrase pair extraction from the word-aligned
parallel corpus, the translation probabilities are esti-
mated by relative frequencies. The standard feature
322
set alo includes an n-gram language model, phrase-
level IBM-1 and word-, phrase- and distortion-
penalties, which are combined in log-linear fash-
ion. The model weights are optimized with standard
Mert (Och, 2003) on 200-best lists. The optimiza-
tion criterium is BLEU.
2.1.2 Hierarchical System
For the hierarchical setups (HPBT) described in
this paper, the open source Jane toolkit (Vilar et
al., 2010) is employed. Jane has been developed at
RWTH and implements the hierarchical approach as
introduced by Chiang (2007) with some state-of-the-
art extensions. In hierarchical phrase-based transla-
tion, a weighted synchronous context-free grammar
is induced from parallel text. In addition to contigu-
ous lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases with up to
two gaps are extracted. The search is typically car-
ried out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang
and Chiang, 2007). The model weights are opti-
mized with standard Mert (Och, 2003) on 100-best
lists. The optimization criterium is 4BLEU ?TER.
2.1.3 Preprocessing
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size
translation, the German text was preprocessed
by splitting German compound words with the
frequency-based method described in (Koehn and
Knight, 2003a). To further reduce translation com-
plexity for the phrase-based approach, we performed
the long-range part-of-speech based reordering rules
proposed by (Popovic? et al, 2006).
2.1.4 Language Model
For both decoders a 4-gram language model is ap-
plied. The language model is trained on the par-
allel data as well as the provided News crawl, the
109 French-English, UN and LDC Gigaword Fourth
Edition corpora. For the 109 French-English, UN
and LDC Gigaword corpora RWTH applied the data
selection technique described in (Moore and Lewis,
2010).
2.2 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Single
System
2.2.1 Preprocessing
We preprocess the training data prior to training
the system, first by normalizing symbols such as
quotes, dashes and apostrophes. Then smart-casing
of the first words of each sentence is performed. For
the German part of the training corpus we use the
hunspell1 lexicon to learn a mapping from old Ger-
man spelling to new German spelling to obtain a cor-
pus with homogenous spelling. In addition, we per-
form compound splitting as described in (Koehn and
Knight, 2003b). Finally, we remove very long sen-
tences, empty lines, and sentences that probably are
not parallel due to length mismatch.
2.2.2 System Overview
The KIT system uses an in-house phrase-based
decoder (Vogel, 2003) to perform translation and op-
timization with regard to the BLEU score is done us-
ing Minimum Error Rate Training as described in
Venugopal et al (2005).
2.2.3 Translation Models
The translation model is trained on the Europarl
and News Commentary Corpus and the phrase ta-
ble is based on a discriminative word alignment
(Niehues and Vogel, 2008).
In addition, the system applies a bilingual lan-
guage model (Niehues et al, 2011) to extend the
context of source language words available for trans-
lation.
Furthermore, we use a discriminative word lexi-
con as introduced in (Mauser et al, 2009). The lex-
icon was trained and integrated into our system as
described in (Mediani et al, 2011).
At last, we tried to find translations for
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by using quasi-
morphological operations as described in Niehues
and Waibel (2011). For each OOV word, we try to
find a related word that we can translate. We modify
the ending letters of the OOV word and learn quasi-
morphological operations to be performed on the
known translation of the related word to synthesize
a translation for the OOV word. By this approach
we were for example able to translate Kaminen into
chimneys using the known translation Kamin # chim-
ney.
2.2.4 Language Models
We use two 4-gram SRI language models, one
trained on the News Shuffle corpus and one trained
1http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/
323
on the Gigaword corpus. Furthermore, we use a 5-
gram cluster-based language model trained on the
News Shuffle corpus. The word clusters were cre-
ated using the MKCLS algorithm. We used 100
word clusters.
2.2.5 Reordering Model
Reordering is performed based on part-of-speech
tags obtained using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
Based on these tags we learn probabilistic continu-
ous (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007) and discontinuous
(Niehues and Kolss, 2009) rules to cover short and
long-range reorderings. The rules are learned from
the training corpus and the alignment. In addition,
we learned tree-based reordering rules. Therefore,
the training corpus was parsed by the Stanford parser
(Rafferty and Manning, 2008). The tree-based rules
consist of the head node of a subtree and all its
children as well as the new order and a probability.
These rules were applied recursively. The reordering
rules are applied to the source sentences and the re-
ordered sentence variants as well as the original se-
quence are encoded in a word lattice which is used
as input to the decoder. For the test sentences, the
reordering based on parts-of-speech and trees allows
us to change the word order in the source sentence
so that the sentence can be translated more easily.
In addition, we build reordering lattices for all train-
ing sentences and then extract phrase pairs from the
monotone source path as well as from the reordered
paths.
2.3 LIMSI-CNRS Single System
LIMSI?s system is built with n-code (Crego et al,
2011), an open source statistical machine translation
system based on bilingual n-gram2. In this approach,
the translation model relies on a specific decomposi-
tion of the joint probability of a sentence pair P(s, t)
using the n-gram assumption: a sentence pair is de-
composed into a sequence of bilingual units called
tuples, defining a joint segmentation of the source
and target. In the approach of (Marin?o et al, 2006),
this segmentation is a by-product of source reorder-
ing which ultimately derives from initial word and
phrase alignments.
2http://ncode.limsi.fr/
2.3.1 An Overview of n-code
The baseline translation model is implemented as
a stochastic finite-state transducer trained using a
n-gram model of (source,target) pairs (Casacuberta
and Vidal, 2004). Training this model requires to
reorder source sentences so as to match the target
word order. This is performed by a stochastic finite-
state reordering model, which uses part-of-speech
information3 to generalize reordering patterns be-
yond lexical regularities.
In addition to the translation model, eleven fea-
ture functions are combined: a target-language
model; four lexicon models; two lexicalized reorder-
ing models (Tillmann, 2004) aiming at predicting
the orientation of the next translation unit; a ?weak?
distance-based distortion model; and finally a word-
bonus model and a tuple-bonus model which com-
pensate for the system preference for short transla-
tions. The four lexicon models are similar to the ones
used in a standard phrase based system: two scores
correspond to the relative frequencies of the tuples
and two lexical weights estimated from the automat-
ically generated word alignments. The weights asso-
ciated to feature functions are optimally combined
using a discriminative training framework (Och,
2003), using the newstest2009 development set.
The overall search is based on a beam-search
strategy on top of a dynamic programming algo-
rithm. Reordering hypotheses are computed in a
preprocessing step, making use of reordering rules
built from the word reorderings introduced in the tu-
ple extraction process. The resulting reordering hy-
potheses are passed to the decoder in the form of
word lattices (Crego and Marin?o, 2007).
2.3.2 Continuous Space Translation Models
One critical issue with standard n-gram transla-
tion models is that the elementary units are bilingual
pairs, which means that the underlying vocabulary
can be quite large. Unfortunately, the parallel data
available to train these models are typically smaller
than the corresponding monolingual corpora used to
train target language models. It is very likely then,
that such models should face severe estimation prob-
lems. In such setting, using neural network language
3Part-of-speech labels for English and German are com-
puted using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995).
324
model techniques seem all the more appropriate. For
this study, we follow the recommendations of Le et
al. (2012), who propose to factor the joint proba-
bility of a sentence pair by decomposing tuples in
two (source and target) parts, and further each part
in words. This yields a word factored translation
model that can be estimated in a continuous space
using the SOUL architecture (Le et al, 2011).
The design and integration of a SOUL model for
large SMT tasks is far from easy, given the computa-
tional cost of computing n-gram probabilities. The
solution used here was to resort to a two pass ap-
proach: the first pass uses a conventional back-off
n-gram model to produce a k-best list; in the second
pass, the k-best list is reordered using the probabil-
ities of m-gram SOUL translation models. In the
following experiments, we used a fixed context size
for SOUL of m = 10, and used k = 300.
2.3.3 Corpora and Data Preprocessing
The parallel data is word-aligned using
MGIZA++4 with default settings. For the En-
glish monolingual training data, we used the same
setup as last year5 and thus the same target language
model as detailed in (Allauzen et al, 2011).
For English, we took advantage of our in-house
text processing tools for tokenization and detok-
enization steps (De?chelotte et al, 2008) and our sys-
tem was built in ?true-case?. As German is mor-
phologically more complex than English, the default
policy which consists in treating each word form
independently is plagued with data sparsity, which
is detrimental both at training and decoding time.
Thus, the German side was normalized using a spe-
cific pre-processing scheme (Allauzen et al, 2010;
Durgar El-Kahlout and Yvon, 2010), which notably
aims at reducing the lexical redundancy by (i) nor-
malizing the orthography, (ii) neutralizing most in-
flections and (iii) splitting complex compounds.
2.4 SYSTRAN Software, Inc. Single System
The data submitted by SYSTRAN were obtained by
a system composed of the standard SYSTRAN MT
engine in combination with a statistical post editing
(SPE) component.
4http://geek.kyloo.net/software
5The fifth edition of the English Gigaword (LDC2011T07)
was not used.
The SYSTRAN system is traditionally classi-
fied as a rule-based system. However, over the
decades, its development has always been driven by
pragmatic considerations, progressively integrating
many of the most efficient MT approaches and tech-
niques. Nowadays, the baseline engine can be con-
sidered as a linguistic-oriented system making use of
dependency analysis, general transfer rules as well
as of large manually encoded dictionaries (100k -
800k entries per language pair).
The SYSTRAN phrase-based SPE component
views the output of the rule-based system as the
source language, and the (human) reference trans-
lation as the target language, see (L. Dugast and
Koehn, 2007). It performs corrections and adaptions
learned from the 5-gram language model trained on
the parallel target-to-target corpus. Moreover, the
following measures - limiting unwanted statistical
effects - were applied:
? Named entities, time and numeric expressions
are replaced by special tokens on both sides.
This usually improves word alignment, since
the vocabulary size is significantly reduced. In
addition, entity translation is handled more re-
liably by the rule-based engine.
? The intersection of both vocabularies (i.e. vo-
cabularies of the rule-based output and the ref-
erence translation) is used to produce an addi-
tional parallel corpus to help to improve word
alignment.
? Singleton phrase pairs are deleted from the
phrase table to avoid overfitting.
? Phrase pairs not containing the same number
of entities on the source and the target side are
also discarded.
The SPE language model was trained on 2M bilin-
gual phrases from the news/Europarl corpora, pro-
vided as training data for WMT 2012. An addi-
tional language model built from 15M phrases of
the English LDC Gigaword corpus using Kneser-
Ney (Kneser and Ney, 1995) smoothing was added.
Weights for these separate models were tuned by
the Mert algorithm provided in the Moses toolkit
(P. Koehn et al, 2007), using the provided news de-
velopment set.

3 RWTH Aachen System Combination
System combination is used to produce consensus
translations from multiple hypotheses produced with
different translation engines that are better in terms
of translation quality than any of the individual hy-
potheses. The basic concept of RWTH?s approach
to machine translation system combination has been
described by Matusov et al (2006; 2008). This ap-
proach includes an enhanced alignment and reorder-
ing framework. A lattice is built from the input hy-
potheses. The translation with the best score within
the lattice according to a couple of statistical models
is selected as consensus translation.
4 Experiments
This year, we tried different sets of single systems
for system combination. As RWTH has two dif-
ferent translation systems, we put the output of
both systems into system combination. Although
both systems have the same preprocessing and lan-
guage model, their hypotheses differ because of
their different decoding approach. Compared to
the other systems, the system by SYSTRAN has a
completely different approach (see section 2.4). It
is mainly based on a rule-based system. For the
German?English pair, SYSTRAN achieves a lower
BLEU score in each test set compared to the other
groups. However, since the SYSTRAN system is
very different to the others, we still obtain an im-
provement when we add it also to system combina-
tion.
We did experiments with different optimization
criteria for the system combination optimization.
All results are listed in Table 1 (unoptimized), Table
2 (optimized on BLEU) and Table 3 (optimized on
TER-BLEU). Further, we investigated, whether we
will loose performance, if a single system is dropped
from the system combination. The results show that
for each optimization criteria we need all systems to
achieve the best results.
For the BLEU optimized system combination, we
obtain an improvement compared to the best sin-
gle systems for all dev sets. For newstest2008, we
get an improvement of 1.5 points in BLEU and 1.5
points in TER compared to the best single system of
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For newstest2009
we get an improvement of 1.9 points in BLEU and
1.5 points in TER compared to the best single sys-
tem. The system combination of all systems outper-
forms the best single system with 1.9 points in BLEU
and 1.9 points in TER for newstest2010. For new-
stest2011 the improvement is 1.3 points in BLEU
and 2.9 points in TER.
For the TER-BLEU optimized system combina-
tion, we achieved more improvement in TER com-
pared to the BLEU optimized system combination.
For newstest2008, we get an improvement of 0.8
points in BLEU and 3.0 points in TER compared to
the best single system of Karlsruhe Institute of Tech-
nology. The system combinations performs better
on newstest2009 with 1.3 points in BLEU and 2.7
points in TER. For newstest2010, we get an im-
provement of 1.7 points in BLEU and 3.4 points in
TER and for newstest2011 we get an improvement
of 0.7 points in BLEU and 2.5 points in TER.
5 Conclusion
The four statistical machine translation systems of
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, RWTH Aachen
and LIMSI and the very structural approach of SYS-
TRAN produce hypotheses with a huge variability
compared to the others. Finally, the RWTH Aachen
system combination combined all single system hy-
potheses to one hypothesis with a higher BLEU and
a lower TER score compared to each single sys-
tem. For each optimization criteria the system com-
binations using all single systems outperforms the
system combinations using one less single system.
Although the single system of SYSTRAN has the
worst error scores and the RWTH single systems are
similar, we achieved the best result in using all single
systems. For the WMT 12 evaluation, we submitted
the system combination of all systems optimized on
BLEU.
