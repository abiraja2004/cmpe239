Abstract
BiasML is a novel annotation scheme with
the purpose of identifying the presence as
well as nuances of biased language within
the subset of Wikipedia articles dedicated
to service providers. Whereas Wikipedia
currently uses only manual flagging to de-
tect possible bias, our scheme provides
a foundation for the automating of bias
flagging by improving upon the methodol-
ogy of annotation schemes in classic sen-
timent analysis. We also address chal-
lenges unique to the task of identifying
biased writing within the specific context
of Wikipedia?s neutrality policy. We per-
form a detailed analysis of inter-annotator
agreement, which shows that although the
agreement scores for intra-sentential tags
were relatively low, the agreement scores
on the sentence and entry levels were
encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respec-
tively). Based on an analysis of our first
implementation of our scheme, we suggest
possible improvements to our guidelines, in
hope that further rounds of annotation af-
ter incorporating them could provide ap-
propriate data for use within a machine
learning framework for automated detec-
tion of bias within Wikipedia.
1 Introduction
BiasML is an annotation scheme directed at de-
tecting bias in the Wikipedia pages of service
providers. Articles are judged as biased or non-
biased at the sentential and document levels,
and annotated on the intra-sentential level for
a number of lexical and structural features.
2 Motivation and Background
2.1 Motivation
Neutral Point of View (NPOV) is one of
three core tenets of Wikipedia?s content pol-
icy. Wikipedia describes NPOV as ?represent-
ing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possi-
ble without bias, all significant views that have
been published by reliable sources? (Wikipedia,
2011a).
The collaborative design of Wikipedia is such
that anyone can submit content, and so the de-
tection and flagging of bias within articles is
an essential and ongoing task in maintaining
the quality and utility of Wikipedia. Currently,
NPOV is enforced manually via the same open
process that creates content on the site. Users
can flag pages with suspect content as contain-
ing a ?NPOV dispute?. This is problematic:
definitions of bias vary from editor to editor,
and accusations of bias can themselves come
from a biased perspective. Additionally, this
practice is weighted towards the attention of
Wikipedia users, such that the scrutiny an ar-
ticle receives is proportional to its broader pop-
ularity. For example, though the pages for Land
of Israel and restaurant franchise Fresh to Or-
der have both been flagged for NPOV disputes,
they have been edited 1,480 and 46 times by 536
and 22 users, respectively (Wikipedia, 2011b;
Wikipedia, 2011c). The average Wikipedia page
receives just under 20 edits (Wikipedia, 2011d).
In light of this, an automated pass at bias de-
tection is highly desirable. Instead of wholesale
reliance on human editors, a system based on
our annotation scheme could serve as an initial
47
filter in monitoring user contributions. If inte-
grated into the Wikipedia framework, this sys-
tem could aid in the regulation of NPOV pol-
icy violations, e.g. tracking repeat offenders.
With this goal in mind we have designed Bi-
asML to flag NPOV issues in a specific subset
of Wikipedia articles. We have constrained our
task to the pages of service providers such as
small businesses, schools, and hospitals. As a
genre, the pages of service providers are espe-
cially worthy of scrutiny because they are both
less likely to be closely vetted, and more likely to
be edited by someone with a commercial interest
in the reputation of the organization.
In addition, service provider pages are partic-
ularly appropriate for automatic POV-flagging
because the bias complaints leveled against them
tend to be much more systematic and objective
compared with those of an especially controver-
sial or divisive topic.
2.2 Background
Sentiment analysis efforts usually rely on the
prior polarity of words (their polarity out of
context). For example, Turney (2002) pro-
poses a method to classify reviews as ?rec-
ommended?/?not recommended?, based on the
average semantic orientation of the review.
Semantic orientation is the mutual informa-
tion measure of selected phrases with the
word excellent minus their mutual information
with the word poor. However, as Wilson et
al. (2005) point out, even using a lexicon of pos-
itive/negative words marked for their prior po-
larity is merely a starting point, since a word?s
polarity in context might differ from its prior
polarity.
The distinction between prior and contextual
polarity is crucial for detecting bias, since words
with a prior positive/negative polarity may or
may not convey bias, depending on their con-
text. Notably, the inverse is also true - generally
neutral words can be used to create a favorable
tone towards a sentence?s topic, thereby express-
ing bias. An example of the latter case are the
words own and even in the sentence The hospi-
tal has its own pharmacy, maternity ward, and
even a morgue. Though generally neutral, their
usage here contributes to the sentence?s overall
non-neutrality. In order to deal with contex-
tual polarity, Wilson et al propose a two-stage
process that first uses clues marked with contex-
tual polarity to determine whether the phrases
containing these clues are polar or neutral. The
second stage then determines the actual polarity
of the phrases deemed non-neutral.
However, Wilson et al?s approach would not
suit our task of bias detection in Wikipedia,
as the abovementioned example, taken from a
Wikipedia entry, shows. Blatant expression of
opinions or emotions is rare in the Wikipedia
entries of service providers. Words which ex-
plicitly convey that an opinion/emotion is being
expressed are rarely used (e.g. I think). Rather,
bias is introduced either in more subtle ways
(e.g. using words that are usually neutral) or
in ways that differ from the ones addressed by
previous approaches. For example, bias is intro-
duced by preceding positive information about
the provided service by phrases such as it is
widely believed. Clearly, this phrase does not
have contextual polarity, but it does introduce
bias.
Within the realm of Wikipedia, phrases that
create an impression that something specific and
meaningful has been said when only a vague or
ambiguous claim has been communicated, such
as it is widely believed, are referred to as weasels
(Wikipedia, 2011e). The recent CoNLL-2010
shared task (Farkas et al, 2010), aimed at de-
tecting uncertainty cues in texts, focused on
these phrases in trying to determine whether
sentences contain uncertain information. In the
same vein, we include weasel words as part of
our annotation scheme to detect bias.
Finally, as Blitzer et al (2007) point out, al-
though the typical word-level analysis captures
the finer-grained aspects of sentiment language,
it falls short in capturing broader structurally or
contextually-based bias. Bias can also be intro-
duced by repetitive usage of words that in typ-
ical usage do not have prior polarity, but when
used in a repetitive manner, create a favorable
depiction of a sentence?s topic. This cannot be
captured by approaches such as those of Wilson
et al or Turney.
48
To tackle cases like those described above, our
annotation scheme extends beyond lexical tags,
and includes tags that capture dependencies be-
tween a word and its context, as well as tags
that are aimed at capturing subtle expressions
of bias.
3 Method
3.1 Corpus Selection and Preparation
The POV Wikipedia entries were selected from
Wikipedia?s list of entries that are classified as
?NPOV dispute?. Roughly 6,000 of the more
than 3 million existing Wikipedia entries have
been flagged this way (Wikipedia, 2011f). We
went over these entries using a ?get random ar-
ticle? feature, choosing ones that met our ser-
vice provider criterion, i.e., they were either
about a specific product or a service provider.
The neutral entries were selected via a search
through pages of products/service providers on
Wikipedia that were evaluated by us as neutral.
Our corpus ultimately consisted of 22 POV en-
tries and 11 NPOV ones.
3.2 Annotation Scheme
Annotation Procedure and Tags: The an-
notation was performed using the MAE anno-
tation tool (Stubbs, 2011), which is compliant
with LAF guidelines (Ide and Romary, 2006).
The annotation scheme uses standoff annota-
tion and includes tagging on multiple levels -
tagging biased words and linguistic structures;
tagging the neutrality of each sentence; tagging
the overall neutrality of the entry. The annota-
tor is instructed to read through each sentence,
and decide if it is written in a neutral point of
view or not. At this point in the annotation
process, a sentence is considered non-neutral if
it is written in a non-neutral tone, or if it fa-
vors/disfavors its topic (regardless of whether
the sentence is sourced). If a sentence is deemed
neutral, it is tagged with a sentential level tag
SENTENCE POV, with the attribute NPOV,
and no further tagging of it is required.
In the alternate case that a sentence is judged
to contain non-neutral language, the annotator
is asked to look for words/phrases that should be
tagged with the word/phrase level tags (elabo-
rated below) only within the scope of the current
sentence. After tagging the word/phrase level
tags, the sentence should be evaluated for its
neutrality, and tagged SENTENCE POV with
one of two possible attributes (POV or NPOV),
depending on the word/phrase level tags it has.
After all the sentences are tagged with the SEN-
TENCE POV tag, the entire entry is tagged
with the ENTRY POV tag, whose attribute val-
ues are numeric, ranging between 1 and 4, where
1 is completely neutral and 4 is clearly non-
neutral (i.e., written as an advertisement).
The annotation scheme is comprised of 4
word/phrase level extent tags that aim to cap-
ture biased language - POLAR PHRASE,
WEASEL, REPETITION, and PER-
SONAL TONE. The POLAR PHRASE tag is
used to mark words/phrases that are used to
express favor or disfavor within the sentential
context, and contribute to the non-neutrality
of the sentence. The annotator is advised
to examine whether replacing the suspected
word(s) results in a more neutral version of the
sentence, without losing any of the sentence?s
content. If so, the word(s) should be tagged as
POLAR PHRASE (with a positive or negative
attribute). For example, in the sentence The
new hospital even has a morgue, even is tagged
with the POLAR PHRASE tag (the attribute
value is positive), and the entire sentence?s
SENTENCE POV tag receives the attribute
POV.
The PERSONAL TONE tag is used to tag
words/phrases that convey a personal tone,
which is commonly used in advertisements but is
inappropriate in encyclopedic entries. The pos-
sible attribute values are first person (e.g. we,
our), second person (e.g. you, your) and other
(e.g. here). The REPETITION tag is used for
two possible cases - when similar words are un-
necessarily used to describe the same thing, all
words except the first one should be considered
a repetition; when there is unnecessary repeti-
tion that does not add new information (i.e., it
is not elaboration, but mere repetition) about
the service the service provider offers, or praise
of the service provider, the repeated elements
49
Figure 1: An annotated Wikipedia entry - POLAR PHRASEs are underlined in bold, all of the positive
type; WEASEL is italicized, and is of the pro type; REPETITION is underlined, receiving the attribute
value 3. SENTENCE POV for sentences no. 1, 2, 5 & 6 is NPOV, while it is POV for sentences no. 3 & 4.
The ENTRY POV is 3, which corresponds to POV.
should be considered repetition. For both cases,
the attribute value will be the numeric value rep-
resenting the number of repeated elements. To
illustrate the former type of REPETITION and
the PERSONAL TONE tag, consider the sen-
tence The councils work to enhance and improve
the quality of your local health service. Im-
prove is a case of REPETITION, since there is
no need for both enhance and improve (the at-
tribute value is 1). In addition, your is tagged
with the PERSONAL TONE tag (second per-
son), and the sentence?s SENTENCE POV tag
receives the attribute POV. The other type of
REPETITION applies to cases where a sentence
such as The funeral home also offers a flower
shop, crematorium, family center and library,
is subsequently followed by a sentence such as
This unique funeral home is built of natural
limestone, and has a modern cremation center,
a family center and library, a flower shop and a
chapel. While unique is tagged as a PO-
LAR PHRASE, the other underlined elements
are all REPETITION, with the attribute value
set to 3, since 3 elements are repeated unnec-
essarily, without adding new information. Note
that although crematorium and cremation cen-
ter refer to the same entity, it is not treated as
a repetition, because the second mention adds
that it is a modern crematorium. The second
sentence?s neutrality is therefore POV, while the
first one?s is NPOV.
As elaborated in the background section,
weasel words also introduce bias, by presenting
the appearance of support for statements while
denying the reader the possibility to assess the
viewpoint?s source. These are usually general
claims about what people think or feel, or what
has been shown. These words/phrases are cap-
tured by the WEASEL tag. This tag has two
possible attributes, pro, which captures ?classic?
WEASELs such as is often credited, and con,
which would capture negative portrayal, as in is
never believed. In contrast to the previously de-
scribed word/phrase level tags, we also included
a fifth tag, FACTIVE PHRASE, which is inher-
ently different. It is used to mark phrases that
give objectivity to what is otherwise a biased
description, usually a source. These phrases de-
bias polar phrases and weasels.
The relation between a FACTIVE PHRASE
and the POLAR PHRASE or WEASEL that
it de-biases is captured by the LEGITIMIZE
link tag. A sentence that was initially judged
as non-neutral can eventually be tagged as
NPOV, if each instance of its biased language
is backed up by sources. Otherwise, it should
be tagged as POV. For example, in the sentence
It is widely believed that John Smith started the
tradition of pro-bono work.[1], the phrase is
widely believed is tagged WEASEL, whereas [1]
is tagged FACTIVE PHRASE. In addition, a
LEGITIMIZE tag will link these two elements,
50
resulting in an overall neutral sentence, since
its biased language is backed up by a source.
The SENTENCE POV tag will therefore have
the attribute value NPOV (whereas it would be
POV if there were no FACTIVE PHRASE). To
further illustrate this point, consider the sen-
tence Jones and Sons ranked number one in
The American Lawyer?s Annual Survey. Num-
ber one is tagged as a POLAR PHRASE (pos-
itive), The American Lawyer?s Annual Survey
is a FACTIVE PHRASE, and there is a LE-
GITIMIZE link between them. The entire
SENTENCE POV tag?s neutrality is therefore
NPOV. This is in contrast to the sentence
Jones and Sons are the number one law firm in
Boston., which would have the attribute value
POV, because its polar phrases have no factive
phrase to back them up. Our framework also
enables tagging a sentence as POV even if none
of the possible tags apply to them. See Figure 1
for an example of an annotated entry.
BiasML Innovations: The annotation scheme
elaborated above is an innovative yet practi-
cal answer to the theoretical linguistic consid-
erations of sentiment analysis within the genre
of Wikipedia. As previously mentioned, our
scheme improves upon approaches that rely
upon prior polarity (e.g. Turney, 2002) by
identifying cases of biased language that stem
from intra-sentential and cross-sentential de-
pendencies, rather than isolated words. Our
POLAR PHRASE tag resembles phrases with
non-neutral contextual polarity that Wilson et
al.?s (2005) approach introduces, but it captures
cases that their approach does not - namely, gen-
erally neutral words that nevertheless make a
sentence biased.
Another innovation of our framework is
enabling the legitimization of weasel words.
Whereas the CoNLL-2010 shared task (Farkas
et al, 2010) annotated all occurrences of weasels
as uncertainty markers, we acknowledge the pos-
sibility of sources (e.g. citations) that actually
nullify the weasel.
The multiple-level discourse association of our
tag scheme also allows observation of shifts in
polarity within the larger discourse of the arti-
cle. The sentence-level POV tag allows the an-
notator to identify the overall neutrality of each
sentence, thus producing a landscape of how bi-
ased language is distributed across the article.
This landscape not only provides an indicator of
where to look for contextual clues and dependen-
cies among more local tags, but it is particularly
relevant to Wikipedia?s wiki platform, where it is
likely that different authors contributed to dif-
ferent portions of the article, making it more
prone to variance in biased tone.
While developing this scheme, we wanted to
make sure it tapped into the capacity of the
annotator to identify both subjective language
use and objective linguistic phenomena. While
tags like PERSONAL TONE and WEASEL re-
quire the annotator to mark precise occurrences
of language, the sentence and document-level
POV tags allow the annotator to identify point
of view without having to explicitly point to
a specific linguistic structure. To preserve the
value of the human annotator?s subjective judg-
ments, our scheme permitted the co-occurrence
of a sentence or document POV tag with the ab-
sence of any local lexical tags. This allowed our
scheme to recognize the difficult cases in senti-
ment analysis where one intuitively senses opin-
ionated language, but is unable to formally de-
fine what makes it so.
Another aim of our work was to develop a
scheme that captured the way information is
portrayed in Wikipedia, while avoiding judg-
ment on what information is actually commu-
nicated. A significant source of dispute within
Wikipedia is disagreement as to the veracity
of an article?s content; however, identification
of this is truly a different task then the one
we have defined here. In order to tease apart
these distinct types of evaluation, annotators
were instructed to identify citations that legit-
imize statements that are potentially POV, but
not to consider the truthfulness of the statement
or validity of the source when tagging.
4 Results
Our corpus of 33 articles of varying degrees of
neutrality was distributed among three annota-
tors, each annotator receiving 2/3 of the entire
51
corpus. The articles were presented as plain
text in the annotation environment, and were
stripped of images, titles, section headings, or
other information extraneous to the main body
of the text (inline references, however, were pre-
served). The annotators were graduate linguis-
tics students. Their training consisted of a brief
information session on the motivation of our
work, a set of annotation guidelines, and op-
tional question and answer sessions. Adjudica-
tion of the annotation was performed with the
MAI adjudication tool (Stubbs, 2011).
4.1 Tag Analysis
For each tag, an average percent agreement score
was calculated (for extents and attributes) per
document, then averaged to get the agreement
over all documents in the corpus. Note that ex-
tent agreement was defined as strictly as possi-
ble, requiring an exact character index match,
meaning cases of overlap would not be consid-
ered agreement (e.g. best and the best would not
be a match, even if they referred to the same
instance of best). The percent agreement scores
are displayed in Table 1. Note that calculations
were not performed for the LEGITMIZE link
tag, because it relies on the extent of other tags.
Tag % Extent Agreement % Attribute Agreement
POLAR PHRASE 6.5 60
FACTIVE PHRASE 9.3 NA
WEASEL 4.9 13.6
REPETITION 0 0
PERSONAL TONE 33 57.1
SENTENCE POV 94.6 74.8
ENTRY POV 97 66.7
Table 1: Tag Analysis of IAA: Mean % Agreement
Agreement is notably stronger among the
higher level tags, ENTRY POV and SEN-
TENCE POV. For the ENTRY POV neutral-
ity attribute, we had decided to measure over-
all Entry POV neutrality along a 4-point scale,
after noticing our own hesitation to assign the
same tag to both slightly preferential and fla-
grantly biased entries. However, this more nu-
anced system was at odds with our original ob-
jective of creating an annotation scheme for use
in a binary classification of bias. Though it
might manifest to different degrees, bias either
is or is not present within an entry. Our inten-
tion in collapsing the scale after the fact was to
recover a more organic division in Entry POV
judgments. With the built-in 4-way division,
inter-annotator agreement on Entry POV at-
tributes stood at 42.42%. This number rose
considerably when the scale was reduced to a
2-way division. To reflect the notion that any
bias is unacceptable, we chose to divide EN-
TRY POV into two groups: not-at-all-biased
(ENTRY POV=1) and containing bias (EN-
TRY POV>1). This division yielded an inter-
annotator agreement of 66.7%. In the case of
the SENTENCE POV attribute, which is bi-
nary, agreement on neutrality is even higher at
74.8%.
The strength of scores for attributes at the
sentence and document levels suggest that an-
notators had similar perceptions of what kinds
of discourse entailed a bias not fit for an ency-
clopedic entry. This in turn suggests that there
is conceptual validity in our task on a higher
level, as well as validity in how that concept was
defined and conveyed to annotators.
Interestingly, agreement numbers decline
for the intra-sentential tags. Both PO-
LAR PHRASE and PERSONAL TONE have
attribute agreement scores at or near 60%, but
PERSONAL TONE has an extent agreement of
33%, while POLAR PHRASE has only 6.5% for
extent. WEASEL and REPETITION have low
scores for both extent and attribute, with REP-
ETITION being 0% for both (note that extent
agreement is a prerequisite for attribute agree-
ment). FACTIVE PHRASE also has low extent
agreement, making extent agreement generally
low across the board for intra-sentential tags.
Attribute agreement is expected to be high for
the intra-sentential tags, given that attributes
are almost always positive (pro/positive) within
the service provider genre. Based on the ad-
judication process, we suspect that the main
contributor to instances of attribute disagree-
ment for these tags was simply a failure
52
on the annotators? part to specify the at-
tribute at all, perhaps because they encoun-
tered mainly positive/pro instances of PO-
LAR PHRASEs/WEASELs, thereby forgetting
that an attribute is relevant. The annotators
also reported confusion about cases where a gen-
erally negative word/phrase is used to support
or promote the article?s topic (in these cases, the
attribute should be positive).
For POLAR PHRASE, the lack of extent
agreement is not entirely unexpected, as this
tag was difficult to define. As previously dis-
cussed, we chose not to use a lexicon of pos-
itive/negative words with their prior polarity,
because a word?s polarity in these documents
was highly contingent upon its context and par-
ticular usage. During adjudication, it was ob-
served that one of the annotators consistently
marked any term that was generally positive as a
POLAR PHRASE. For example, the word mod-
ern was chosen when used to describe architec-
ture. Although this word has some sort of posi-
tive connotation, it does not meet the substitu-
tion criteria outlined for POLAR PHRASE in
the guidelines (for a word to qualify as a PO-
LAR PHRASE, there should be a comparable
substitution possible that would reduce the non-
neutrality of the sentence without losing any of
its content). This annotator had set his/her ac-
ceptability threshold for this tag too low, which
resulted in over-selection. This could hopefully
be avoided in future annotation efforts by more
exposure to correct and incorrect examples of
polar phrases.
Low extent agreement for the WEASEL and
REPETITION tags appears to be a result of a
poor understanding of what the tags are meant
to capture. In the case of the WEASEL tag, an-
notators tended to mark anything that had an
obscured source, such as, being overlooked for
the position and a number of executives. Al-
though the passive voice in the first example
and the vague specification in the second one
do obscure a source, they do not present sup-
port for the topic at hand, which is part of the
WEASEL definition. To aid future annotation,
it appears that further emphasis is needed to
convey the fact that a WEASEL consists of a
targeted word/phrase (and not just a lack of ci-
tation) that is used to conceal the source of a
favorable or unfavorable statement. A lexicon
would be useful in this case, as most weasels are
covered by just a handful of common phrases or
constructions. For example, the famous is a
common WEASEL that was missed by all anno-
tators throughout the corpus.
The poor performance for the REPETITION
tag is probably a result of it not being just lit-
eral echo, but rather a recurrence of informa-
tion used for promotional purposes. Like PO-
LAR PHRASE, this makes its definition rather
subjective, and thus prone to different inter-
pretations. Throughout the corpus, all annota-
tors tended to miss the REPETITION we had
identified in the gold standard, and there were
also cases of annotators marking literal repeti-
tions that did not match the guidelines? crite-
ria. Although the linguistic phenomenon that
the REPETITION tag was intended to capture
is indeed indicative of bias (especially for ser-
vice provider articles), it is relatively rare. Its
rarity and elusiveness, combined with the fact
that agreement was 0%, would motivate us to
exclude this as a tag in future versions of the
annotation scheme.
4.2 Annotator Analysis
Table 2 reports how each annotator compares
to the gold standard (which was determined
by the authors). Overall, annotator B clearly
outperformed the other two, with both strong
precision and recall scores. For all the intra-
sentential tags with the exception of WEASEL,
there seems to be a consistent trend where an-
notator B has the highest scores, a second an-
notator has somewhat lower scores (either A or
C), and the third one has very low scores. This
trend suggests that for each of these tags, a sin-
gle annotator tended to pull down its agreement
scores, though not consistently the same anno-
tator. For example, annotator C performed rela-
tively poorly on FACTIVE PHRASE and PER-
SONAL TONE, while the same was true for an-
notator A on the POLAR PHRASE and REP-
ETITION tags. For the higher level tags (SEN-
TENCE POV and ENTRY POV), performance
53
was excellent for all annotators, which is con-
sistent with the percent agreement scores from
Table 1.
Tag annotator a annotator b annotator c
pre., rec. pre., rec. pre., rec.
POLAR PHRASE 0.2, 0.28 0.63, 0.89 0.55, 0.17
FACTIVE PHRASE 0.29, 0.5 0.55, 0.86 0, 0
WEASEL 0.33, 0.28 0.85, 0.92 0.33, 0.6
REPETITION 0.06, 0.08 0.62, 1 0.44, 0.36
PERSONAL TONE 0.64, 0.39 1, 1 0, 0
SENTENCE POV 1, 0.97 1, 1 0.98, 0.97
ENTRY POV 1, 1 1, 1 1, 1
Table 2: Per-Annotator Analysis: Precision and Re-
call
While the low individual scores on intra-
sentential tags is disconcerting, the overall
higher scores for annotator B are a positive indi-
cation that a decent understanding and execu-
tion of the scheme and guidelines are possible,
and agreement could potentially improve greatly
with better training for adherence to the guide-
lines in the case of the other two annotators.
4.3 Proposed Annotation Changes
Post-annotation analyses have provided a basis
for changes to our annotation scheme, guide-
lines, and implementation process for the fu-
ture. In addition to the changes to the guide-
lines we have suggested in the previous section,
we believe that the greatest amount of improve-
ment for our tag agreement could be achieved by
conducting a training session for annotators, in
which they study and then practice with positive
and negative examples of the different tags. This
would hopefully solidify understanding of the
tagging scheme, since it became apparent during
comparison with the gold standard that certain
annotators had trouble with specific tags. Fur-
thermore, it would be worth experimenting with
less rigorous forms of extent matching, and per-
haps allowing extents with a certain degree of
overlap to qualify as agreement.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
The work presented here offers a new annotation
scheme for the automatic detection of bias in the
unique genre of Wikipedia entries. In addition
to a tagset designed to identify linguistic charac-
teristics associated with bias within an encyclo-
pedic corpus, our scheme works beyond typical
sentiment analysis approaches to capture cross-
sentential linguistic phenomena that lead to en-
cyclopedia bias. Strong agreement results for
sentence and document levels bias tags (74.8%
and 66.7%, respectively) indicate that there is
conceptual validity in our task on a higher level,
as well as validity in how that concept was de-
fined and conveyed to annotators. While agree-
ment for intra-sentential tags was lower, the fact
that one annotator consistently scored high on
agreement with the gold standard suggests that
improved annotator training, and specification
of unforeseen cases in the guidelines would pro-
vide more reliable annotator performance for
these tags. It is our hope that upon implement-
ing the suggested improvements outlined in this
work, further rounds of annotation could pro-
vide appropriate data for use within a machine
learning framework for automated detection of
various sorts of bias within Wikipedia.
