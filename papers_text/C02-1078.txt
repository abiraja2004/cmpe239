Abstract
This paper proposes a method to analyze
Japanese anaphora, in which zero pronouns
(omitted obligatory cases) are used to refer to
preceding entities (antecedents). Unlike the
case of general coreference resolution, zero pro-
nouns have to be detected prior to resolution
because they are not expressed in discourse.
Our method integrates two probability param-
eters to perform zero pronoun detection and
resolution in a single framework. The first pa-
rameter quantifies the degree to which a given
case is a zero pronoun. The second parame-
ter quantifies the degree to which a given entity
is the antecedent for a detected zero pronoun.
To compute these parameters efficiently, we use
corpora with/without annotations of anaphoric
relations. We show the effectiveness of our
method by way of experiments.
1 Introduction
Anaphora resolution is crucial in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP), specifically, discourse
analysis. In the case of English, partially mo-
tivated by Message Understanding Conferences
(MUCs) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), a
number of coreference resolution methods have
been proposed.
In other languages such as Japanese and
Spanish, anaphoric expressions are often omit-
ted. Ellipses related to obligatory cases are usu-
ally termed zero pronouns. Since zero pronouns
are not expressed in discourse, they have to be
detected prior to identifying their antecedents.
Thus, although in English pleonastic pronouns
have to be determined whether or not they are
anaphoric expressions prior to resolution, the
process of analyzing Japanese zero pronouns is
different from general coreference resolution in
English.
For identifying anaphoric relations, existing
methods are classified into two fundamental ap-
proaches: rule-based and statistical approaches.
In rule-based approaches (Grosz et al, 1995;
Hobbs, 1978; Mitkov et al, 1998; Nakaiwa
and Shirai, 1996; Okumura and Tamura, 1996;
Palomar et al, 2001; Walker et al, 1994),
anaphoric relations between anaphors and their
antecedents are identified by way of hand-
crafted rules, which typically rely on syntactic
structures, gender/number agreement, and se-
lectional restrictions. However, it is difficult to
produce rules exhaustively, and rules that are
developed for a specific language are not neces-
sarily effective for other languages. For exam-
ple, gender/number agreement in English can-
not be applied to Japanese.
Statistical approaches (Aone and Bennett,
1995; Ge et al, 1998; Kim and Ehara,
1995; Soon et al, 2001) use statistical mod-
els produced based on corpora annotated with
anaphoric relations. However, only a few
attempts have been made in corpus-based
anaphora resolution for Japanese zero pro-
nouns. One of the reasons is that it is costly
to produce a sufficient volume of training cor-
pora annotated with anaphoric relations.
In addition, those above methods focused
mainly on identifying antecedents, and few at-
tempts have been made to detect zero pronouns.
Motivated by the above background, we
propose a probabilistic model for analyzing
Japanese zero pronouns combined with a detec-
tion method. In brief, our model consists of two
parameters associated with zero pronoun detec-
tion and antecedent identification. We focus on
zero pronouns whose antecedents exist in pre-
ceding sentences to zero pronouns because they
are major referential expressions in Japanese.
Section 2 explains our proposed method (sys-
tem) for analyzing Japanese zero pronouns.
Section 3 evaluates our method by way of ex-
periments using newspaper articles. Section 4
discusses related research literature.
2 A System for Analyzing Japanese
Zero Pronouns
2.1 Overview
Figure 1 depicts the overall design of our system
to analyze Japanese zero pronouns. We explain
the entire process based on this figure.
First, given an input Japanese text, our sys-
tem performs morphological and syntactic anal-
yses. In the case of Japanese, morphological
analysis involves word segmentation and part-
of-speech tagging because Japanese sentences
lack lexical segmentation, for which we use
the JUMAN morphological analyzer (Kurohashi
and Nagao, 1998b). Then, we use the KNP
parser (Kurohashi, 1998) to identify syntactic
relations between segmented words.
Second, in a zero pronoun detection phase,
the system uses syntactic relations to detect
omitted cases (nominative, accusative, and da-
tive) as zero pronoun candidates. To avoid zero
pronouns overdetected, we use the IPAL verb
dictionary (Information-technology Promotion
Agency, 1987) including case frames associated
with 911 Japanese verbs. We discard zero pro-
noun candidates unlisted in the case frames as-
sociated with a verb in question.
For verbs unlisted in the IPAL dictionary,
only nominative cases are regarded as obliga-
tory. The system also computes a probability
that case c related to target verb v is a zero
pronoun, P
zero
(c|v), to select plausible zero pro-
noun candidates.
Ideally, in the case where a verb in ques-
tion is polysemous, word sense disambiguation
is needed to select the appropriate case frame,
because different verb senses often correspond
to different case frames. However, we currently
merge multiple case frames for a verb into a sin-
gle frame so as to avoid the polysemous prob-
lem. This issue needs to be further explored.
Third, in a zero pronoun resolution (i.e., an-
tecedent identification) phase, for each zero pro-
noun the system extracts antecedent candidates
from the preceding contexts, which are ordered
according to the extent to which they can be the
antecedent for the target zero pronoun. From

the viewpoint of probability theory, our task
here is to compute a probability that zero pro-
noun ? refers to antecedent a
i
, P (a
i
|?), and se-
lect the candidate that maximizes the probabil-
ity score. For the purpose of computing this
score, we model zero pronouns and antecedents
in Section 2.2.
Finally, the system outputs texts containing
anaphoric relations. In addition, the number
of zero pronouns analyzed by the system can
optionally be controlled based on the certainty
score described in Section 2.4.
2.2 Modeling Zero Pronouns and
Antecedents
According to past literature associated with
zero pronoun resolution and our preliminary
study, we use the following six features to model
zero pronouns and antecedents.
? Features for zero pronouns
? Verbs that govern zero pronouns (v), which
denote verbs whose cases are omitted.
? Surface cases related to zero pronouns (c),
for which possible values are Japanese case
marker suffixes, ga (nominative), wo (ac-
cusative), and ni (dative). Those values
indicate which cases are omitted.
? Features for antecedents
? Post-positional particles (p), which play
crucial roles in resolving Japanese zero pro-
nouns (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al,
1994).
? Distance (d), which denotes the distance
(proximity) between a zero pronoun and an
antecedent candidate in an input text. In
the case where they occur in the same sen-
tence, its value takes 0. In the case where
an antecedent occurs in n sentences previ-
ous to the sentence including a zero pro-
noun, its value takes n.
? Constraint related to relative clauses (r),
which denotes whether an antecedent is in-
cluded in a relative clause or not. In the
case where it is included, the value of r
takes true, otherwise false. The rationale
behind this feature is that Japanese zero
pronouns tend not to refer to noun phrases
in relative clauses.
? Semantic classes (n), which represent se-
mantic classes associated with antecedents.
We use 544 semantic classes defined in the
Japanese Bunruigoihyou thesaurus (Na-
tional Language Research Institute, 1964),
which contains 55,443 Japanese nouns.
2.3 Our Probabilistic Model for Zero
Pronoun Detection and Resolution
We consider probabilities that unsatisfied case
c related to verb v is a zero pronoun, P
zero
(c|v),
and that zero pronoun ?
c
refers to antecedent
a
i
, P (a
i
|?
c
). Thus, a probability that case c (?
c
)
is zero-pronominalized and refers to candidate
a
i
is formalized as in Equation (1).
P (a
i
|?
c
) ? P
zero
(c|v) (1)
Here, P
zero
(c|v) and P (a
i
|?
c
) are computed in
the detection and resolution phases, respec-
tively (see Figure 1).
Since zero pronouns are omitted obligatory
cases, whether or not case c is a zero pronoun
depends on the extent to which case c is oblig-
atory for verb v. Case c is likely to be oblig-
atory for verb v if c frequently co-occurs with
v. Thus, we compute P
zero
(c|v) based on the
co-occurrence frequency of ?v, c? pairs, which
can be extracted from unannotated corpora.
P
zero
(c|v) takes 1 in the case where c is ga (nom-
inative) regardless of the target verb, because ga
is obligatory for most Japanese verbs.
Given the formal representation for zero pro-
nouns and antecedents in Section 2.2, the prob-
ability, P (a|?), is expressed as in Equation (2).
P (a
i
|?) = P (p
i
, d
i
, r
i
, n
i
|v, c) (2)
To improve the efficiency of probability estima-
tion, we decompose the right-hand side of Equa-
tion (2) as follows.
Since a preliminary study showed that d
i
and
r
i
were relatively independent of the other fea-
tures, we approximate Equation (2) as in Equa-
tion (3).
P (a
i
|?) ? P (p
i
, n
i
|v, c) ? P (d
i
) ? P (r
i
)
= P (p
i
|n
i
, v, c) ? P (n
i
|v, c)
? P (d
i
) ? P (r
i
)
(3)
Given that p
i
is independent of v and n
i
, we
can further approximate Equation (3) to derive
Equation (4).
P (a
i
|?
c
) ? P (p
i
|c)?P (d
i
)?P (r
i
)?P (n
i
|v, c) (4)
Here, the first three factors, P (p
i
|c) ? P (d
i
) ?
P (r
i
), are related to syntactic properties, and
P (n
i
|v, c) is a semantic property associated with
zero pronouns and antecedents. We shall call
the former and latter ?syntactic? and ?seman-
tic? models, respectively.
Each parameter in Equation (4) is com-
puted as in Equations (5), where F (x) denotes
the frequency of x in corpora annotated with
anaphoric relations.
P (p
i
|c) =
F (p
i
, c)
?
j
F (p

, c)
P (d

) =

)
P (n
i
|v, c) =
F (n
i
, v, c)

, v, c)
(5)
However, since estimating a semantic model,
P (n
i
|v, c), needs large-scale annotated corpora,
the data sparseness problem is crucial. Thus,
we explore the use of unannotated corpora.
For P (n
i
|v, c), v and c are features for a zero
pronoun, and n
i
is a feature for an antecedent.
However, we can regard v, c, and n
i
as features
for a verb and its case noun because zero pro-
nouns are omitted case nouns. Thus, it is pos-
sible to estimate the probability based on co-
occurrences of verbs and their case nouns, which
can be extracted automatically from large-scale
unannotated corpora.
2.4 Computing Certainty Score
Since zero pronoun analysis is not a stand-alone
application, our system is used as a module in
other NLP applications, such as machine trans-
lation. In those applications, it is desirable that
erroneous anaphoric relations are not generated.
Thus, we propose a notion of certainty to out-
put only zero pronouns that are detected and
resolved with a high certainty score.
We formalize the certainty score, C(?
c
), for
each zero pronoun as in Equation (6), where
P
1
(?
c
) and P
2
(?
c
) denote probabilities com-
puted by Equation (1) for the first and second
ranked candidates, respectively. In addition, t is
a parametric constant, which is experimentally
set to 0.5.
C(?
c
) = t?P
1
(?
c
) + (1?t)(P
1
(?
c
)?P
2
(?
c
)) (6)
The certainty score becomes great in the case
where P
1
(?
c
) is sufficiently great and signifi-
cantly greater than P
2
(?
c
).
3 Evaluation
3.1 Methodology
To investigate the performance of our system,
we used Kyotodaigaku Text Corpus version
2.0 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998a), in which
20,000 articles in Mainichi Shimbun newspaper
articles in 1995 were analyzed by JUMAN and
KNP (i.e., the morph/syntax analyzers used in
our system) and revised manually. From this
corpus, we randomly selected 30 general articles
(e.g., politics and sports) and manually anno-
tated those articles with anaphoric relations for
zero pronouns. The number of zero pronouns
contained in those articles was 449.
We used a leave-one-out cross-validation eval-
uation method: we conducted 30 trials in each
of which one article was used as a test input
and the remaining 29 articles were used for pro-
ducing a syntactic model. We used six years
worth of Mainichi Shimbun newspaper arti-
cles (Mainichi Shimbunsha, 1994?1999) to pro-
duce a semantic model based on co-occurrences
of verbs and their case nouns.
To extract verbs and their case noun pairs
from newspaper articles, we performed a mor-
phological analysis by JUMAN and extracted
dependency relations using a relatively simple
rule: we assumed that each noun modifies the
verb of highest proximity. As a result, we
obtained 12 million co-occurrences associated
with 6,194 verb types. Then, we generalized
the extracted nouns into semantic classes in
the Japanese Bunruigoihyou thesaurus. In the
case where a noun was associated with multiple
classes, the noun was assigned to all possible
classes. In the case where a noun was not listed
in the thesaurus, the noun itself was regarded
as a single semantic class.
3.2 Comparative Experiments
Fundamentally, our evaluation is two-fold: we
evaluated only zero pronoun resolution (an-
tecedent identification) and a combination of
detection and resolution. In the former case,
we assumed that all the zero pronouns are cor-
rectly detected, and investigated the effective-
ness of the resolution model, P (a
i
|?). In the
latter case, we investigated the effectiveness of
the combined model, P (a
i
|?
c
) ? P
zero
(c|v).
First, we compared the performance of the
following different models for zero pronoun res-
olution, P (a
i
|?):
? a semantic model produced based on anno-
tated corpora (Sem1),
? a semantic model produced based on unan-
notated corpora, using co-occurrences of
verbs and their case nouns (Sem2),
? a syntactic model (Syn),
? a combination of Syn and Sem1 (Both1),
? a combination of Syn and Sem2 (Both2),
which is our complete model for zero pro-
noun resolution,
? a rule-based model (Rule).
As a control (baseline) model, we took approxi-
mately two man-months to develop a rule-based
model (Rule) through an analysis on ten articles
in Kyotodaigaku Text Corpus. This model uses
rules typically used in existing rule-based meth-
ods: 1) post-positional particles that follow an-
tecedent candidates, 2) proximity between zero
pronouns and antecedent candidates, and 3)
conjunctive particles. We did not use seman-
tic properties in the rule-based method because
they decreased the system accuracy in a prelim-
inary study.
Table 1: Experimental results for zero pronoun resolution.

2 46 (11.4%) 193 (47.8%) 227 (56.2%) 49 (12.1%) 250 (61.9%) 213 (52.7%)
3 72 (17.8%) 230 (56.9%) 262 (64.9%) 75 (18.6%) 280 (69.3%) 237 (58.6%)
Table 1 shows the results, where we regarded
the k-best antecedent candidates as the final
output and compared results for different values
of k. In the case where the correct answer was
included in the k-best candidates, we judged it
correct. In addition, ?Accuracy? is the ratio be-
tween the number of zero pronouns whose an-
tecedents were correctly identified and the num-
ber of zero pronouns correctly detected by the
system (404 for all the models). Bold figures
denote the highest performance for each value
of k across different models. Here, the average
number of antecedent candidates per zero pro-
noun was 27 regardless of the model, and thus
the accuracy was 3.7% in the case where the
system randomly selected antecedents.
Looking at the results for two different seman-
tic models, Sem2 outperformed Sem1, which
indicates that the use of co-occurrences of verbs
and their case nouns was effective to identify
antecedents and avoid the data sparseness prob-
lem in producing a semantic model.
The syntactic model, Syn, outperformed the
two semantic models independently, and there-
fore the syntactic features used in our model
were more effective than the semantic features
to identify antecedents. When both syntactic
and semantic models were used in Both2, the
accuracy was further improved. While the rule-
based method, Rule, achieved a relatively high
accuracy, our complete model, Both2, outper-
formed Rule irrespective of the value of k. To
sum up, we conclude that both syntactic and
semantic models were effective to identify ap-
propriate anaphoric relations.
At the same time, since our method requires
annotated corpora, the relation between the
corpus size and accuracy is crucial. Thus, we
performed two additional experiments associ-
ated with Both2.
In the first experiment, we varied the number
of annotated articles used to produce a syntactic
model, where a semantic model was produced

In the second experiment, we varied the num-
ber of unannotated articles used to produce a
semantic model, where a syntactic model was
produced based on 29 annotated articles. In
Figure 2, we show two independent results as
space is limited: the dashed and solid graphs
correspond to the results of the first and second
experiments, respectively. Given all the articles
for modeling, the resultant accuracy for each ex-
periment was 50.7%, which corresponds to that
for Both2 with k = 1 in Table 1.
In the case where the number of articles was
varied in producing a syntactic model, the ac-
curacy improved rapidly in the first five arti-
cles. This indicates that a high accuracy can
be obtained by a relatively small number of su-
pervised articles. In the case where the amount
of unannotated corpora was varied in produc-
ing a semantic model, the accuracy marginally
improved as the corpus size increases. However,
note that we do not need human supervision to
produce a semantic model.

tribution of the detection model, P

(c|v), we
used P (a

c
) for comparison. Both cases used
Both2 to compute the probability for zero pro-
noun resolution. We varied a threshold for the
certainty score to plot coverage-accuracy graphs
for zero pronoun detection (Figure 3) and an-
tecedent identification (Figure 4).
In Figure 3, ?coverage? is the ratio between
the number of zero pronouns correctly detected
by the system and the total number of zero pro-
nouns in input texts, and ?accuracy? is the ratio
between the number of zero pronouns correctly
detected and the total number of zero pronouns
detected by the system. Note that since our sys-
tem failed to detect a number of zero pronouns,
the coverage could not be 100%.
Figure 3 shows that as the coverage decreases,
the accuracy improved irrespective of the model
used. When compared with the case of P (a
i
|?),
our model, P (a
i
|?)?P
zero
(c|v), achieved a higher
accuracy regardless of the coverage.
In Figure 4, ?coverage? is the ratio between
the number of zero pronouns whose antecedents
were generated and the number of zero pro-
nouns correctly detected by the system. The
accuracy was improved by decreasing the cov-
erage, and our model marginally improved the
accuracy for P (a
i
|?).
According to those above results, our model
was effective to improve the accuracy for zero
pronoun detection and did not have side effect
on the antecedent identification process. As a
result, the overall accuracy of zero pronoun de-
tection and resolution was improved.
4 Related Work
Kim and Ehara (1995) proposed a probabilis-
tic model to resolve subjective zero pronouns
for the purpose of Japanese/English machine
translation. In their model, the search scope
for possible antecedents was limited to the sen-
tence containing zero pronouns. In contrast,
our method can resolve zero pronouns in both
intra/inter-sentential anaphora types.
Aone and Bennett (1995) used a decision tree
to determine appropriate antecedents for zero
pronouns. They focused on proper and definite
nouns used in anaphoric expressions as well as
zero pronouns. However, their method resolves
only anaphors that refer to organization names
(e.g., private companies), which are generally
easier to resolve than our case.
Both above existing methods require anno-
tated corpora for statistical modeling, while we
used corpora with/without annotations related
to anaphoric relations, and thus we can eas-
ily obtain large-scale corpora to avoid the data
sparseness problem.
Nakaiwa (2000) used Japanese/English bilin-
gual corpora to identify anaphoric relations of
Japanese zero pronouns by comparing J/E sen-
tence pairs. The rationale behind this method
is that obligatory cases zero-pronominalized
in Japanese are usually expressed in English.
However, in the case where corresponding En-
glish expressions are pronouns and anaphors,
their method is not effective. Additionally,
bilingual corpora are more expensive to obtain
than monolingual corpora used in our method.
Finally, our method integrates a parameter
for zero pronoun detection in computing the cer-
tainty score. Thus, we can improve the accuracy
of our system by discarding extraneous outputs
with a small certainty score.
5 Conclusion
We proposed a probabilistic model to ana-
lyze Japanese zero pronouns that refer to an-
tecedents in the previous context. Our model
consists of two probabilistic parameters corre-
sponding to detecting zero pronouns and iden-
tifying their antecedents, respectively. The lat-
ter is decomposed into syntactic and semantic
properties. To estimate those parameters ef-
ficiently, we used annotated/unannotated cor-
pora. In addition, we formalized the certainty
score to improve the accuracy. Through exper-
iments, we showed that the use of unannotated
corpora was effective to avoid the data sparse-
ness problem and that the certainty score fur-
ther improved the accuracy.
Future work would include word sense disam-
biguation for polysemous predicate verbs to se-
lect appropriate case frames in the zero pronoun
detection process.
