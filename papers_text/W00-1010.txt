Abst ract  
We propose a model where dialog 
obligations arise from the interplay 
of social goals and intentions of the 
participants: when an agent is ad- 
dressed with a request, t:he agent's 
decision to commit o the requester's 
linguistic and domain goals is mo- 
tivated by a trade-off between the 
preference for preventing a negative 
reaction of the requester and the 
cost of the actions needed to satisfy 
the goals. 
1 In t roduct ion  
As noticed by (Airenti et al, 1993), a dialog 
.participant, even when he does not commit o 
the domain goals of his partner (i.e., he does- 
n't cooperate behaviorally), typically contin- 
ues to cooperate at the conversational level. 
\[1\] A: Do you have Marlboros? 
B: Uh, no. We ran out 1 
\[2\] A: Can you tell me the time? 
? B :  No. My watch is broken 2
\[3\] A: Could you give me some money 
for the booze? 
B: I won't giv e you a dime 
What leads people to exhibit these forms of 
cooperation? (Traum and Allen, 1994) have 
challenged intention-based approaches to di- 
alog modeling ((Cohen and Levesque, 1990), 
(Lambert and Carberry, 1991), (Airenti et al, 
1993)) arguing that, in non-cooperative s t- 
tings (i.e., when the participants do not have 
1 (Merrit, 1976) 
~(Green and Carberry, 1999) 
shared goals), intention-based approaches 
leave unexplained why a participant should 
bother to be cooperative, both at the con- 
versational and at the behavioral level. In 
order to overcome these difficulties, (Traum 
and Allen, 1994) claim that speech acts 
pose obligations on the hearer: obligations 
are pro-attitudes which provide the hearer 
with a motivation to act, even if he is not 
- strictly speaking - cooperating with the 
speaker. Elaborating this proposal, (Poesio 
and Traum, 1998) propose to add obligations 
to the illocutive effect of speech acts: for in- 
stance, a (successful) question would pose on 
the addressee the obligation to answer; and, 
in general, a speech act poses the obligation 
to ground it. 
While we agree with (Traum and Allen, 1994) 
that cooperation between agents who are not 
part of a group has to be explained by some 
mechanism which obliges an agent to answer 
- at least for refusing explicitly - we want to 
go deeper inside the notion of obligation and 
try to show that it is strictly related to that 
of intention. 
In order to explain obligations, we re- 
sort to the notion of social goals, starting 
from (Goffman, 1981)'s sociolinguistic anal- 
ysis of interactions. We argue that, in non- 
cooperative situations, social goals provide 
agents with the motivation for committing to 
other agents' communicated goals. As shown 
by (Brown and Levinson, 1987), an agent has 
the social goal of taking into account he face 
of other people (and his own as well); this 
concern generates complementary needs for 
the requester and for the requestee. From 
the requester's point of view, it results in 
84 
the production of complex linguistic forms 
aimed at reducing the potential offence in- 
trinsic to a demand to act (conversationally 
or behaviorally); from the requestee's point 
of view, while acceptance normally addresses 
the requester's potential offence by a display- 
ing of good-tempered feelings, any refusal at 
the conversational or behavioral level consti- 
tutes in turn a potential offence to the reques- 
tee's face, and sets up the social need for the 
refusing agent to act in order to nullify this 
potential offence (Goffman, 1981). 
Differently from obligations, ocial goals in- 
fluence actions in an indirect way: in order 
to evaluate the effects of an action on his in- 
terlocutor, an agent has to make a tentative 
prediction of his reaction (anticipatory coordi- 
nation) (Castelfranchi, 1998). This prediction 
allows the agent o keep the partner's possible 
reaction into account when planning his next 
(domain or linguistic) action. Social goals in- 
tervene as preferences during the action se- 
lection phase, by leading the planning agent 
to choose the actions which minimize the of- 
fence to the partner and address the potential 
offence conveyed by a refusal. 
2 The  In teract iona l  F ramework  
2.1 Goals and Preferences 
We assume that every agent A has a set of 
goals G, and a set of preferences P towards 
states of affairs. Besides, an agent has at his 
disposal a set of action operators (recipes for 
achieving domain and linguistic goals, corre- 
sponding to behavioral nd conversational co- 
operation) organized in a hierarchical way. 
The preferences of an agent are expressed 
as functions which map states, represented as 
sets of attribute-value pairs, to real numbers; 
an overall utility function, which consists of 
the weighted sum of the individual functions, 
expresses the utility of reaching the state de- 
picted by a certain configuration ofattributes, 
according to the results of the multi-attribute 
utility theory (Haddawy and Hanks, 1998). 
Goals provide the input to the planning pro- 
cess; in addition, they can appear in the pref- 
erences of the agent, i.e., they can be related 
to a utility function which evaluates the ex- 
pected utility of achieving them 3. On the ba- 
sis of his goals and of the recipes he knows, 
an agent builds a set of plans, by selecting the 
recipes which have among their effects one (or 
more) of the goals in the set. 4 
The planner we use is a modification of the 
DRIPS decision-theoretic h erarchical planner 
(Haddawy and Hanks, 1998). The planning 
process tarts by applying to the current state 
all selected recipes and recursively expands 
the partial plans until the appropriate l vel 
of detail is reached. When the planning algo- 
rithm concludes the refinement of the input 
recipes, it returns the preferred plan, i. e., 
the one with the highest expected utility: the 
agent becomes committed to that plan, which 
constitutes his current intention. The use of 
preferences allows a plan to be ewluated not 
only with respect o the fact that it achieves 
the goal it has been built for, but also with 
respect o its side effects (for instance, con- 
suming less resources). 
2.2 Ant ic ipatory  Coord inat ion and 
Adopt ion 
The planning situation depicted above 
becomes more complex when two or more 
agents interact. In particular, a goal of agent 
A may become known to agent B; a special 
occurrence of this situation arises when A 
has explicitly asked B for help. If this is the 
case, it is possible that agent B comes to 
choose a plan to satisfy this goal, even if it 
does not yield any direct utility to him. 
Notice that if an agent evaluated the utility 
of a plan for achieving a goal that has been 
requested by another agent only on the basis 
of its immediate outcome, he would never 
choose that plan in a non-cooperative s tting: 
performing an action for achieving another 
agent's goal often results only in a negative 
utility, since the side effects of the action 
ZNot all goals are among the preferred states of af- 
fairs, since there are instrurnentalgoals which arise as 
a consequence of the intention to achieve some higher- 
level goal. 
4In the planning process, we distinguish between 
primary effects, which are the goals that led to the 
selection of a given recipe, and side e_ffects, i.e., all 
other effects of the recipe. 
85 
cannot but affect resources and time. The 
reason why B m:topts a partner's goal is the 
fact that the satisfaction of an adopted goal 
can have an indirect utility for B in the light 
of A's reaction. Here, the ability of an agent 
to predict the potential reactions of another 
agent is exploited to decide whether it is 
worth for him to commit to the satisfaction 
of the other agent's goal. 
In order to evaluate how the partner's 
reaction affects his own preferences, like 
not offending the partner and other social 
goals, an agent evaluates the utility of a plan 
by considering the world states resulting 
from the other partner's reaction (one-level 
lookahead), both in case he has commit- 
ted to the partner's goals, and in case he 
has decided that they are not worth pursuing. 
The DRIPS planner has been modified to 
implement the following process of intention 
formation in interactions with other agents 
(see figure 1): 
1. adoption: if A communicates to B a goal 
gA which he wants B to achieve, then the cur- 
rent set of B's goals, GB, becomes G~, the 
union of {gA} and GB. 
2. planning: B builds the set of plans PB 
which aim at achieving (all or some of) the 
goals in G~ (in this way the plans achiev- 
ing also gA are compared with those which 
do not). 
3. anticipatory coordination: from the state 
resulting from each plan pi in PB, B considers 
the possible reaction of A: the world state 
resulting from the reaction becomes the new 
outcome of p~. 
4. preference-driven choice: B chooses the Pi 
in PB whose outcome maximizes his utility. 
For a detailed description of the planning 
algorithm with anticipatory coordination, see 
(Boella, 2000). 
In the following Section, we will show how so- 
cial obligations arise spontaneously in a model 
of conversational interaction which exploits 
the planning framework described above. 
3 Social  Goa ls  and  Conversat iona l  
Cooperat ion  
3.1 Social Goals 
In this section, we exploit the framework de- 
scribed above to model the complex dynamics 
of goals and social preferences that underlies 
examples like \[1\]. In particular, we consider 
the possibility that the partner is offended by 
the agent's response to a request. The offence 
is not modeled as a direct effect of an action 
of the agent. Instead, during the planning 
phase, the agent makes a tentative prediction 
of the partner's attitude in the state where 
he is faced with a refusal, in order to evaluate 
how this state complies with his preference 
for not offending: the partner is offended as a 
result of his reaction to the agent's refusal. 
In our model, the preference for not offend- 
ing the partner corresponds to a social goal ~ 
of an agent: this preference doesn't constitute 
an input to planning, but, by being embodied 
in the utility function of the agent, it con- 
tributes to plan selection, by promoting the 
plans which do not have offending as a conse- 
quence. This is in line with (Goffman, 1967)'s 
claim that "Ordinarily, maintenance of face is 
a condition of interaction, not its objective" 
(p.12). 
Some authors ((Schegloff and Sacks, 1973), 
(Coulthard, 1977)) have characterized the or- 
ganization of conversation i terms of proto- 
typical pairs, adjacency pairs. In our model, 
the existence of adjacency pairs is not mo- 
tivated by the action of specific grounding 
norms, or obligations. 6 Rather, these ex- 
changes are explained by the interplay of the 
communicative intentions of the participants, 
and by their ability to recognize the intentions 
of the interlocutors (Ardissono et al, 2000). 
Sin (Clark, 1996)'s terminology, goals like being 
polite are called interpersonal goals. 
o "Given a speaker's need to know whether his mes- 
sage has been received, and if so, whether or not has 
been passably understood, and given a recipient's need 
to show that he has received the message and correctly 
- given these very fundamental requirements of talk 
as a communication system - we have the essential ra- 
tionale for the existence ofadjacency pairs, that is, 
for the organization f talk into two-part exchanges" 
((Goffman, 1981), p. 12).

Figure 1: The intention formation process in interactions 
In general, the preference for not offending 
which encompasses conversational phenom- 
ena like request-response pairs, is motivated 
by the requestee's goal of displaying a good- 
tempered acceptance of the request itself: in 
(Goffman, 1981)'s terms, communicative ex- 
changes are subject to a set of "constraints 
regarding how each individual ought to han- 
dle himself with respect to each others, so that 
he not discredit his own tacit claim to good- 
character or the tacit claim of the others that 
they are persons of social worth (...)" (p. 16). 
Within an interaction, agents are aware of 
the fact that their actions have social effects, 
like conveying some information about their 
character and about their attitude towards 
the partner: "An act is taken to carry im- 
plications regarding the character of the ac- 
tor and his evaluation of his listeners, as well 
as reflecting on the relationship between him 
and them" ((Goffman, 1981), p. 21). As a 
consequence, agents are very cautious in the 
use of the expressive means they have at dis- 
posal, namely verbal actions: besides moni- 
toring the partner's reactions, they try to an- 
ticipate them with the aim of not offending 
the partner. 
The preference for not offending holds as 
well in the circumstances where an agent is 
forced to refuse his cooperation by the impos- 
sibility of executing the appropriate action to 
achieve the partner's goal. However, if this is 
the case, the requestee has to cope with the 
additional fact that a simple, negative answer 
can be mistakenly taken to count as a refusal 
to cooperate at all: 
\[4\] A: Have you got a cigarette? 
B: No 
For this reason, the refusing agent is likely 
to provide the requester with an acceptable 
reason, i.e. a remedy or account (Levinson, 
1983), when the request is to be turned down. 
What remains to be explained is why ree- 
quests at behavioral level seem to pose less 
constraints on the addressee, if compared 
to requests at conversational level: provided 
that the interactants don't have shared goals, 
it is a matter of fact that it is easier to refuse 
a request for money (see example \[3\]) ~ than 
a request o tell the time (see example \[2\]). 
In particular, conversational goals often force 
the hearer to satisfy them: it is aggressive not 
to answer at all or to ignore the speaker. 
The reason why paying attention to people, 
listening and understanding are not easily re- 
fused is that they are low cost actions, or "free 
goods" in (Goffman, 1967) terminology, so no 
one can refuse them without threatening the 
speaker's face and offending him. A refusal at 
the conversational level - ignoring a potential 
partner and not even responding to his verbal 
request - constitutes a menace to the face of 
the requester, so it is hardly justified. 
7We thank the anonymous reviewers for the ob- 
servation that this example lends itself to a deeper 
analysis, involving further social and psycological pa- 
rameters. However, we will not discuss the example 
here, due to space reasons. 
87 
Up to this point no explicit obligation is 
created: the "obligation to act" depends on 
the utility of the action needed to establish 
cooperation; if the cost of the action is low 
(e.g., a conversational ~=tion): the refusal to 
execute it can be motivated in the requester's 
eyes only by a requestee's negative attitude 
towards him. So, the requester, as a result of 
his ability to infer the requestee's reasoning, 
will be offended by a refusal; the preference 
for not threatening the face of the partners 
and preserving one's own social face normally 
makes the utility of offences negative, thus 
leading requestees toavoiding refusals. At the 
same time, this analysis, by making explicit 
the underlying motivations for the preference 
for a certain type of response, accounts for the 
existence of preferred and dispreferred second 
turns in adjacency pairs. 
3.2 Conversat iona l  Cooperat ion 
The effect on the requester is evaluated by 
the planning agent by means of the antici- 
pation of his reaction. In general, the situa- 
tion a requestee is faced with is constituted 
by the choice between the alternative of sat- 
isfying the requester's conversational or be- 
havioral goals and the alternative of going on 
with his own activity. 
Consider the situation depicted in example 
\[1\] from B's point of view, where B is faced 
with A's indirect request: 
\[1\] A: Do you have Marlboros? 
B: Uh, no. We ran out 
B can attribute to A two main goals (see fig- 
ure 2): s 
1. the behavioral goal that B sells to A a 
packet of cigarettes (sell): however, since A 
cannot ake B's cooperation for granted, this 
goal is related in turn to the goal of know- 
ing whether B has committed to the perlocu- 
tionary intention of selling to A a packet of 
cigarettes (knowif-satisfy), by committing to 
A's goal (satisfy), and, if this is the case, to 
the goal of knowing whether he has completed 
the corresponding plan to sell the cigarettes 
8The recognition ofdomain goals depends on the 
recognition ofthe linguistic goals, :i.e., on the success 
of the linguistic actions. 
(hand the cigarettes, cash, ect.) to A (knowif- 
completed); 
2. the conversational goal of knowing if the 
request has been understood by B and is now 
part of the common ground (grounded); this 
goal directly relates to the management of di- 
alog: if A does not believe that the illocu- 
tionary effect of his question holds, he should 
repeat or reformulate the question. 
Note that, at both levels, subsidiary goals 
arise as part of the intentional behavior of an 
agent: for example, after performing an ac- 
tion for achieving some goal, it is rational to 
check whether this action has succeeded. 9 
B considers if it is possible for him to com- 
mit to the higher-level goal (sell), to which the 
remaining recognized goals are subordinated: 
although B is inclined to satisfy this goal, B 
knows that one of the preconditions for ex- 
ecuting the selling action (has(B, Marlboros)) 
is not true. 
At this point, besides the choice of not re- 
sponding at all, the alternative courses of 
action available to B consist in committing 
to A's goal to know if B has committed to 
his (unachievable) sell goal (knowif-satisfy), 
and the subordinate goal to know if B has 
completed the plan to achieve it (knowif- 
completed), or to commit o A's goal - at con- 
versational level - to have his illocutionary act 
grounded (grounded)3 ? The choice between 
the alternative of not responding at all and 
any of the other alternatives i  accomplished 
by considering the reaction of the partner to a 
refusal at the conversational level; this choice 
is enforced by the consideration that commu- 
nicative actions are "free goods", so they can- 
not be refused without incurring in a state 
where the partner is offended. 
Being committed to the satisfaction of the 
knowif-cornpleted goal, B has to choose be- 
9We will not describe here how these goals are iden- 
tified and kept ogether in a unified structure: works 
like (Ardissono et al, 2000) show how the recognition 
of the intentions stemming from the problem solving 
activity can constitute the required glue 
1?Note that, when producing an illocutionary act to 
satisfy the know-satisfied or knowifieompleted goal, B 
satisfies the grounded goal as well: by displaying the 
reaction to the perlocutionary effect, he uptake of the 
illocutionary effect is granted.

Figure 2: The intentions of A in example \[1\] 
tween different ways to communicate the im- 
possibility to execute the plan. In this case, 
two plans can apply: the simple plan for refus- 
ing, or the elaborated plan for refusing which 
includes a justification for the refusal. 
The first plan is less expensive, by being 
shorter and by not requiring a mental effort; 
however, it is not fully explicit about the mo- 
tivations of the refusal, and so it is potentially 
offensive in the partner's evaluation (A could 
think that B didn't want to sell the cigarettes 
to him). On the contrary, the second plan, 
though more expensive, obeys to the prefer- 
ence for not offending, since it protects the 
refusing requestee from the accusation of non- 
cooperativeness. 
The existence of complex refusal acts has been 
remarked on by (Gree n and Carberry, 1999). 
In their mechanism for initiative in answer 
generation, the ambiguity of a negative an- 
swer to a pre-request between a literal answer 
and a refusal triggers the "Excuse-Indicated" 
rule, which generates the appropriate xpla- 
nation. 
4 Re la ted  Work  
(Traum and Allen, 1994) defined a model of 
linguistic interaction based on the notion of 
obligation. Obligations are pro-attitudes that 
impose less commitment than intentions (so 
that they can be violated), while their social 
character explains why humans are solicited 
to act, in both cooperative and non cooper- 
ative contexts. The notion of obligation has 
been exploited also in applied dialog systems, 
like (Jameson et al, 1996), where they are as- 
sociated to move types. 
While in (Traum and Allen, 1994) discourse 
obligations are social norms that speakers 
have to learn, in our model, the speakers have 
to learn in what conditions humans happen to 
be offended; this same knowledge xplains the 
use of indirect speech acts (as in (Ardissono 
et al, 1999)). 
Moreover, obligations eem somehow redun- 
dant in cooperative contexts, where intentions 
are sufficient o explain grounding and other 
conversational phenomena. 
Differently from (Traum and Allen, 1994), 
(Allwood, 1994) introduces, besides the obli- 
gations associated to the communicative acts, 
two additional sources of obligation which are 
related, respectively, to ethical and rational 
motivations intrinsic to social relations and 
to the management of communication itself. 
Communication management obligations give 
rise to the mechanisms of turn-taking, inter- 
action sequencing, and so on, while the eth- 
ical obligation are socially desirable qualities 
of the interactional behavior: there exists a 
strong social expectation towards them, but 
an agent can decide to disobey them. 
(Kreutel and Matheson, 2000) claim that 
the intentional structure in uncooperative di- 
alogues can be determined by resorting to dis- 
course obligations. In order to do so, they 
define a set of inference rules which allow to 
reconstruct the participants' intentions epa- 
rately from obligations, then show how obli- 
gations account for the existence of conversa- 
tional preferences by addressing pending in- 
tentions. However, the semantic rules they 
89 
propose seem to constitute a shortcut o the 
recognition of the communicative intentions 
of the speaker, which has been proven to 
be necessary to reconstruct dialog coherence 
(Levinson, 1981); the resulting representa- 
tion, since it lacks a model of the private in- 
tentions of the participants inadequately ac- 
counts for the presence of individual inten- 
tions which have to be traded-off against obli- 
gations in situations where cooperation is not 
granted. 
5 An  Example  S i tuat ion  
In order to verify the feasibility of exploit- 
ing social goals for motivating cooperation, 
we have implemented a prototype using a de- 
cision theoretic planner inspired to the ap- 
proach of (Haddawy and Hanks, 1998). The 
planner exploits hierarchical plans to find 
the optimal sequence of actions under uncer- 
tainty, based on a multi-attribute utility func- 
tion. Goals can be by traded off against cost 
(waste of resources) and against each other. 
Five different attributes n have been intro- 
duced to depict the situation in example \[2\], 
where B is interrupted by A while he is ex- 
ecuting a generic action Act; this action is 
aimed at reaching one of B's private goal. 
\[2\] A: Can you tell me the time? 
B: No. My watch is broken 
The following attributes model the states 
involved in the example situation, and appear 
in the effects of the participants' actions. 
? time: it models time as a bounded re- 
source; the utility decreases as a function 
of time; 
? grounded: it models A's goal of knowing 
that B has successfully interpreted the 
request; 
? res: it models the consumption of (generic) 
resources; 
? refused: it is true if A believes that B 
has refused, without any justification, to 
commit o A's communicated goal; 
? offended: it models A's degree of offence; 
n Note that the values 0 and 1 of the attributes 
ground and satisfied.requestrepresent the truth-values 
of the corresponding propositions. 
Other goals like knowing whether B has 
committed to the achievement of the goal or 
whether the achievement has been successful 
or higher-level domain goals are not included 
in this example for space reasons. 
In order to model the alternatives available 
to B, we have introduced the following ac- 
tions (see figure 3). Effects are represented 
as changes in the value of attributes: for ex- 
ample, (time=time+2) means that after the 
execution of the Notify-motivation action, the 
value of the time attribute will increase by 2. 
? Action Tell-time: it represents B's cooper- 
ation with A at the behavioral level (B 
executes the requested action); 
? Action Ground: it has the effect that A 
knows that the illocutionary effect of his 
request has been properly recognized by 
the partner (the grounded attribute is set 
to "true"). 
? Action Notify-impossible: it models B's 
notification that A's goal is impossible 
to achieve; it specializes into two sub- 
actions, Notify-motivation and Notify- 
simple: both actions have a cost in 
terms of resources and time and set the 
grounded attribute to true, but the sec- 
ond one negatively affects the refused at- 
tribute, meaning that A considers it as a 
(possible) unjustified refusal. 
? Action Act: it constitutes B's current plan 
when he is interrupted by A's request. It 
affects both the grounded and the refused 
attribute, by setting the latter to "false". 
? Action Refuse: it represents B's act of 
communicating to A that he will not do 
what A requested, without any justifica- 
tion. Among its effects, there is the fact 
that B comes to know A's choice (refused 
and grounded attribute are set to "true"). 
Before B replies to A's request, the 
grounded attribute is set to false and the re- 
fused attribute is set to true. Note that - with 
the exception of Act - all actions affect the 
value of the grounded attribute, meaning that, 
after performing any of them, A's request re- 
sults grounded anyway, since all these actions 
are coherent replies.

Figure 3: A simplified representation of some of the actions that B can execute: the action 
name is followed by the list of its effects. 
On A's side, we have introduced the action 
React 12 (see Figure 5), that models the change 
of the offended parameter depending on B's 
choice. The key parameter affecting the level 
of offence is the cost 13 of the requested ac- 
tions: the less the cost of the requested ac- 
tion, the greater the offence; this follows the 
principle that low-cost actions cannot be re- 
fused (Goffman, 1967), and, if they are, re- 
questers get offended. The lack of grounding 
is interpreted by A as B is not cooperating 
at the conversational level: since cooperating 
at the conversational level (interpreting the 
sentence, grounding it) has a low cost, it is 
offensive not to do it. 
Now, let's consider in detail the current sit- 
uation, i.e, the one where A has just asked to 
B to do something while B has just performed 
the first step of Act. In order to explore the 
different alternatives, the planner builds and 
evaluates ome plans. These plans differ in 
that the actions for pursuing the partner's 
recognized goal can be included or omitted. 
From the result state of each alternative, the 
planner then tries to predict he reaction of A 
by simulating the execution of the React ac- 
tion by A (see figure 5), and commits to the 
plan whose resulting state after the predicted 
reaction yields the greater utility according to 
B's preferences ( ee Figure 6). 
As explained in Section 2.1., an agent's util- 
ity function is a weighted sum of individual 
utility functions, which represent the prefer- 
*2We assume that weights Wi and Wj are set, re- 
spectively, to 20 and 10. 
*aWhere (cost(action) = (res * 2) + time). 
ences of the agent. The weights associated to 
the individual functions reflect the strength 
of each preference, by allowing for different 
trade-offs among preferences during the pro- 
cess of decision making. 14 
In figure 4, two alternative plans are repre- 
sented, where the utility of B is calculated 
by using the utility function in figure 6. As- 
suming that the weights W1, W2, W3; and 
W4 are set to 10, 5, 8, and 100, respectively, 
B will choose the plan which includes Notify- 
impossible as the first step, and Act - the pros- 
ecution of B's previous activity - as the sec- 
ond step. This solution yields in fact a higher 
utility than the alternative of ignoring A's re- 
quest at all and continuing one's own activity. 
A change in the weights of the utility func- 
tion of B affects his behavior, by determining 
a variation in the degree of cooperation: the 
stronger is the preference for not offending, 
the more cooperative is the agent. For exam- 
ple, if the utility function of B associates a
greater utility to the achievement of B's pri- 
vate goal (by executing Act) than to the social 
preference for not offending, B will decide to 
disregard A's request, both at conversational 
and behavioral level, is On the contrary, if the 
14 As (Traum, 1999) notices with reference to social 
rules, "when they directly conflict with the agent's 
personal goals, the agent may choose to violate them 
(and perhaps suffer the consequences of not meeting 
its obligations)." In our model, this roughly amounts 
to associating a greater utility to the achievement of 
the agent's own goals than to the preference for not 
offending. 
*STipically, this is the case in specific contexts when 
private goals of the addressee are very relevant and 
contrast with the satisfaction of the requester's goal;

In this paper we proposed an intention-based 
approach to dialog that aims at overcoming 
the critics posed by (Traum and Allen, 1994) 
by assuming the existence of social goals. Our 
solution does not rest on an explicit notion 
for  example ,  B cou ld  miss ing  the  t ra in .  
of obligation, even if some similarities can be 
found with (Traum and Allen, 1994). The 
advantage of not resorting to a primitive no- 
tion of obligation is to have a uniform source 
of motivations for explaining the behavior of 
agents. 
With respect to approaches which stipu- 
late a primitive notion of obligation, here, the 
same phenomena are accounted for without 
introducing further propositional attitudes. 
This explanation of the motivations leading 
to cooperation provides an explicative model 
that is uniform with the treatment of deon- 
tic reasoning in agent theories (Conte et al, 
1998), (Boella and Lesmo, 2000) and the def- 
inition of cooperation proposed in (Boella et 
al., 2000). 
It is clear that, by reducing the number 
of propositional attitudes, the reasoning pro- 
cess becomes more complex, but our model 
is aimed at constituting an explanation, and 
it does not exclude the possibility of compil- 
ing the reasoning in more compact form: as 
(Brown and Levinson, 1987) notice, %here is 
a rational basis for conventions, too".
