Abstract 
In experiments on a natural language 
information retrieval system that retrieves 
images based on textual captions, we show 
that syntactic complexity actually aids 
retrieval. We compare two types of 
captioned images, those characterized with 
full sentences in English, and those 
characterized by lists of words and phrases. 
The full-sentence captions show a 15% 
increase in retrieval accuracy over the word- 
list captions. We conclude that the syntactic 
complexity may be of use in fact because it 
decreases semantic ambiguity: the word-list 
captions may be syntactically simple, but 
they are semantically confusingly complex. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper, we describe experiments 
conducted on an image retrieval system, 
PictureQuest, which uses text captions to 
characterize images. The text captions are 
of two types. Optimally, they consist of a 
prose description of the image, generally 
two to three sentences, with perhaps three or 
four additional words or phrases that 
describe emotional or non-literal image 
content, e.g. 
Two little girls play with blocks. The 
younger girl, wearing a blue shirt, laughs 
and prepares to knock over the tower that 
the older girl has constructed The older 
girl, dressed in a red shirt, winces in 
anticipation. 
Siblings, cooperation, rivalry 
Some of the captions in PictureQuest are not 
as well-behaved. They may contain legacy 
data or data shared with a keyword-retrieval 
system. They are optimized for exact-match 
retrieval, and, as such, consist of lists of 
words or, at best, a few short phrases mixed 
in with long lists of words. The same image 
might appear with the following caption: 
girl, girls, little girl little girls, block, 
blocks, play, playing, plays, blue, red, shirt, 
tower, knock; over, construct, construction, 
siblings, cooperation, rivalry 
PictureQuest relies on several natural 
language processing techniques to enhance 
retrieval accuracy. It contains a part-of- 
speech tagger, morphological nalyzer, noun 
phrase pattern matcher, semantic expansion 
based on WordNet, and special processing 
for names and locations. These have been 
tuned to perform most effectively on caption 
text of the first type, i.e. sentences. The 
following chart illustrates how these 
linguistic processes operate - or fail to 
operate - on syntactic units.

2 Complexity Measures 
2.1 Competing Complexity Measures 
How do we determine what syntactic 
complexity is? Does it relate to depth? 
Nesting? Various definitions have been 
used in the various research communities: 
Alzheimer's research, normal and abnormal 
child language acquisition, speech and 
hearing, English teaching, second language 
teaching and acquisition, and theoretical 
linguistics of various persuasions (see, e.g., 
MacDonald 1997; Rosen 1974; Bar-Hillel et 
al. 1967). Fortunately, for the purposes of 
our investigation, we are dealing with broad 
distinctions that would foster agreement 
even among those with different definitions 
of complexity. For the captioned ata, in 
one case, the data are in full sentences. The 
average sentence l ngth is approximately ten 
words, and the average number of sentences 
is between two and three. In the other case, 
the data are either in lists of single words, or 
in lists of single words with a few two-word 
or three-word phrases included, but with no 
sentences whatsoever. Regardless of the 
exact measure of syntactic omplexity used, 
it is clear that sentences are syntactically 
more complex than word lists or even phrase 
lists. 
2.2 Query Complexity 
The standard query length for Web 
applications i between two and three words, 
and our experience with PictureQuest 
confirms that observation. In comparisons 
with other text-based image retrieval 
applications, including keyword systems, 
query complexity is important: one-word 
queries work equally well on keyword 
systems and on linguistically-enhanced 
natural language processing systems. The 
difference comes with longer queries, and in 
particular with syntactic phrases. (Boolean 
three-word queries, e.g. A and B; A or B, do 
not show much difference.) The more 
complex queries (and, in fact, the queries 
that show PictureQuest off to best 
advantage) consist either of a noun phrase or 
are of the form NP V-ing NP. The table 
below summarizes the differences in query 
complexity for natural anguage information 
retrieval as compared to keyword-only 
information retrieval.

2.3 Semantic Complexity 
Semantic complexity is more difficult to 
evaluate, but we can make certain 
observations. Leaving noun phrases intact 
makes a text more semantically complex 
than deconstructing those noun phrases: 
rubber baby buggy bumpers is more 
semantically complex than a simple list of 
nouns and attributes, ince there are various 
modification ambiguities in the longer 
version that are not present once it has been 
reduced to rubber, baby buggy, bumpers (or 
rubber, baby, buggy, bumpers, for that 
matter). 
As for the names of people and locations, 
one could argue that the intact syntactic 
units (AI Gore; George Bush; Arlington, 
Virginia; New England) are semantically 
simpler, since they resolve ambiguity and 
eliminate the spurious readings gore, bush, 
Arlington \[Massachusetts\], new England. 
Nonetheless, we would argue that they are 
syntactically more complex when intact. 
The PictureQuest system uses a WordNet- 
based semantic net to expand the caption 
data. To some extent, the syntactic 
measures (part-of-speech tagging, noun 
phrase pattern matching, name and location 
identification) serve to constrain the 
semantic expansion, since they eliminate 
some possible semantic expansions based on 
syntactic factors. One could interpret he 
word-list captions, then, not as syntactically 
less complex, but rather as semantically ess 
constrained, therefore more ambiguous and 
thus more complex. This view would, 
perhaps, restore the more intuitive notion 
that complexity should lead to worse rather 
than better esults. 
3 Experiments 
While the sentence captions are syntactically 
more complex, by almost any measure, they 
contain more information than the legacy 
word list captions. Specifically, the part-of- 
speech tagger and the noun phrase pattern 
matcher are essentially useless with the 
word lists, since they rely on syntactic 
patterns that are not present. We therefore 
hypothesized that our retrieval accuracy 
would be lower with the legacy word list 
captions than with the sentence captions. 
We performed two sets of experiments, one 
with legacy word list captions and the other 
with sentence captions. Fortunately, the 
corpus can be easily divided, since it is 
possible to select image providers with 
either full sentence or word list captions, and 
limit the search to those providers. In order 
to ensure that we did not introduce a bias 
because of the quality of captioning for a 
particular provider, we aggregated scores 
from at least hree providers in each test. 
Because the collection is large and live, and 
includes ranked results, we selected a 
modified version of precision at 20 rather 
than a manual gold standard precision/recall 
test. We chose this evaluation path for the 
following reasons: 
? Ranking image relevance was difficult 
for humans 
? The collection was large and live, i.e. 
changing daily 
? The modified measure more accurately 
reflected user evaluations 
-" 3 
We performed experiments initially with 
manual ranking, and found that it was 
impossible to get reliable cross-coder 
judgements for ranked results. That is, we 
could get humans to assess whether an 
image should or should not have been 
included, but the rankings did not yield 
agreement. Complicating the problem was 
the fact that we had a large collection 
(400,000+ images), and creating a test 
subset meant that most queries would 
generate almost no relevant results. Finally, 
we wanted to focus more on precision than 
on  recall, because our work with users had 
made it clear that precision was far more 
important in this application. 
To evaluate precision at 20 for this 
collection, we used the crossing measure 
introduced in Flank 1998. The crossing 
measure (in which any image ranked above 
another, better-matching image counts as an 
error) is both finer-grained and better suited 
to a ranking application in which user 
evaluations are not binary. We calibrated 
the crossing measure (on a subset of the 
queries) as follows: 
Precision at 20 Images for 
All Terms 
53 
Precision at 5 Images for All 59 
Terms 
Precision at 20 Images for 100 
Any Term 
Crossing Measure at 20 91 
i Images I 
That is, we calculated the precision "for all 
terms" as a binary measure with respect to a 
query, and scored an error if any terms in the 
query were not matched. For the "any term" 
precision measure, we scored an error only 
if the image failed to match any term in the 
query in such a way that a user would 
consider it a partial match. 
Thus, for example, for an "all terms" match, 
tall glass of beer succeeded only when the 
images howed (and captions mentioned) all 
three terms tall, glass, and beer, or their 
synonyms. For an "any-term" match, tall or 
glass or beer or a direct synonym would 
need to be present (but not, say, glasses). 
(For two of the test queries, fewer than 20 
images were retrieved, so the measure is, 
more precisely, R-precision: precision at the 
number of documents retrieved or at 20 or 5, 
whichever is less. 
4 Results 
We found a statistically significant 
difference in retrieval quality between the 
syntactically simple word list captions and 
the syntactically complex sentence captions. 
The word list captions cored 74.6% on our 
crossing measure, while the sentence 
captions cored 89.5%. 
We performed one test comparing one-word 
and two-word queries on sentence versus 
word list captions. The sentence captions 
showed little difference: 82.7% on the one- 
word queries, and 80% on the two-word 
queries. The word-list captions, however, 
were dramatically worse on two-word 
queries (70.5%) than on one-word queries 
(89.7%). 
Overall 74.6% 89.5% 
1-word 89.7% 82.7% 
2-word 7015% 80% 
5 Conclusion 
Our experiments indicate that, in an 
information retrieval system tuned to 
recognize and reward matches using 
syntactic information, syntactic omplexity 
yields better results than syntactically 
4 
mixed-up "word salad." One can interpret 
these results from a semantic complexity 
standpoint, since the syntactically simple 
captions all include considerably more 
semantic ambiguity, unconstrained as they 
are from a syntactic standpoint. This 
observation leads us to an additional 
conclusion about the relationship between 
syntactic and semantic complexity: in this 
instance, at least, the relationship is inverse 
rather than direct. The word-list captions 
are syntactically simple but, as a result, 
since syntactic factors are not available to 
limit ambiguity, semantically more complex 
than the same information presented in a 
more syntactically complex fashion, i.e. in 
sentences.
