We present a new approach to dialogue
processing in terms of ?meaning units?. In
our annotation task, we asked speakers of
English and Chinese to mark boundaries
where they could construct the maximal
concept using minimal words. We com-
pared English data across genres (news,
literature, and policy). We analyzed the
agreement for annotators using a state-of-
the-art segmentation similarity algorithm
and compared annotations with a random
baseline. We found that annotators are
able to identify meaning units systemati-
cally, even though they may disagree on
the quantity and position of units. Our
analysis includes an examination of phrase
structure for annotated units using con-
stituency parses.1 Introduction
When humans translate and interpret speech in
real-time, they naturally segment speech in ?min-
imal sense units? (Ole?ron & Nanpon, 1965;
Ben??tez & Bajo, 1998) in order to convey the
same information from one language to another as
though there were a 1-to-1 mapping of concepts
between both languages. Further, it is known that
people can hold up to 7+/- 2 ?chunks? of informa-
tion in memory at a time by creating and applying
meaningful organization schemes to input (Miller,
1956). However, there is no definitive linguistic
description for the kind of ?meaning units? that
human translators create (Signorelli et al, 2011;
Hamon et al, 2009; Mima et al, 1998).
The ability to chunk text according to units of
meaning is key to developing more sophisticated

real-time, as well as informing discourse process-
ing and natural language understanding (NLU)
(Kola?r?, 2008). We present an approach to dis-
course phenomena to address Keller?s (2010) call
to find a way to incorporate ?cognitive plausibil-
ity? into natural language processing (NLP) sys-
tems. As it has been observed that human trans-
lators and interpreters naturally identify a certain
kind of ?meaning unit? when translating speech
in real-time (Ole?ron & Nanpon, 1965; Ben??tez &
Bajo, 1998), we want to uncover the features of
those units in order to automatically identify them
in discourse.
This paper presents an experimental approach
to annotating meaning units using human anno-
tators from Mechanical Turk. Our goal was to
use the results of human judgments to inform
us if there are salient features of meaning units
in English and Chinese text. We predicted that
human-annotated meaning units should systemat-
ically correspond to some other linguistic features
or combinations of those features (i.e. syntax,
phrase boundaries, segments between stop words,
etc.). We are interested in the following research
questions:
? At what level of granularity do English and
Chinese speakers construct meaning units in
text?
? Do English and Chinese speakers organize
meaning units systematically such that mean-
ing unit segmentations are not random?
? How well do English and Chinese speakers
agree on meaning unit boundaries?
? Are there salient syntactic features of mean-
ing units in English and Chinese?
? Can we automatically identify a 1-to-1 map-
ping of concepts for parallel text, even if there
is paraphrasing in one or both languages?
1
While we have not built a chunker or classifier
for meaning unit detection, it is our aim that this
work will inform how to parse language system-
atically in a way that is human-understandable. It
remains to be seen that automatic tools can be de-
veloped to detect meaning units in discourse. Still,
we must be informed as to what kinds of chunks
are appropriate for humans to allow them to under-
stand information transmitted during translation
(Kola?r?, 2008). Knowledge about meaning units
could be important for real-time speech process-
ing, where it is not always obvious where an ut-
terance begins and ends, due to any combination
of natural pauses, disfluencies and fillers such as
?like, um..?. We believe this work is a step towards
creating ultra-fast human-understandable simulta-
neous translation systems that can be used for con-
versations in different languages.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2
discusses related work, Section 3 describes the
segmentation similarity metric that we used for
measuring annotator agreement, Section 4 de-
scribes our experiment design, Section 5 shows
experiment results, Section 6 provides analysis,
and Section 7 discusses future work.2 Related Work
At the current state of the art, automatic simultane-
ous interpretation systems for speech function too
slowly to allow people to conduct normal-paced
conversations in different languages. This prob-
lem is compounded by the difficulty of identifying
meaningful endpoints of utterances before trans-
mitting a translation. For example, there is a per-
ceived lag time for speakers when trying to book
flights or order products over the phone. This lag
time diminishes conversation quality since it takes
too long for each speaker to receive a translation
at either end of the system (Paulik et al, 2009). If
we can develop a method to automatically identify
segments of meaning as they are spoken, then we
could significantly reduce the perceived lag time
in real-time speech-to-speech translation systems
and improve conversation quality (Baobao et al,
2002; Hamon et al, 2009).
The problem of absence of correspondence
arises when there is a lexical unit (single words
or groups of words) that occurs in L1 but not
in L2 (Lambert et al, 2005). It happens when
words belonging to a concept do not correspond to
phrases that can be aligned in both languages. This
problem is most seen when translating speech-to-
speech in real-time. One way to solve this prob-
lem is to identify units for translation that cor-
respond to concepts. A kind of meaning unit
had been previously proposed as information units
(IU), which would need to be richer than seman-
tic roles and also be able to adjust when a mis-
take or assumption is realized (Mima et al, 1998).
These units could be used to reduce the explosion
of unresolved structural ambiguity which happens
when ambiguity is inherited by a higher level syn-
tactic structure, similar to the use of constituent
boundaries for transfer-driven machine translation
(TDMT) (Furuse et al, 1996).
The human ability to construct concepts in-
volves both bottom-up and top-down strategies in
the brain. These two kinds of processes inter-
act and form the basis of comprehension (Kintsch,
2005). The construction-integration model (CI-2)
describes how meaning is constructed from both
long-term memory and short-term memory. One
of the challenges of modeling meaning is that it
requires a kind of world-knowledge or situationalknowledge, in addition to knowing the meanings
of individual words and knowing how words can
be combined. Meaning is therefore constructed
from long-term memory ? as can be modeled by
latent semantic analysis (LSA) ? but also from
short-term memory which people use in the mo-ment (Kintsch & Mangalath, 2011). In our work,
we are asking annotators to construct meaning
from well-formed text and annotate where units of
meaning begin and end.3 Similarity Agreement
We implemented segmentation similarity (S) from
Fournier and Inkpen (2012). Segmentation sim-
ilarity was formulated to address some gaps of
the WindowDiff (WD) metric, including unequal
penalty for errors as well as the need to add
padding to the ends of each segmentation (Pevzner
& Hearst, 2002). There are 3 types of segmenta-
tion errors for (S), listed below:
1. s1 contains a boundary that is off by n poten-
tial boundaries in s2
2. s1 contains a boundary that s2 does not, or
3. s2 contains a boundary that s1 does not
These three types of errors are understood astranspositions in the case of error type 1, and as
2
substitutions in the case of error types 2 and 3.
Note that there is no distinction between insertions
and deletions because neither of the segmentations
are considered reference or hypothesis. We show
the specification of (S) in (1):
S(si1,si2) =
t ? mass(i)  t  d(si1,si2,T )
t ? mass(i)  t
(1)
such that S scales the cardinality of the set of
boundary types t because the edit distance func-
tion d(si1,si2,T ) will return a value for potential
boundaries of [0, t ? mass(i)] normalized by the
number of potential boundaries per boundary type.
The value of mass(i) depends on task, in our
work we treat mass units as number of words, for
English, and number of characters for Chinese.
Since our annotators were marking only units of
meaning, there was only one boundary type, and
(t = 1). The distance function d(si1,si2,T ) is the
edit distance between segments calculated as the
number of boundaries involved in transposition
operations subtracted from the number of substi-
tution operations that could occur. A score of 1.0
indicates full agreement whereas a score of 0 indi-
cates no agreement.
In their analysis and comparison of this new
metric, Fournier and Inkpen (2012) demonstrated
the advantages of using (S) over using (WD)
for different kinds of segmentation cases such
as maximal/minimal segmentation, full misses,
near misses, and segmentation mass scale effects.
They found that in each of these cases (S) was
more stable than (WD) over a range of segment
sizes. That is, when considering different kinds
of misses (false-positive, false-negative, and both),
the metric (S) is less variable to internal segment
size. These are all indications that (S) is a more
reliable metric than (WD).
Further, (S) properly takes into account chance
agreement - called coder bias - which arises in
segmentation tasks when human annotators either
decide not to place a boundary at all, or are un-
sure if a boundary should be placed. Fournier and
Inkpen (2012) showed that metrics that follow (S)
specification reflect most accurately on coder bias,
when compared to mean pairwise 1   WD met-
rics. Therefore we have decided to use segmenta-
tion similarity as a metric for annotator agreement.
4 Experiment Design
This section describes how we administered our
experiment as an annotation task. We surveyed
participants using Mechanical Turk and presented
participants with either English or Chinese text.
While the ultimate goal of this research direc-
tion is to obtain meaning unit annotations for
speech, or transcribed speech, we have used well-
structured text in our experiment in order to find
out more about the potential features of meaning
units in the simplest case.4.1 Sample Text PreparationGenre: Our text data was selected from three dif-
ferent genres for English (news, literature, and
policy) and one genre for Chinese (policy). We
used 10 articles from the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) in parallel for English and
Chinese. The English news data (NEWS) con-
sisted of 10 paragraphs that were selected online
from www.cnn.com and reflected current events
from within the United States. The English liter-
ature data (LIT) consisted of 10 paragraphs from
the novel Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. The En-
glish and Chinese UDHR data consisted of 12 par-
allel paragraphs from the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. The number of words and number
of sentences by language and genre is presented
below in Table 1.Preprocessing: To prepare the text samples for
annotation, we did some preprocessing. We re-
moved periods and commas in both languages,
since these markings can give structure and mean-
ing to the text which could influence annotator de-
cisions about meaning unit boundaries. For the
English data, we did not fold to lowercase and we
acknowledge that this was a design oversight. The
Chinese text was automatically segmented into
words before the task using ICTCLAS (Zhang et
al., 2003). This was done in order to encourage
Chinese speakers to look beyond the character-
level and word-level, since word segmentation is
a well-known NLP task for the Chinese language.
The Chinese UDHR data consisted of 856 charac-
ters. We placed checkboxes between each word in
the text.4.2 Mechanical Turk Annotation
We employed annotators using Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). All
instructions for the task were presented in En-

glish. Each participant was presented with a set of
numbered paragraphs with a check-box between
each word where a boundary could possibly ex-
ist. In the instructions, participants were asked
to check the boxes between words correspond-
ing to the boundaries of meaning units. They
were instructed to create units of meaning larger
than words but that are also the ?maximal concept
that you can construct that has the minimal set of
words that can be related to each individual con-
cept?1. We did not provide marked examples to
the annotators so as to avoid influencing their an-
notation decisions.
Participants were given a maximum of 40 min-
utes to complete the survey and were paid USD
$1.00 for their participation. As per Amazon
Mechanical Turk policy, each of the participants
were at least 18 years of age. The annotation
task was restricted to one task per participant, in
other words if a participant completed the English
NEWS annotation task then they could not partic-
ipate in the Chinese UDHR task, etc. We did not
test any of the annotators for language aptitude
or ability, and we did not survey language back-
ground. It is possible that for some annotators,
English and Chinese were not a native language.5 Results
We omitted survey responses for which partici-
pants marked less than 30 boundaries total, as well
as participants who completed the task in less than
5 minutes. We did this in an effort to eliminate
annotator responses that might have involved ran-
dom marking of the checkboxes, as well as those
who marked only one or two checkboxes. We de-
cided it would be implausible that less than 30
boundaries could be constructed, or that the task
1The definition of ?meaning units? we provide is very am-
biguous and can justify for different people understanding the
task differently. However, this is part of what we wanted to
measure, as giving a more precise and operational definition
would bias people to some specific segmentation criteria.
could be completed in less than 5 minutes, con-
sidering that there were several paragraphs and
sentences for each dataset. After we removed
those responses, we had solicited 47 participants
for English NEWS, 40 participants for English
LIT, 59 participants for English UDHR, and 10
participants for Chinese UDHR. The authors ac-
knowledge that the limited sample size for Chi-
nese UDHR data does not allow a direct compar-
ison across the two languages, however we have
included it in results and analysis as supplemental
findings and encourage future work on this task
across multiple languages. We are unsure as to
why there was a low number of Chinese annota-
tors in this task, except perhaps the task was not as
accessible to native Chinese speakers because the
task instructions were presented in English.5.1 Distributions by Genre
We show distributions of number of annotators
and number of units identified for each language
and genre in Figures 1 ? 4. For each of the
language/genres, we removed one annotator be-
cause the number of units that they found was
greater than 250, which we considered to be
an outlier in our data. We used the Shapiro-
Wilk Test for normality to determine which, if
any, of these distributions were normally dis-
tributed. We failed to reject the null hypothesis for
Chinese UDHR (p = 0.373) and English NEWS
(p = 0.118), and we rejected the null hypothe-
sis for English LIT (p = 1.8X10 04) and English
UDHR (p = 1.39X10 05).Dataset N Avg AvgUnits Words/Unit

we used 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
Tests to identify separate distributions for each of
these genres. We found 3 distinct groups in En-
glish UDHR (G1?G3) and 2 distinct groups in En-
glish LIT (G1 and G2). Table 2 provides more

detailed information about distributions for num-
ber of annotations, as well as the average number
of units found, and average words per unit. This
information informs us as to how large or small
on average the meaning units are. Note that in Ta-
ble 2 we include information for overall English
UDHR and overall English LIT distributions for
reference. The authors found it interesting that,
from Table 2, the number of words per meaning
unit generally followed the 7 +/- 2 ?chunks? phe-
nomenon, where chunks are words.5.2 Annotator Agreement
Even though some of the annotators agreed about
the number of units, that does not imply that
they agreed on where the boundaries were placed.
We used segmentation similarity (S) as a metric
for annotator agreement. The algorithm requires
specifying a unit of measurement between bound-
aries ? in our case we used word-level units for
English data and character-level units for Chinese
data. We calculated average similarity agreement
for segment boundaries pair-wise within-group
for annotators from each of the 9 language/genre
datasets, as presented in Table 3.
While the segmentation similarity agreements
seem to indicate high annotator agreement, we
wanted to find out if that agreement was bet-
ter than what we could generate at random, so
we compared annotator agreement with random
baselines. To generate the baselines, we used
the average number of segments per paragraph in
each language/genre dataset and inserted bound-
aries at random. For each of the 9 language/genre
datasets, we generated 30 baseline samples. We
calculated the baseline segmentation similarity

Constructing concepts in this task is systematic
as was shown from the segmentation similarity
scores. Since we know that the annotators agreed
on some things, it is important to find out what
they have agreed on. In our analysis, we exam-
ined unit boundary locations across genres in addi-
tion to phrase structure using constituency parses.
In this section, we begin to address another of
our original research questions regarding how well
speakers agree on meaning unit boundary posi-
tions across genres and which syntactic features
are the most salient for meaning units.
6.1 Unit Boundary Positions for Genres
Boundary positions are interesting because they
can potentially indicate if there are salient parts
of the texts which stand out to annotators across
genres. We have focused this analysis across gen-
res for the overall data for each of the 4 lan-
guage/genre pairs. Therefore, we have omitted the
subgroups ? English UDHR groups (G1,G2, G3)
and English LIT groups (G1, G2). Although seg-
mentation similarity is greater within-group from
Table 3, this was not enough to inform us of which
boundaries annotators fully agree on. For each of
the datasets, we counted the number of annotators
who agreed on a given boundary location and plot-
ted histograms. In these plots we show the number
of annotators of each potential boundary between
words. We show the resulting distributions in Fig-
ures 5 ? 8.

that at most 4 annotators agreed on boundary po-
sitions. We can see from Figures 6 ? 8 that there
is high frequency of agreement in the text which
corresponds to paragraph boundaries for the En-
glish data, however paragraph boundaries were ar-
tificially introduced into the experiment because
each paragraph was numbered.
Since we had removed all punctuation mark-
ings, including periods and commas for both lan-
guages, it is interesting to note there was not full
agreement about sentence boundaries. While we
did not ask annotators to mark sentence bound-
aries, we hoped that these would be picked up by
the annotators when they were constructing mean-
ing units in the text. Only 3 sentence boundaries
were identified by at most 2 Chinese UDHR an-
notators. On the other hand, all of the sentence
boundaries were idenfied for English UDHR and
English NEWS, and one sentence boundary was
unmarked for English LIT. However, there were
no sentence boundaries in the English data that
were marked by all annotators - in fact the sin-
gle most heavily annotated sentence boundary was
for English NEWS, where 30% of the annota-
tors marked it. The lack for identifying sentence
boundaries could be due to an oversight by anno-
tators, or it could also be indicative of the difficulty
and ambiguity of the task.6.2 Phrase Structure
To answer our question of whether or not there are
salient syntactic features for meaning units, we did
some analysis with constituency phrase structure
and looked at the maximal projections of meaning
units. For each of the 3 English genres (UDHR,
NEWS, and LIT) we identified boundaries where
at least 50% of the annotators agreed. For the Chi-
nese UDHR data, we identified boundaries where
at least 30% of annotators agreed. We used the
Stanford PCFG Parser on the original English and
Chinese text to obtain constituency parses (Klein
& Manning, 2003), then aligned the agreeable
segment boundaries with the constituency parses.
We found the maximal projection corresponding
to each annotated unit and we calculated the fre-
quency of each of the maximal projections. The
frequencies of part-of-speech for maximal projec-
tions are shown in Tables 5 - 8. Note that the part-
of-speech tags reflected here come from the Stan-
ford PCFG Parser.Max. Projection Description Freq.S, SBAR, SINV Clause 28PP Prepositional Phrase 14VP Verb Phrase 11NP Noun Phrase 5ADJP Adjective Phrase 3ADVP Adverb Phrase 1

Clauses were by far the most salient bound-
aries for annotators of English. On the other hand,
nouns, noun phrases, and verb phrases were the
most frequent for annotators of Chinese. There
is some variation across genres for English. This
analysis begins to address whether or not it is
possible to identify syntactic features of meaning
units, however it leaves open another question as
to if it is possible to automatically identify a 1-to-1
mapping of concepts across languages.7 Discussion and Future Work
We have presented an experimental framework
for examining how English and Chinese speakers
make meaning out of text by asking them to la-
bel places that they could construct concepts with
as few words as possible. Our results show that
there is not a unique ?meaning unit? segmentation
criteria among annotators. However, there seems
to be some preferential trends on how to perform
this task, which suggest that any random segmen-
tation is not acceptable. As we have simplified the
task of meaning unit identification by using well-
structured text from the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, news, and literature, future work
should examine identifying meaning units in tran-
scribed speech.
Annotators for the English UDHR and English
LIT datasets could be characterized by their dif-
ferent granularities of annotation in terms of num-
ber of units identified. These observations are in-
sightful to our first question: what granularity do
people use to construct meaning units? For some,
meaning units consist of just a few words, whereas
for others they consist of longer phrases or possi-
bly clauses. As we did not have enough responses
for the Chinese UDHR data, we are unable to com-
ment if identification of meaning units in Chinese
fit a similar distribution as with English and we
leave in-depth cross-language analysis to future
work.
A particularly interesting finding was that hu-
man annotators share agreement even across
groups, as seen from Table 4. This means that al-
though annotators may not agree on the number of
meaning units found, they do share some agree-
ment regarding where in the text they are creating
the meaning units. These findings seem to indicate
that annotators are creating meaning units system-
atically regardless of granularity.
Our findings suggest that different people orga-
nize and process information differently. This is a
very important conclusion for discourse analysis,
machine translation and many other applications
as this suggests that there is no optimal solution
to the segmentation problems considered in these
tasks. Future research should focus on better un-
derstanding the trends we identified and the ob-
served differences among different genres. While
we did not solicit feedback from annotators in this
experiment, we believe that it will be important
to do so in future work to improve the annota-
tion task. We know that the perceived lag time in
speech-to-speech translation cannot be completely
eliminated but we are interested in systems that are
?fast? enough for humans to have quality conver-
sations in different languages.Acknowledgments
