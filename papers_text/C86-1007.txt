The work reported here is being conducted as 
part  of the LOKI  p ro jec t  (ESPRIT Pro ject  
I07, "A leg io  or iented approach to knowledge 
and data bases support ing natura l  user 
in teract ion" ) .  The goal of the NL part  of 
the pro jec t  is  to bui ld  a pragmat ica l ly  
sens i t i ve  natura l  language in ter face  to a 
knowledge base. By "pragmat ica l ly  
sens i t i ve" ,  we mean that  the system should 
not only produce wel l - formed coherent and 
cohesive language (a minimum requirement of 
any NL system designed to handle d iscourse) ,  
but should also be sens i t i ve  to those 
aspects o~ user behaviour that  humans are 
sens i t i ve  %o over and above simply providing 
a good response, inc lud ing producing output 
that  is  appropr ia te ly  decorated with those 
minor and semant ica l ly  inconsequentia l  
elements of language that  make the 
d i f fe rence  between natura l  language and 
natura l  natura l  language. 
This paper concentrates on the 
representat ion  of the s t ruc ture  of 
conversat ion in our system. We w i l l  f i r s t  
out l ine  ~he representat ion  we use fo r  
dialogue moves, and then out l ine  the nature 
of the de f in i t ion  of wel l - formed dialogue 
that  we are operat ing wi th .  F ina l ly ,  we w i l l  
note a few extensions to the representat ion  
mechanism. 
2. The HOVE f rame 
We are  assuming a seven-s lo t  f rame fo r  the 
representat ion  of moves w i th in  a dia logue,  
with the fo l low ing  s lo ts :  HOVE, USER, AGENT, 
TURN, ACT~ BASE, CONT. Every move in a 
conversat ion is  represented by such a frame. 
The HOVE s lo t  uniquely iden i t i f i es  a 
par t i cu la r  move in the conversat ion by an 
arb i t ra ry  in teger .  The USER s lo t  ident i f ies  
the oucrent user of the system. The AGENT 
s lo t  spec i f ies  whether i t  i~ a user move o~' 
a system move. The TURN s lo t  has the value 
OPEN n or CLOSE n, where n is  a number that  
re fe rs  to a par t i cu la r  exchange. Typ ica l ly ,  
a move with a value OPEN n fo r  the TURN s lo t  
might be a request,  and one with a CLOSE n 
value the c~orresponding response. 
The ACT s lo t  spec i f ies  what act is  performed 
by the ut terance.  This w i l l  be e i ther  a 
speech act ,  or the value ACTION, since not 
a l l  moves need be speech acts .  The range of 
speech acts that  the system wi l l  have to 
reoognise or' produce is  c lear ly  smal ler  than 
that  which occurs in conversat ions between 
humans. Furthermore, cer ta in  speech acts 
w i l l  be of primary importance given the 
domain of app l i ca t ion  of the system, namely, 
as a f ront  end to an expert  system. We have 
there fore  produced an in i t ia l  h ierarchy of 
potent ia l l y  re levant  speech acts 
(Waehtel 1985a), where the major 
c lass i f i ca t ion  is  in to  requests,  asser t ions  
and commentaries. Some of these are re fer red  
to below. Many of the speech acts we use go 
one level  below what is  t rad i t iona l ly  viewed 
as a speech act ( i .e .  in the sense of Austin 
(~952), Searle (1969), e tc . )  and may be 
compared with d i s t inc t ions  that  McKeown 
(1985: 9 f f . ) ,  fo r  example, discusses under 
the category of " rhetor i ca l  p red icates" ,  
though they are by no means the same. The 
only speech acts discussed below a~e 
re fer red  to by the fo l low ing  abbrev ia t ions :  
REQACT request - fo r -ac t ion  
REQAFF request - fo r -a f f ipmat ion  
SUPPAFF supp ly -o f -a f f i rmat ion  
REQCONST request - fo r -constant  
SUPPCONST supp ly -o f -constant  
REQCONF request - fo r -conf i rmat ion  
SUPPCONF supp ly -o f -conf i rmat ion  
The BASE s lo t  spec i f ies  the current  top ic ,  
in the very res t r i c ted  sense cf a po inter  to 
the node in the ~emantic network that  
corresponds to the ob ject  what the current  
exchange is about. This s imp l i s t i c  view of 
top ic  is adopted here as a f i r s t  step only,  
and serves to i~ lus t ra te  the points 
discussed below. 
The CONT s lo t  spec i f ies  the semantic 
representat ion  of the ut terance,  and we 
envisage using the same representat ion  fo r  
semantics and fo r  ac t ions ,  so that  a l l  
possible ACT types can be represented 
un i formly  in the CONT s lo t .  In par t i cu la r ,  
we w i l l  def ine an exchange as a pai r  of 
utterances with the same value fo r  the CONT 
s lo t ,  fo r  the time being. This is of course 
too s t r i c t .  Other funct ions  spec i fy ing 
35 
" loca l  coherence" in the sense of Hobbs 
(1982: 227) are also re levant  here. The 
par t i cu la r  i l l oout ionary  force of an 
utterance w i l l  be a funct ion  of the value of 
the ACT s lo t  and the CONT s lo t .  Subdialogues 
that  are not in the mainstream of the 
conversat ion w i l l  be ident i f ied  by 
par t i cu la r  re la t ionsh ip  of values fo r  the 
TURN s lo t  between adjacent moves, enhanced 
by the values of the ACT s lo ts  fo r  the 
moves .  
Some examples of the use of th i s  frame to 
represent  sequences  of u t te rances  in 
conversat ions  can be found in Waohte l  
(1985b, 1985o), inc luding i t s  use to 
ident i fy  sh i f t s  of top ic ,  subdialogues and 
relevance, as well  as the contextual  
d isambiguat ion  of speech acts, which is the 
main top ic  of these work ing  papers.  
3. The s t ruc ture  of conversat ion 
We assume that  i t  is  possible to def ine the 
s t ruc ture  of a possible conversat ion by 
ru le .  Actual human-human conversat ions may 
defy such ana lys is ,  as i l l us t ra ted  by, fo r  
example,  the work of Sachs,  Scheg lo f f  & 
Je f fe rson  (1974). However, the poss ib le  
ways in which the conversat ions we are 
dealing with may go are severely l im i ted  by 
three fac tors :  (a) th i s  is  an in ter face  to 
an expert  system (or some s imi la r ly  spec i f i c  
so f tware) ,  which de l imi ts  the possible range 
of top ics ;  (b) one of the par t i c ipants  in 
the dialogue is a machine, which means that  
i t  w i l l  not suddenly want to ind icate  that ,  
for example,  A lber t ' s  n iece is a f r iend f rom 
school ,  but this fact has no bear ing on the 
suppor t ive  th ings  being said about  her; and 
(o) the other par t i c ipant  knows that  his 
in ter locutor  is a machine, and w i l l  behave 
accord ing ly .  Therefore ,  what we need to 
model is not a typ ica l ly  natura l  open human 
conversat ion,  but a res t r i c ted  type of 
conversat ion that  also occurs between humans 
in cer ta in  wel l -c i rcumscr ibed contexts .  For 
example, a conversat ion between a would-be 
passenger and a t i cket  c le rk  at a ra i lway  
s ta t ion  is  c loser  to what we need to model, 
and in  such oases i t  is  possible to def ine 
what is or is not a we l l - fo rmed conversat ion  
by ru les  of an abst rac t  nature that  may wel l  
be inadequate fo r  other natura l ly  occurr ing 
converat ions.  
We there fore  propose three ru les  that  def ine 
the not ion of wel l - formed conversat ion in 
the present context ,  making the fo l low ing  
assumptions. The s t ruc ture  of a conversat ion 
can be represented as a t ree  s t ruc ture .  The 
wellformedness of such t rees  can be defined 
by rewr i te  ru les .  The maximal number of 
leve ls  of embedding in such t rees  is  s ix  
(see below). In par t i cu la r ,  subdialogues can 
be embedded w i th in  dialogues,  but there can 
be no embedding w i th in  subdialogues. The 
las t  res t r i c t ion  conf l i c ts  with what people 
do. It i s  one of the res t r i c t ions  we 
consider necessary, and which can be handled 
in such a way that  the user w i l l  not not ice  
36 
that  any such res t r i c t ion  ex is ts .  
We assume that  the fo l low ing  four categor ies  
are su f f i c ient  fo r  the representat ion  of the 
s t ruc ture  of conversat ion.  The symbols used 
serve as mnemonics fo r  the i r  approximate 
counterparts  in Engl ish,  but they should not 
be s t r i c t ly  equated with them: CONV 
(conversat ion) ,  DIAL (d ia logue) ,  EXCH 
(exchange) and MOVE (as discussed above). 
To formulate in informal terms the general 
s ty le  and atmosphere of the ru les  that  we 
w i l l  propose more fo rmal ly  below, le t  us say 
that  a CONV may cons is t  of one or more 
DIALs, a DIAL may cons is t  of one or more 
EXCHs, and an EXCH cons is ts  of two MOVEs, 
with each of these MOVEs fo l lowed by an 
opt iona l  DIAL. 
A major po int  about conversat ions that  must 
be handled in a grammar of th i s  type is the 
fac t  that  although MOVEs are the only 
terminal  nodes, and are there fore  the nodes 
that  correspond to the utterances that  are 
ac tua l ly  produced, with a l l  other  nodes 
represent ing more abst rac t  elements, cer ta in  
features  of conversat ion need to be 
associated with these abst rac t  nodes. For 
example, although each MOVE is spec i f ied  fo r  
who the current  user of the system is and 
each MOVE also has a par t i cu la r  top ic ,  as 
discussed above, these not ions proper ly  
belong to more abst rac t  leve ls  of 
conversat ional  s t ruc ture .  Who the user  i s  
can be defined at the CONV level  ( i .e .  we 
def ine a CONV as a conversat ion with one 
user) .  The top ic  of an utterance can be 
defined at  the DIAL level  ( i .e .  a CONV can 
cons is t  of one or more dialogues,  each on a 
s ing le  top ic ) .  Furthermore, a DIAL can 
cons is t  of one or more EXCHs, and i t  is  at 
th i s  po int  that  the content of the 
utterances that  form part  of that  EXCH is 
def ined.  
Let us now be more prec ise.  We assume that  
some of the s lo ts  mentioned above in the 
MOVE frame are represented as features  on 
the nodes in the t rees represent ing the 
s t ruc ture  of the conversat ion of which the 
moves described by the MOVE frames are par t .  
This assoc ia t ion  of features  with nodes, 
plus the assumption that  a l l  features  
t r i ck le  down, with a few exceptions 
discussed below, provides fo r  t rees  of the 
general form shown in Table i .  The lower 
case le t te rs  are constants.  Note that  the 
values of the BASE feature  on the 
subdialogue nodes have not been spec i f ied .  
We re turn  to th i s  po int  below. Table I 
represents a goal :  the sor t  of s t ruc tures  we 
want the ru les  to produce. The fo l low ing  
three ru les  generate t rees  of th i s  type.  
Kleene Plus notat ion  is used. 
The notat ion  should be in terpreted  as 
fo l lows .  Roman le t te rs  as feature  values are 
constants.  Greek le t te rs  are var iab les  
ranging over possible feature  values, and 
are to be in terpreted  cons is tent ly  w i th in  a 
rule~ but not necessar i ly  between ru les .

that  Greek le t te rs  are also used a~ 
var iab les  fo r  node subsor ipts  ( ru le  (3 ) ) .  
Round braoket~ indioa~e opt iona l i ty  in the 
usual way. Angle braokets ( ru le  (3)) are 
used in the same way as used by e.g. Labor  
(1972: oh. 8) in the  study of 
~oo io l ingu is t io  var ia t ion .  They ind ioate  a 
re la t ionsh ip  between elements on the le f t  
and on the r ight  of the ru le .  The expansion 
on the ~ight  is  only possible i f  the feature  
on the l~!ft of the ru le  has the value 
speo i f ied ,  i f  both are enalosed in angle 
brackets.  In the present ease, they are used 
to prevent the expansion ~f a subdialegue as 
a fu r ther  subdialogue. The feature  ESUBD=-3 
is  introduoed by the ru le  that  expands CONV. 
The ru le  e;?panding DIAL oopies th i s  feature

al lows an expansion of EXCH tQ include 
(opt iona l ly )  one or two DIALs, but i f  the 
DIALs appear, then they oarry the feature  
\[SUBD:+\]. The expansion of such a DIAL by 
ru le  (2) oopies th i s  feature  with th i s  
value, as before,  when the DIAL is  expanded 
to one or more EXCHs. However, sinoe the 
EXCHs  so generat, ed oarry the feature

var iab le .  The same constant  is  used as the 
value of the feature  BASE in subdialogues.  
What th i s  amounts to is  a s t ipu la t ion  that  
the top ic  of a subdialogue is  the EXCH that  
i t  is  par t  o f ,  which seems to be about r ight  
in tu i t ive ly .  This is  what makes  them 
meta l ingu is t io  in character .  Furthermore, 
note that  th i s  is  a case where a 
feature /va lue  pa i r  does not t r i ck le  down. 
This is  tantamount to s t ipu la t ing  that  DIAL 
is  a BASE-bounding node: i t  creates 
" i s lands"  with BASEs that  do not extend 
upwards to  the main d ia logue,  but w i thout  
overwr i t ing  the BASE of the cur rent  main 
d ia logue.  Again, th i s  seems in tu i t ive ly  
cor rect .  
Let us now provide a concrete example of the 
s t ructure  that  these ru les  assign to a 
d ia logue such as (4) .

the constant  IJCAI is  used fo r  the BASE, 
which is  the actual  conference due to  take

given in a l l  re levant  oases, thus g loss ing 
over the fact  that  the BASE could not be 
ident i f ied  immediately,  which is what 
tr iggeeed the subdialogues. We add, 
however ,  neeta in  features  that  wece

MOVE i: U, ()PEN i, REQAFF/REQACT 
HOVE 2: S, CLOSE i~ ~UPPAFF(REQAFF)  
MOVE 3: B, OPEN 21 REQAFF(REQACT) 
MOVE 4: U, CLOSE 2~ SUPPAFF(RESAFF(~E@ACT) 
We new have a way of amcountil lg fo~ the 
sys tem'  s eext  more  (pmint ing) ,  and fec 
expla in ing why anything at a l l  happens. 
MOVE 4 is a SUPPAFF'(REQAFF(REQACT)), i . e?  a 
supp ly  of a f f i rmat ion  in response  to  a 
request  foc a f f i rmat ion  in response  to a 
request  foe  aot ion .  It seems qu i te  g loat  
i n tu i t i ve ly  that  th i s  complex s t ruc ture  is 
equiva lent  "to a REQACT, and we propose that  
th i s  type  of reduct ion  shou ld  take  p lace  by 
ru le .  
39 
However, th i s  ru le  must not over -wr i te  the 
or ig ina l  in terpreta t ion  of the i l l oout ionacy  
force of the move, which must be reta ined 
foc the dialogue to be wel l - formed with 
respect to  the grammar. We propose that  the 
e~feot of th i s  type of ru le  (an imp l ioature  
redundancy ru le )  is  t~ create a hypothet ica l  
move immediately fo l low ing  i t  of the 
appropr iate  type. I t s  e f fec t  is to a l te r  the 
s t ruc ture  of the conversat ion in exact ly  the 
same way as i f  the user ( in  th i s  case) had 
ac tua l ly  ut tered something l i ke  " I  request 
you to p~int the minutes now", except for  
the fac t  that  i t  is  noted that  th i s  is  a 
hypothet i ca l  move. We now have a formal 
ent i ty  that  can t r igger  the pr in t ino  of the 
required text ,  since th i s  is a CLOSure of 
the hypothet ica l  move. I f  no pr in t ing  took 
place, then the  dialogue would be i l l -  
formed, since i t  would contain one OPEN that  
had not been CLOSEd. This, the system is 
behaving as i f  the use~ had made a 
par t i cu la r  move that  did not ac tua l ly  occur. 
(The not ion 'as i f '  is  cent ra l  to 
Va ih inger ' s  (1935) theory of f i c t ions= I t  is  
al~o c ruo ia l  to 6rioean imp l i ca ture . )  
The resu l t  is  that  (4) is now analysed as a 
six-move dia logue,  with the s t ruc ture  shown 
a~ (8). 
MOVE i :  U, OPEN I ,  REQAFFIREQACT

MOVE 5: U, OPEN 3, RE~ACT, hypothet ica l

5. Ant ic ipatory  moves  
Another type of i r=ea l i s  move is an 
ant i c ipatory  move, where on the basis of 
spec i f i c  clues the system ant ic ipates  what 
the user 's  next move w i l l  be. The 
d i f fe rence  between these and hypothet i ca l  
moves is  that  no act ion  is taken by the 
system unt i l  there has been a react ion  from 
the user that  e i ther  confirms or d isoonf i rms 
the correctness of the move that  has been 
ant i c ipated .  The use of such moves w i l l  be 
of assistance in the in terpreta t ion  of 
c rypt i c  fol low-.ups, as in (9).  
u: Can you provide progress repor ts  on LOKI 
subprojeots? 
S: Yes. Do you want to see them? 
U: LOKA 
S: (p r in ts )  
The user 's  second utterance must be 
in terpreted  as a request-for-action, which 
i s  d i f f i cu l t  on formal grounds. Without 
going in to  too much deta i l ,  we propose that  
in such oases ths system should have 
formulated an ant i c ipat ion  of a fo l low ing  
40 
request~for -ac t ion  before the user '~ next 
u t terance .  \]'his could e i ther  be an e ;?p l i c i t  
request=for -ac t ion  ("Please pr in t  the LOKA 
progress repor t " ) ,  or ~imply "Yes" ( i .e .  a 
SUPPAFF(REQAFF(REgACT))), which would 
t r igger  a system request fo r  c la r i f i ca t ion ,  
perhaps, or anything else at  a l l  tha~ can 
serve  to ident i fy  the BASE of the  
ant ic ipated  request - fo r -aCt ion .  This is  the 
important po int  about the ant i c ipat ien~ 
Anything.  at a l l  that  can f i l l  in the 
unspeci f ied ~Iots  in the BASE of the 
ant i c ipated  request - fo r -ac t ion  w i l l  conf i rm 
that  th i s  utterance is intended as a REQACT. 
For th i s  reason~ the bare name LOKA i~ 
enough to get the repor t  p r in ted .  Any other  
su f f i c ient ly  ident i fy ing  descr ip t ion  of the 
re levant  subprc jeot  would have achieved the 
same, such as any of the fo l low ing  <as 
appropr ia te ) :  the one based in Hamburg, 
Hamburg, NL, Max'~ projeot~ most ceeent~ 
etc .  
6.  Conclusions 
The processes and formalisms out l ined  above 
are a l l  tentat ive  in nature,  and represent 
part  of an approach to the problem of 
pragmatic sens i t i v i ty ,  ra ther  than purported 
so lu t ions  to the problem. We envisage then 
as being part  of  a system that  uses a 
mul t i - l eve l  parsing technique, with mutual 
assistance between d i f fe rent  subcomponents 
of the parser,  so that  pragmatic in fo rmat ion  
can immediately be used to ass i s t  par~ing 
i 
fo r  syntax,  and so on. We also see that  
par~ing w i l l  invo lve not only ~entence 
parsing, but also conversat ion pars ing,  in 
that  the appropr iate  s t ruc ture  of a 
conversat ion must be bu i l t  up at  each step.  
This is simply one fu r ther  part  of the 
general parsing process~ but one that  we 
envisage as being of assistance to other  
parser suboomponents, as wel l  as fu l f i l l i ng  
i t s  primary funct ion  of making sure that  the 
system is  something of a conversat iona l i s t ,  
ra ther  than jus t  being a communicative 
plodder.
