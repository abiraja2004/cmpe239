Abstract
We describe a new representation of the
content vocabulary of a text we call word
association profile that captures the pro-
portions of highly associated, mildly asso-
ciated, unassociated, and dis-associated
pairs of words that co-exist in the given
text. We illustrate the shape of the dis-
tirbution and observe variation with genre
and target audience. We present a study
of the relationship between quality of writ-
ing and word association profiles. For a
set of essays written by college graduates
on a number of general topics, we show
that the higher scoring essays tend to have
higher percentages of both highly asso-
ciated and dis-associated pairs, and lower
percentages of mildly associated pairs of
words. Finally, we use word association
profiles to improve a system for automated
scoring of essays.
1 Introduction
The vast majority of contemporary research that
investigates statistical properties of language deals
with characterizing words by extracting infor-
mation about their behavior from large corpora.
Thus, co-occurrence of words in n-word windows,
syntactic structures, sentences, paragraphs, and
even whole documents is captured in vector-space
models built from text corpora (Turney and Pan-
tel, 2010; Basili and Pennacchiotti, 2010; Erk and
Pado?, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Bullinaria
and Levy, 2007; Jones and Mewhort, 2007; Pado
and Lapata, 2007; Lin, 1998; Landauer and Du-
mais, 1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Salton et al,
1975). However, little is known about typical pro-
files of texts in terms of co-occurrence behavior
of their words. Some information can be inferred
from the success of statistical techniques in pre-
dicting certain structures in text. For example, the
fact that a text segmentation algorithm that uses
information about patterns of word co-occurrences
can detect sub-topic shifts in a text (Riedl and Bie-
mann, 2012; Misra et al, 2009; Eisenstein and
Barzilay, 2008) tells us that texts contain some
proportion of more highly associated word pairs
(those in subsequent sentences within the same
topical unit) and of less highly associated pairs
(those in sentences from different topical units).1
Yet, does each text have a different distribution
of highly associated, mildly associated, unassoci-
ated, and dis-associated pairs of words, or do texts
tend to strike a similar balance of these? What
are the proportions of the different levels of asso-
ciation, how much variation there exists, and are
there systematic differences between various kinds
of texts? We present research that makes a first
step in addressing these questions.
From the applied perspective, our interest is in
quantifying differences between well-written and
poorly written essays, for the purposes of auto-
mated scoring of essays. We therefore concentrate
on essay data for the main experiments reported in
this paper, although some additional corpora will
be used for illustration purposes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents our methodology for building word as-
sociation profiles for texts. Section 3 illustrates
the profiles for three corpora from different gen-
res. Section 4.2 presents our study of the relation-
ship between writing quality and patterns of word
associations, with section 4.5 showing the results
of adding a feature based on word association pro-
file to a state-of-art essay scoring system. Related
work is reviewed is section 5.
1Note that the classical approach to topical segmentation
of texts, TextTiling (Hearst, 1997), uses only word repeti-
tions. The cited approaches use topic models that are in turn
estimated using word co-occurrence.

2 Methodology
In order to describe the word association profile
of a text, three decisions need to be made. The
first decision is how to quantify the extent of co-
occurrence between two words; we will use point-
wise mutual information (PMI) estimated from a
large and diverse corpus of texts. The second is
which pairs of words in a text to consider when
building a profile for the text; we opted for all pairs
of content word types occurring in a text, irrespec-
tive of the distance between them. We consider
word types, not tokens; no lemmatization is per-
formed. The third decision is how to represent the
co-occurrence profiles; we use a histogram where
each bin represents the proportion of word pairs in
the given interval of PMI values. The rest of the
section gives more detail about these decisions.
To obtain comprehensive information about
typical co-occurrence behavior of words of
English, we build a first-order co-occurrence
word-space model (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Ba-
roni and Lenci, 2010). The model was generated
from a corpus of texts of about 2.5 billion words,
counting co-occurrence in a paragraph,2 using no
distance coefficients (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007).
About 2 billion words come from the Gigaword
2003 corpus (Graff and Cieri, 2003). Additional
500 million words come from an in-house corpus
containing popular science and fiction texts. Oc-
currence counts of 2.1 million word types and of
1,279 million word type pairs are efficiently com-
pressed using the TrendStream technology (Flor,
2013), resulting in a database file of 4.7GB. Trend-
Stream is a trie-based architecture for storage, re-
trieval, and updating of very large word n-gram
datasets. We store pairwise word associations as
bigrams; since associations are unordered, only
one of the orders in actually stored in the database.
There is an extensive literature on the use of
word-association measures for NLP, especially for
detection of collocations (Pecina, 2010; Evert,
2008; Futagi et al, 2008). The use of point-
wise mutual information with word-space models
is noted in (Zhang et al, 2012; Baroni and Lenci,
2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Turney, 2001).
Point-wise mutual information is defined as fol-
lows (Church and Hanks, 1990):
2In all texts, we use human-marked paragraphs, indicated
either by a new line or by an xml markup.
PMI(x, y) = log2
P (x, y)
P (x)P (y) (1)
Differently from Church and Hanks (1990), we
disregard word order when computing P (x, y).
All probabilities are estimated using frequencies.
We define WAPT ? a word association pro-
file of a text T ? as the distribution of PMI(x, y)
for all pairs of content3 word types (x, y) ?T.
All pairs of word types for which the associations
database returned a null value (the pair has never
been observed in the same paragraph) are ex-
cluded from the calculation. For our main dataset
(described later as setA, section 4.1), the average
percentage of non-null values per text is 92%.
To represent the WAP of a text, we use a 60-bin
histogram spanning all PMI values. The lowest
bin (shown in Figures 1 and 2 as PMI = ?5) con-
tains pairs with PMI??5; the topmost bin (shown
in Figures 1 and 2 as PMI = 4.83) contains pairs
with PMI> 4.67, while the rest of the bins contain
word pairs (x, y) with ?5 <PMI(x, y) ? 4.67.
Each bin in the histogram (apart from the top and
the bottom ones) corresponds to a PMI interval
of 0.167. We chose a relatively fine-grained bin-
ning and performed no optimization for grid selec-
tion; for more sophisticated gridding approaches
to study non-linear relationships in the data, see
Reshef et al (2011).
We will say that a text A is tighter than text
B if the WAP of A is shifted towards the higher
end of PMI values relative to text B. The intuition
behind the terminology is that texts with higher
proportions of highly associated pairs are likelier
to be more focused, dealing with a small num-
ber of topics at greater length, as opposed to texts
that bring various different themes into the text to
various extents. Thus, the text ?The dog barked
and wagged its tail? is much tighter than the text
?Green ideas sleep furiously?, with all the six con-
tent word pairs scoring above PMI=5.5 in the first
and below PMI=2.2 in the second.4
3 Illustration: The shape of the
distribution
For a first illustration, we use a corpus of 5,904
essays written as part of a standardized graduate
3We part-of-speech tag a text using OpenNLP tagger
(http://opennlp.apache.org) and only take into account com-
mon and proper nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
4We omitted colorless from the second example, as color-
less is actually highly associated with green (PMI=4.36).
1149
school admission test (a full descrption of these
data is given in section 4.1, under setA p1-p6). For
each essay, we compute the WAP and represent it
using the 60-bin histogram. For each bin in the
histogram, we compute its average value over the
5,904 essays; additionally, we compute the 15th
and 85th percentiles for each bin, so that the band
between them contains values observed for 70%
of the texts. The series with the solid thick (blue)
line in Figure 1 shows the distribution of the ave-
rage percentage of word type pairs per bin (essays-
av); the dotted lines above and below show the
band capturing the middle 70% of the distribution
(essays-15 and essays-85).
We observe that the shape of the WAP is very
stable across essays, and the variation around the
average is quite limited.
Next, consider the thin solid (green) line with
asterisk-shaped markers in Figure 1 that plots a
similarly-binned histogram for the normal distri-
bution with ?=0.90 and ?=0.66. We note that
for values below PMI=2.17, the normal curve is
within or almost within the 70% band for the essay
data. The divergence occurs at the right tail with
PMI>2.17, that covers, on average, about 8% of
the pairs (5.6% and 10.4% for the 15th and 85th
percentiles, respectively).
To get an idea about possible variation in the
distribution, we consider two additional corpora
from different genres. We use a corpus of Wall
Street Journal 1987 articles from the TIPSTER
collection.5 We picked articles of 250 to 700
words in length, in order to keep the length of texts
comparable to the essay data, while varying the
genre; 770 such articles were found. The dashed
(orange) line in Figure 1 shows the distribution of
average values for the WSJ collection (wsj-av).
We observe that the shape of the distribution is
similar to that of essay data, although WSJ articles
tend to be less tight, on average, since the distribu-
tion in PMI<2.17 area in the WSJ data is shifted
to the left relative to essays. Yet, the picture at the
right tail is remarkably similar to that of the es-
says, with 9% of word pairs, on average, having
PMI>2.17.
The second additional corpus contains 140 lite-
rary texts written or adapted for readers in grades
3 and 4 in US schools (Sheehan et al, 2008).
In terms of length, these texts fall into the same
range as the other corpora, averaging 507 words.
5LDC93T3A in LDC catalogue
The average WAP for these texts is shown with
a thin solid (purple) line with circular markers
in Figure 1 (Grades 3-4). These texts are much
tighter than texts in the other two collections, as
the distribution is shifted to the right. The right
tail, with PMI>2.17, holds 19% of all word pairs
in these texts ? more than twice the proportion
in essays written by college graduates or in texts
from the WSJ.
It is instructive to check whether the over-use
of highly associated pairs is felt during reading.
These texts strike an adult reader as overly ex-
plicit, taking the space to state things that an adult
reader would readily infer or assume. For exam-
ple, consider the following opening paragraph:
?Grandma Rose gave Daniel a recorder.
A recorder is a musical instrument.
Daniel learned to play by blowing on the
recorder. It didn?t take lots of air. It
didn?t take big hands to hold since it was
pocket-sized. His fingers covered the
toneholes just fine. Soon Daniel played
entire songs. His mother loved to lis-
ten. Sometimes she hummed along with
Daniel?s recorder.?
The second and the third sentences state things
that for an adult reader would be too obvious
to need mention. In fact, these sentences al-
most seem like training sentences ? the kind of
sentences from which the associations between
recorder and musical instrument, play, blowing
can be learned. According to Hoey?s theory of
lexical priming (Hoey, 2005), one of the main
functions of schooling is to imbue children with
the societally sanctioned word associations.
To conclude the illustration, we observe that
there are some broad similarities between the dif-
ferent copora in terms of the distribution of pairs
of word types. Thus, texts seem to be mainly made
of pairs of weakly associated words ? about half
the pairs of word types lie between PMI of 0.5
and 1.5, in all the examined collections (52% for
essays, 44% for each of WSJ and young reader
corpora). The percentages of pairs at the low and
the high ends of PMI differ with genre ? writing
for children favors the higher end, while typical
Wall Street Journal writing favors the low end,
relatively to a corpus of essays on general topics
written by college graduates.
These observations are necessarily very tenta-
tive, as only a few corpora were examined. Still,

we believe the illustration is suggestive, in that
there is both constancy in writing for a similar pur-
pose (observe the limited variation around the ave-
rage that captures 70% of the essays) and variation
with genre and target audience. In what follows,
we will explore more thoroughly the information
provided by word association profiles regarding
the quality of writing.
4 Application to Essay Scoring
Texts written for a test and scored by relevant pro-
fessionals is a setting where variation in text qua-
lity is expected. In this section, we report our ex-
periments with using WAPs to explore the varia-
tion in quality as quantified by essay scores. We
first describe the data (section 4.1), then show the
patterns of relationships between essay scores and
word association profiles (section 4.2). Finally,
we report on an experiment where we significantly
improve the performance of a very competitive,
state-of-art system for automated scoring of es-
says, using a feature derived from WAP.
4.1 Data
We consider two collections of essays written as
responses in an analytical writing section of a
high-stakes standardized test for graduate school
admission; the time limit for essay composition
was 45 minutes. Essays were written in response
to a prompt (essay question). A prompt is usually a
general statement, and the test-taker is asked to de-
velop an argument supporting or refuting the state-
ment. Example prompts are: ?High-speed elec-
tronic communications media, such as electronic
mail and television, tend to prevent meaningful
and thoughtful communication? and ?In the age of
television, reading books is not as important as it
once was. People can learn as much by watching
television as they can by reading books.?
The first collection (henceforth, setA) contains
8,899 essays written in response to nine different
prompts, about 1,000 per prompt;6 the per-prompt
subsets will be termed setA-p1 through setA-p9.
Each essay in setA was scored by 1 to 4 human
raters on a scale of 1 to 6; the majority of essays re-
ceived 2 human scores. We use the average of the
available human scores as the gold-standard score
for the essay. Most essays thereby receive an inte-
ger score,7 so the ranking of the essays is coarse.
From this set, p1-p6 were used for feature selec-
tion, data visualization, and estimation of the re-
gression models (training), while sets p7-p9 were
reserved for a blind test.
The second collection (henceforth, setB) con-
6While we sampled exactly 1,000 essays per prompt, we
removed empty responses, resulting in 975 to 1,000 essays
per sample.
7as the two raters agree most of the time
1151
tains 400 essays, with 200 essays written on each
of two prompts given as examples above (setB-p1
and setB-p2). In an experimental study by Attali
et al (2013), each essay was scored by 16 profes-
sional raters on a scale of 1 to 6, allowing plus and
minus scores as well, quantified as 0.33 ? thus, a
score of 4- is rendered as 3.67. This fine-grained
scale resulted in higher mean pairwise inter-rater
correlations than the traditional integer-only scale
(r=0.79 vs around r=0.70 for the operational sco-
ring). We use the average of 16 raters as the final
grade for each essay. This dataset provides a very
fine-grained ranking of the essays, with almost no
two essays getting exactly the same score.

Table 1: Score distribution in the essay data. For
the sake of presentation in this table, all scores
were rounded to integer scores, so a score of 3.33
was counted as 3, and a score of 3.5 was counted
as 4. A cell with the value of .13 (row titled 5
and column titled SetB p1) means that 13% of
the essays in setB-p1 received scores that round
to 5. For setA, average, minimum, and maximum
values across the nine prompts are shown.
Table 1 shows the distribution of rounded scores
in both collections. Average essay scores are be-
tween 3.74 to 3.98 across the different prompts
from both collections. The use of 16 raters seems
to have moved the rounded scores towards the
middle; however, the relative ranking of the essays
is much more delicate in setB than in setA.
4.2 Essay Score vs WAP
We calculated correlations between essay score
and the proportion of word pairs in each of the 60
bins of the WAP histogram, separately for each of
the prompts p1-p6 in setA. For a sample of 1,000
instances, a correlation of r=0.065 is significant at
p = 0.05. Figure 2 plots the correlations.
First, we observe that, perhaps contrary to ex-
pectation, the proportion of the highest values of
PMI (the area to the right of PMI=4 in Figure 2)
does not yield a consistent correlation with essay
scores. Thus, inasmuch as highest PMI values
tend to capture multi-word expressions (South and
Africa; Merill and Lynch), morphological vari-
ants (bids and bidding), or synonyms (mergers
and takeovers), their proportion in word type pairs
does not seem to give a clear signal regarding the
quality of writing.8
In contrast, the area of moderately high PMI
values (from PMI=2.5 to PMI=3.67 in Figure 2)
produces a very consistent picture, with only two
points out of 48 in that interval9 lacking signif-
icant positive correlation with essay score (p2 at
PMI=3.17 and p5 at PMI=3).
Next, observe the consistent negative correla-
tions between essay score and the proportion of
word pairs in bins PMI=0.833 through PMI=1.5.
Here again, out of the 30 data points correspond-
ing to these values, only 3 failed to reach statistical
significance, although the trend there is still nega-
tive.
Finally, there is a trend towards a positive cor-
relation between essay scores and the proportion
of mildly negative PMI values (-2<PMI<0), that
is, better essays tend to use more pairs of dis-
associated words, although this trend is not as
clear-cut as the one on the right-hand side of the
distribution.
Assuming that a higher proportion of high PMI
pairs corresponds to more topic development and
that a higher proportion of negative PMIs corre-
ponds to more creative use of language (in that
pairs are chosen that do not generally tend to ap-
pear together), it seems that the better essays are
both more topical and more creative than the lower
scoring ones. In what follows, we check whether
the information about essay quality provided by
WAP can be used to improve essay scoring.
8It is also possible that some of the instances with very
high PMI are pairs that contain low frequency words for
which the database predicts a spuriously high PMI based on a
single (and a-typical) co-occurrence that happens to repeat in
an essay ? similar to the Schwartz eschews example in (Man-
ning and Schu?tze, 1999, Table 5.16, p. 181). On the one
hand, we do not expect such pairs to occur in any systematic
pattern, so they could obscure an otherwise more systematic
pattern in the high PMI bins. On the other hand, we do not
expect to see many such pairs, simply because a repetition
of an a-typical event is likely to be very rare. We thank an
anonymous reviewer for suggesting this direction, and leave
a more detailed examination of the pairs in the highest-PMI
bins to future work.
9There are 8 bins of width of 0.167 in the given interval,
with 6 datapoints per bin.

4.3 Baseline
As a baseline, we use e-rater (Attali and Burstein,
2006), a state-of-art essay scoring system deve-
loped at Educational Testing Service.10 E-rater
computes more than 100 micro-features, which are
aggregated into macro-features aligned with spe-
cific aspects of the writing construct. The system
incorporates macro-features measuring grammar,
usage, mechanics, style, organization and develop-
ment, lexical complexity, and vocabulary usage.
Table 2 gives examples of micro-features covered
by the different macro-features.
E-rater models are built using linear regression
on large samples of test-taker essays. We use a
generic e-rater model built at Educational Testing
Service using essays across a variety of writing
prompts, with no connection to the current project
and its authors. This model obtains Pearson corre-
lations of r=0.8324-0.8721 with the human scores
on setA, and the staggering r=0.9191 and r=0.9146
with the human scores on setB-p1 and setB-p2,
respectively. This is a very competitive baseline,
as e-rater features explain more than 70% of the
variation in essay scores on a relatively coarse
scale (setA) and more than 80% of the variation
in scores on a fine-grained scale (setB).

4.4 Adding WAP
We define HAT ? high associative tight-
ness ? as the percentage of word type pairs
with 2.33<PMI?3.67 (bins PMI=2.5 through
PMI=3.67). This range correponds to the longest
sequence of adjacent bins in the PMI>0 area that
had a positive correlation with essay score in the
setA-p1 set. The HAT feature attains significant
1153
(at p = 0.05) correlations with essay scores,
r=0.11 to r=0.27 for the prompts in setA, and
r=0.22 and r=0.21 for the two prompts in setB. We
note that the HAT feature is not correlated with es-
say length. Essay length is not used as a feature in
e-rater models, but it typically correlates strongly
with the human essay score (at about r=0.70 in our
data), as well as with the score provided by e-rater
(at about r=0.80).
We also explored a feature that captured the
area with the negative correlations identified in
section 4.2. This feature did not succeed in im-
proving the performance over the baseline on setA
p1-p6; we tentatively conclude that information
contained in that feature, i.e. the proprotion of
mildly associated vocabulary in an essay, is indi-
rectly captured by another feature or group of fea-
tures already present in e-rater. Likewise, a feature
that calculates the average PMI for all pairs of con-
tent word types in the text failed to produce an im-
provement over the baseline for setA p1-p6. The
reason for this can be observed in Figure 2: The
higher-scoring essays having more of both the low
and the high PMI pairs leads to about the same
average PMI as for the lower-scoring essays that
have a higher concentration of values closer to the
average PMI.
4.5 Evaluation
To evaluate the usefulness of WAP in improving
automated scoring of essays, we estimate a lin-
ear regression model using the human score as a
dependent variable (label) and e-rater score and
the HAT as the two independent variables (fea-
tures). The correlations between the two inde-
pendent variables (e-rater and HAT) are between
r=0.11 and r=0.24 on the prompts in setA and
setB.
We estimate a regression model on each of
setA-pi, i ? {1, .., 6}, and evaluate them on each
of setA-pj, j ? {7, .., 9}, and compare the perfor-
mance with that of e-rater alone on setA-pj. Note
that e-rater itself is not trained on any of the data
in setA and setB; we use the same e-rater model
for all evaluations, a generic model that was pre-
trained on a large number of essays across diffe-
rent prompts. For setB, we estimate the regression
model on setB-p1 and test on setB-p2, and vice
versa.
Table 3 shows the evaluation results. The HAT
feature leads to a statistically significant improve-

Table 3: Performance of baseline model (e-rater)
and models where e-rater was augmented with
HAT, a feature based on the word association
profile. Performance is measured using Pearson
correlation with essay score. We use Wilcoxon
Signed-Ranked test for matched pairs, and report
the sum of signed ranks (W), the number of ranks
(n), and the p value. E-rater+HAT is significantly
better than e-rater alone, W=138, n=20, p<0.05.
We also measure significance of the improvement
for each row individually, using McNemar?s test
for significance of difference in same-sample cor-
relations (McNemar, 1955, p.148); we report the
t value for each test. For values of t > 1.645,
we can reject the hypothesis that e-rater+HAT is
not better than e-rater alone with 95% confidence.
Significant improvements are underlined.

ment in the performance of automated scoring.
An improvement is observed for 14 out of the 18
evaluations for setA, as well as for both evalua-
tions for setB.11 Moreover, the largest relative im-
provement of 0.55%, from 0.9191 to 0.9242, was
observed for the setting with the highest baseline
performance, suggesting that the HAT feature is
still effective even after the delicate ranking of
the essays revealed an exceptionally strong perfor-
mance of e-rater.
5 Related Work
Most of the attention in the computational linguis-
tics research that deals with analysis of the lexis
of texts has so far been paid to what in our terms
would be the very high end of the word associa-
tion profile. Thus, following Halliday and Hasan
(1976), Hoey (1991), and Morris and Hirst (1991),
the notion of lexical cohesion has been used to
capture repetitions of words and occurrence of
words with related meanings in a text. Lexically
cohesive words are traced through the text, for-
ming lexical chains or graphs, and these repre-
sentations are used in a variety of applications,
such as segmentation, keyword extraction, sum-
marization, sentiment analysis, temporal indexing,
hypelink generation, error correction (Guinaudeau
et al, 2012; Marathe and Hirst, 2010; Ercan and
Cicekli, 2007; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; Hirst
and Budanitsky, 2005; Inkpen and De?silets, 2005;
Gurevych and Strube, 2004; Stokes et al, 2004;
Silber and McCoy, 2002; Green, 1998; Al-Halimi
and Kazman, 1998; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).
To our knowledge, lexical cohesion has not so far
been used for automated scoring of essays. Our
results suggest that this direction is promising, as
merely the proportion of highly associated word
pairs is already contributing a clear signal regar-
ding essay quality; it is possible that additional
information can be derived from richer represen-
tations common in the lexical cohesion literature.
Aspects related to the distribution of words in
essays have been studied in relation to essay sco-
ring. One line of work focuses on assessing co-
herence of essays. Foltz et al (1998) use Latent
11We also performed a cross-validation test on setA p1-
p6, where we estimated a regression model on setA-pi and
evaluate it on setA-pj, for all i, j ? {1, .., 6}, i 6= j, and
compared the performance with that of e-rater alone on setA-
pj, yielding 30 different train-test combinations. The results
were similar to those of the blind test presented here, with e-
rater+HAT significantly improving upon e-rater alone, using
Wilcoxon test, W=374, n=29, p<0.05.
Semantic Analysis to model the smoothness of
transitions between adjacent segments of an essay.
Higgins et al (2004) compare sentences from cer-
tain discourse segments in an essay to determine
their semantic similarity, such as comparing the-
sis statements to conclusions or thesis statements
to essay prompts. Additional approaches include
evaluation of coherence based on repeated refe-
rence to entities (Burstein et al, 2010; Barzilay
and Lapata, 2008; Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004).
Our approach is different in that it does not mea-
sure the flow of the text, that is, the sequencing
and repetition of the words, but rather assesses the
choice of vocabulary as a whole.
Topic models have been proposed as a tech-
nique for capturing clusters of related words that
tend to occur in the same documents in a given
collection. A text is modeled as being composed
of a small number of topics, and words in the text
are generated conditioned on the selected topics
(Gruber et al, 2007; Blei et al, 2003). Since
(a) topics encapsulate clusters of highly associated
words, and (b) topics for a given text are modeled
as being chosen independently from each other,
we expect a negative correlation between the num-
ber of topics in a document and the tightness of the
word association profile of the text.
An alternative representation of word associ-
ation profile would be a weighted graph, where
the weights correspond to pairwise associations
between words. Thus, for longer texts, graph
analysis techniques would be applicable. Steyvers
and Tenenbaum (2005) analyze the graphs in-
duced from large repositories like WordNet or
databases of free associations, and find them to be
scale-free and small-world; it is an open question
whether word association graphs induced from
book-length texts would exhibit similar properties.
In the theoretical tradition, our work is closest in
spirit to Michael Hoey?s theory of lexical priming
(Hoey, 2005), positing that users of language inter-
nalize patterns of occurrence and non-occurrence
of words not only with other words, but also in cer-
tain positions in a text, in certain syntactic environ-
ments, and in certain evaluative contexts, and use
these when creating their own texts. We believe
that word association profiles reflect the artwork
that goes into using those internalized associations
between words when creating a text, achieving the
right mix of strong and weak, positive and nega-
tive associations.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we described a new representation
of the content vocabulary of a text we call word
association profile that captures the proportions
of highly associated, mildly associated, unassoci-
ated, and dis-associated pairs of words selected to
co-exist in the given text by its author. We ob-
served that the shape of the distribution is quite
stable across various texts, with about half the
pairs having a mild association; the allocation of
pairs to the higher and the lower levels of associa-
tion does vary across genres and target audiences.
We further presented a study of the relationship
between quality of writing and word association
profiles. For a dataset of essays written by college
graduates on a number of general topics in a stan-
dardized test for graduate school admission and
scored by professional raters, we showed that the
higher scoring essays tend to have higher percen-
tages of both highly associated and dis-associated
pairs, and lower percentagese of mildly associated
pairs of words. We hypothesize that this pattern
is consistent with the better essays demonstrating
both a better topic development (hence the higher
percentage of highly related pairs) and a more cre-
ative use of language resources, as manifested in a
higher percentage of word pairs that generally do
not tend to appear together.
Finally, we demonstrated that the information
provided by word association profiles leads to a
significant improvement in a highly competitive,
state-of-art essay scoring system that already mea-
sures various aspects of writing quality.
In future work, we intend to investigate in more
detail the contribution of various kinds of words to
word association profiles, as well as pursue appli-
cation to evaluation of text complexity.
