Abstract 
One of the problems for all speech input is the 
necessity for the talker to be encumbered by a head. 
mounted, hand-held, or fixed position microphone. An 
intelfigent, electronically-aimed unidirectional micro- 
phone would overcome this problem. Array tech- 
niques hold the best promise to bring such a system to 
practicality. The development of a robust algorithm to 
determine the location of a talker is a fundamental is- 
sue for a microphone-array s stem. Here, a two-step 
talker-location algorithm is introduced. Step 1 is a 
rather conventional filtered cross-correlation method; 
the cross-correlation between some pair of micro- 
phones is determined to high accuracy using a some- 
what novel, fast interpolation on the sampled data. 
Then, using the fact that the delays for a point source 
should fit a hyperbola, a best hyperbolic fit is obtained 
using nonlinear optimization. A method which fits the 
hyperbola directly to peak-picked elays is shown to 
be far less robust than an algorithm which fits the hy- 
perbola in the cross-correlation space. An efficient, 
global nonlinear optimization technique, Stochastic re- 
gion Contraction (SRC) is shown to yield highly accu- 
rate (>90%), and computationally efficient, results for 
a normal ambient. 
Introduction 
One of the problems for all speech input is the 
necessity for the talker to be encumbered by a hcad- 
mounted, hand-held, or fixed position microphone, or, 
perhaps, a technician-conlxolled mechanical unidirectional 
microphone. Whether for teleconferencing \[I\], speech 
recognition \[2\], or large-room recording or conferencing 
\[3\], an intelligent, eleclronically-aimed unidirectional mi- 
crophone would overcome this problem. Array tech- 
niques hold the best promise to bring such a system to 
practicality. 
Algorithms for passive tracking -- the determina- 
tion of range, bearing, speed, and signature as a function 
of time for a moving object -- have been studied for near- 
ly 100 years partiomLqrly for radar and sonar systems. 
While there is currently much activity involved with the 
wacking of multiple sources using variants of the 
eigenvalue-hased decomposition MUSIC algorithm, \[4\], 
\[5\], \[6\], \[7\], \[8\], most systems till use correlational tech- 
niques \[9\], \[10\], [11\]. 
The method presented here is also based on correla- 
tion. First, a coarse, normalized cross-correlation func- 
tion is computed over the delay range of interest. It turns 
out that, even for the relatively high sampfing rate of 
20kHz, the 5Olas resolution of the time-delay estimates 
causes derived locations to be unsatisfactory. However, 
the latter may be refined by nearly two orders of magni- 
tude through accurate interpolation techniques which can 
be attained for a relatively small computational using 
multirate filtering\[12\]. 
For M microphones, one can estimate M-1 in- 
dependent relative delays. As, theoretically, only two re- 
lative delays are needed to triangulate a source, for M >3, 
the system is overspecified. However, since noise is al- 
ways present in a real system, this extra information can 
be profitably used to overcome some of the effects of the 
noise. In fact, the geometry of the array constrains the 
vector of relative delays. For example, a simple linear 
array, with all the microphones on the axis, y=0, has de- 
lays constrained to be on a particular hyperbola with a 
focus on the target. Therefore, errors in the estimation of 
the delays may be corrected by fitting the best hyperbola. 
Two methods for doing so are presented here. 
In the first method, Time-Delay Estimation, Hy- 
perbolic Fit (TDEHF), peak-picking is used on the 
results of the interpolated cross-correlations to estimate 
the individual time delays. Then, constrained nonfincar 
optimization is used to fit the best hyperbola through the 
sparse rime-delay estimations. As the data turn out to be 
pretty much unimodal, gradient techniques \[13\] were used 
to minimize a least-squares functional. TDEHF suffers 
when original time-delay estimates exhibit large, and 
151 
often "dumb" errors. TDEHF is introduced in Section 4. 
The second (and more robust) method Interpolated 
Cross-eorrelation Hyperbolic Fit (ICHF), fits the best 
hyperbola to the actual output of the interpolated cross- 
correlations. As reasonable crosscorrelations are always 
positive, the sum of the crosscorrelations across all the 
microphones for a given hyperbola is used as a functional 
to maximize. As the functional surface is multimodal, 
results for a hierarchical grid search and for application of 
Stochastic Region Contraction (SRC), [14] , [IS], a new 
method for efficient global nonlinear optimization, are 
presented. 
Coarse Cross-Correlation 
Consider a linear microphone array having M mi- 
crophones, each located on the line y = O  at a distinct 
point (z,,O) in the x y  plane. A simple case is to be 
considered in this paper in which a single some (talker) 
is located at some point (x,y) in frdnt of the array. 
although there will be ambient noise. Without loss of 
generality, microphone 1 is selected as the reference. It 
is assumed that the signal at each microphone is appropri- 
ately sampled at some reasonable rate, R and that each 
microphone thus receives a signal of time (indexed by j). 
p:~). As sources might be separable in the frequency 
domain, one can, in general, filter each received signal 
using a zero-phase FIR filter, this is the only reasonable 
choice as delay estimation is yet to be performed. This 
implies, 
where f , G )  is a 2J+1 element symmetric FIR filter. It 
is advantageous, as will be seen later, to define 
rectangularly-windowed data, referenced to time index k', 
for the correlations as, 
O I I  IL-1 
otherwise (2.2) 
Each of the M-1 independent cross-correlations for 
a delay of k samples each of duration 1IR may be 
defined, 
A,(k') L-1 
C:[k,k'I 7 x r :  (k '+l )$(k'+l +k), (2.3) L - lkl 
where A,(k') is a normalizing factor. A reasonable nor- 
malization is to make the autocorrelation of the unshifted 
reference signal have a value of unity for any particular 
time reference k ', 
Combining (2.3) and (2.4) gives, 
which generalizes to, 
Computational Considerations for the Cross- 
Correlations 
An important consideration is the selection of L. 
the number of points in the crosscorrelation. When auto- 
correlations are taken for LPC analysis, the length is lim- 
ited by the assumption that the vocal tract is essentially 
stationary over the interval. As one is not doing this 
pseudo-stationary modeling of the vocal tract, this fact 
does not limit L here. Rather, the tradeoff between infor- 
mation content - tending to make one increase L - and 
computational load -- tending to make one decrease L -- 
governs this decision. For the typical human talker, com- 
puting a position about five times per second is sufficient. 
With no redundancy, selecting L to correspond to 100- 
200ms of data is reasonable, as the experimental data 
show. 
The range of the correlations, [-K-, K+], may be 
determined from the sample rate and the geometry shown 
in Figure 1 for a onedimensional array. For a symmetric 
arrangement in a room. K- = K+ and 
R K- = K+ = rkngth -cos(O)-1.

As an example, consider a one-dimensional array of 
length one meter, a room four meters wide, one-half me- 
ter of "block-out space" and a sampling rate of 20,000 
samples-per-second. For this case, correlations will re- 
quire 2000 multiplication-addition operations for lOOmsec 
of data. As the maximum relative delay may be seen to 
be 1'C0S140 = 2.84m.s. Equation (2.7) yields

K- = K+ = 57. Thus, the correlation phase requires

done directly or just under 20ms of computation time us- 
ing the Analog Devices ADSP-2100A digital signal pro- 
cessor at 12.5MHz clock rate \[16\]. For eight micro- 
phones, about 160 ms would be required, and the location 
could be computed in real-dine for the required five up- 
dates per second. 
The relative delay between each microphone and its 
reference could be estimated by selecting the highest po- 
sitive point in the correlation outputs, i.e., 
k=* -= argmin C~\[k,k'\], (2.8) 
-.K_ ~l ~K+ 
k:, (2.9) d, tk q - "T' 
where d,~ \[k'\] is defined to be the delay, relative to micro- 
phone 1, for microphone m. Note that the accuracy is 
only to that of the sample rate, and that this simple peak- 
picking algorithm is subject to serious errors when real 
data are used! 
Interpolation for Higher Accuracy 
Even for the relatively high (for speech) sampling 
rate of 20kHz, estimation accuracy of the tracking posi- 
tion is inadequate; a variation of more than one meter in 
the y dimension is the norm for talkers two meters direct- 
ly in front of the microphone. Experience has shown that 
an acceptable region of uncertainty may be achieved for a 
sampling inteerval of about llas. 
The most straightforward way to achieve the need- 
ed high resolution would be to sample at a much higher 
rate, R" -- around 1MHz - and perform the correlations 
on the data, i.e., 
C,~'\[k,kq= B.(k3 LR'-~ E r~'(k'+l).r~'(k'+k+l)(3.1) LtC--lk l I=o 
where B,(k ' )  is a normalizing factor and L R' is the 
number of high-resolution samples in L. Relative to 
20kHz sampling, this would force the computation to in- 
crease by a factor of 502 = 2500, making the procedure 
absurd. For an appropriately anti-aliased speech signal, 
one would be dealing with greatly oversampled signals. 
Thus, with no loss in accuracy, one could generate the 
signal at sampling rate R '  from the signal sampled at rate 
R by the simplest standard multirate method if

Computational Considerations for the Inter- 
polation 
One important aspect of the computation of Equa- 
tion (3.3) is the storage requirement for O. Appropriate 
resolution is achieved for Z=64, R=20k.Hz and a filter 
length of 641, implying QR =5. Then the range of oi 
and 02 is only 11. Thus (11)(11)(64) = 7744 storage lo- 
cations are required. 
The number of multiplication-additions is 
(11)2= 121 to compute the cross-correlation for each in- 
terpolated point. One should note that this number is a 
far cry from the "direct" method in which, for L = 2000, 
(621)(64)(2000) = 80,000,000 operations had to be done 
to get each interpolated signal and (64)(2000) = 128,000 
operations had to be done for each interpolated cross- 
correlation! 
Best Hyperbolic Fit Algorithms 
Triangulation 
In binaural hearing, both amplitude and phase infor- 
marion is fed to the ~ and is used -- expertly -- to 
determine the location of a sound source. If the phase in- 
formation -- the delay estimates - alone were to be used 
to determine location of a source, a minimum of three 
microphones i required for this "triangulation" procedure. 
If microphone 1 is considered to be the reference, and d2 
and d3 the time delays for microphones 2 and 3 respec- 
tively, relative to the arrival at microphone 1, then the es- 
timation of the source location xo, Yo may be determined 
from, 
? 2d 22 (d2 - d 3)-d 2(z 32-z 12 ) + d 3(z 22-z 12 )
x0 = 2\[d2(z 1 -z 3) - d3(z 1-z 2)\] (4.1) 
12 
YO = t~ ~ j -(Xo-Zl)2J . (4 .2 )  
(One should note that these triangulation formulae are 
normally listed for polar coordinates.) These relatively 
ugly, nonlinear expressions tend to be very sensitive to 
variations due to noise in the estimates of d2 and d3.

T ime-De lay  Est imat ion,  Hyperbo l ic  Fit 
(TDEHF)  
For the case of the linear array, where the micro- 
phones are all considered to be on y=0, the locus of the 
relative delays for points along this line forms a hyperbo- 
la. This is clear from Figure 2 in which the relative de- 
lay loci are plotted for various point-source locations 
(x,y). At (zm,0), the absolute delay d= may be comput- 
ed from the Pythagorean Theorem as 
dm - "~\ ] (X -z2)+y2 (4.3) 
C,  
and, relative to microphone 1, 
d,~ = ~l(x-zm)2+y2 dr. (4.4) 
C 
Some algebra yields, 
(d,~+dl) 2 - (Zm-X)2 = ~ (4.5) 
C 2 C 2 " 
The points (z=,d.)  lie on a hyperbola parameterized by 
the speed of sound, c, and the location of the source, 
(x,y). Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between a
specific hyperbola and a source-point (x,y) located in 
front of the array -- there is a mirror in back of the array. 
The task, then, is to fit the best member of this class, the 
best hyperbola, to the set of relative delay estimates

In TDEHF an estimate of the relative delay for 
each microphone is obtained by peak-picking as indicated 
by Equations (2.10) and (2.11). Interpolation is done lo- 
cally to get a higher resolution estimate, d,~'(k'). While 
many criteria are possible, a typical squared-error meas- 
ure is defined as

been used. 
Interpolated Cross -cor re la t ion  Hyperbo l i c  Fit 
( ICHF)  
When real data are used, it is often the case that the 
cross-correlation peak which must be determined in 
TDEHF is inappropriate. This is due to 1) periodicity in 
the signal, 2) room reverberations, and 3) noise. A more 
robust algorithm would clearly resdt ff the specific deter- 
mination of the delays did not have to be explicitly done. 
In ICHF, one tries to determine the "optimal:fit" hyperbo- 
la in the cross.correlation space itself; thus, no pattern 
recognition errors are made prior to the optimization. 
Plots for real data are presented in Figures 3 and 4. 
In each case, the d at~ are produced by a loud talker si- 
tuated at (1M,2M) with low ambient noise. In Figure 3, 
TDEHF worked well, as the peaks are relatively easy to 
pick correctly. In Figure 4, however, TDEHF yielded 
poor results, although it is evident hat a hyperbolic fit in 
the cross-correlation space itself could give the right loca- 
tion.

In nonlinear optimization, one must develop a func- 
tional that measures "goodness (badness)" as a function of 
the set of variables over which one wants to optimize. In 
this case, one wants to develop a measure of the average 
"goodness" of a particular hyperbola parametefized by 
(x,y) over the space shown in Figures 3, 4 having in- 
dependent variables of x, the x spatial variable, and if, 
the relative delay. Points for the microphones (z,,,,d,,) 
may be computed from Equations 4.3 and 4.4; this 
guarantees they all lie on a unique hyperbola. If a con- 
tinuous cross-correlation function, C (x, d) were available, 
then a reasonable functional for maximization would be,

note that it would be expected that the value should be 
positive for reasonable situations, and approaching unity 
for ideal ones, and thus/~ (k') could also be used to thres- 
hold decisions.

As no continuous cross-correlation function is avail- 
able, one must approximate it. It is assumed that interpo-

one determines Om and v .  from d,~ using,

which is exactly as derived previously. A three dimen- 
sional plot of the surface for E (k 3 is given in Figure 5. 
Notice the strong peaking due to the hyperbolic-fit 
transformation. 
Results  
Some preliminary results for one loud talker stand- 
ing at (1M,2M) with a low ambient are shown in Figures 
6 and 7. A linear array of eight microphones was used 
for all cases. For these Figures, an algorithm was as- 
sumed to have c(rrecfly located the talker ff it indicated a
location within the rectangular region from 1.9M to 2.1M 
in x and 1.5M to 2.5M in y. As algorithms have im- 
proved, the measure of "correctness" is also to be refined 
in further work. In both TDEHF and ICHF, the tendency 
is for better per fo rmance  when larger-size cross- 
correlations are used, although there seems to be no rea- 
son to go beyond 3500 samples (175ms). It is also clear 
that ICHF is far more robust than is TDEHF. Further- 
more, as might be expected, one gets improved perfor- 
mance using bandpass-filtered data. (The filter used is a 
61-tap, symmetric FIR filter having transition bands 
(400Hz -900Hz) and (3300HZ-3800)Hz; stopbands are 
50dB down.)

There is high correlation between "correctness" and 
the resultant value of/~ \[k q for ICHF. Therefore, it is ex- 
pected that, in regions where the algorithm fails -- 
perhaps in silence or a high-ambient interval -- the value 
of E\[k'\] would be low and the incorrect location would 
not be accepted. Given this thresholding, one would ex- 
pect to almost always get an accurate prediction of a 
talker's location, providing no other talkers are competing 
acoustically, a case not yet studied. 
Computationally, ICHF is implementable in real- 
time due to the use of Stochastic Region Contraction \[14\] 
for the nonlinear optimization. Relative to a coarse-fine 
full search, SRC has provided an order-of-magnitude im- 
155 
pmvement with virtl,aUy no loss in accuracy.

Conclusion 
A very promising algorithm for determining the lo- 
cation of a talker in a real acoustic environment has been 
introduced. In an uncontested acoustic environment, prel- 
iminary results from real data indicate that highly accu- 
rate performance is achievable. In addition, the SRC 
method for nonlinear optimization has provided a 
mechanism for making the algorithm practical in real 
time. In follow-on work, more data have to be tested, 
multiple talker and various noise environments need to be 
explored, and extensions to tracking need to be 
developed. However, the current level of performance 
tends to predict hat these aspects will go smoothly.
