Abstract
We present a novel approach to the unsu-
pervised detection of affixes, that is, to ex-
tract a set of salient prefixes and suffixes
from an unlabeled corpus of a language.
The underlying theory makes no assump-
tions on whether the language uses a lot
of morphology or not, whether it is pre-
fixing or suffixing, or whether affixes are
long or short. It does however make the
assumption that 1. salient affixes have to
be frequent, i.e occur much more often
that random segments of the same length,
and that 2. words essentially are vari-
able length sequences of random charac-
ters, e.g a character should not occur in
far too many words than random without
a reason, such as being part of a very fre-
quent affix. The affix extraction algorithm
uses only information from fluctation of
frequencies, runs in linear time, and is free
from thresholds and untransparent itera-
tions. We demonstrate the usefulness of
the approach with example case studies on
typologically distant languages.
1 Introduction
The problem at hand can be described as follows:
Input : An unlabeled corpus of an arbitrary natural
language
Output : A (possibly ranked) set of prefixes and
suffixes corresponding to true prefixes and suf-
fixes in the linguistic sense, i.e well-segmented
and with grammatical meaning, for the lan-
guage in question.
Restrictions : We consider only concatenative mor-
phology and assume that the corpus comes al-
ready segmented on the word level.
The theory and practice of the problem is relevant
or even essential in fields such as child language ac-
quisition, information retrieval and, of course, the
fuller scope of computational morphology and its
further layers of application (e.g Machine Transla-
tion).
The reasons for attacking this problem in an un-
supervised manner include advantages in elegance,
economy of time and money (no annotated resources
required), and the fact that the same technology may
be used on new languages.
An outline of the paper is as follows: we start
with some notation and basic definitions, with which
we describe the theory that is intended to model
the essential behaviour of affixation in natural lan-
guages. Then we describe in detail and with ex-
amples the thinking behind the affix extraction al-
gorithm, which actually requires only a few lines to
define mathematically. Next, we present and discuss
some experimental results on typologically different
languages. The paper then finishes with a brief but
comprehensive characterization of related work and
its differences to our work. At the very end we state
the most important conclusions and ideas on future
components of unsupervised morphological analy-
sis.

2 A Naive Theory of Affixation
Notation and definitions:
? w, s, b, x, y, . . . ? ??: lowercase-letter vari-
ables range over strings of some alphabet? and
are variously called words, segments, strings,
etc.
? s / w: s is a terminal segment of the word w
i.e there exists a (possibly empty) string x such
that w = xs
? W,S, . . . ? ??: capital-letter variables range
over sets of words/strings/segments
? fW (s) = |{w ? W |s / w}|: the number of
words in W with terminal segment s
? SW = {s|s / w ? W}: all terminal segments
of the words in W
? | ? |: is overloaded to denote both the length of
a string and the cardinality of a set
Assume we have two sets of random strings over
some alphabet ?:
? Bases B = {b1, b2, . . . , bm}
? Suffixes S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}
Such that:
Arbitrary Character Assumption (ACA) Each
character c ? ? should be equally likely in any
word-position for any member of B or S.
Note that B and S need not be of the same car-
dinality and that any string, including the empty
string, could end up belonging to both B and S.
They need neither to be sampled from the same
distribution; pace the requirement, the distributions
from which B and S are drawn may differ in how
much probability mass is given to strings of different
lengths. For instance, it would not be violation if B
were drawn from a a distribution favouring strings
of length, say, 42 and S from a distribution with a
strong bias for short strings.
Next, build a set of affixed words W ? {bs|b ?
B, s ? S}, that is, a large set whose members are
concatenations of the form bs for b ? B, s ? S,
such that:
Frequent Flyer Assumption (FFA) : The mem-
bers of S are frequent. Formally: Given any
s ? S: fW (s) >> fW (x) for all x such that 1.
|x| = |s|; and 2. not x / s? for all s? ? S).
In other words, if we call s ? S a true suffix and we
call x an arbitrary segment if it neither a true suffix
nor the terminal segment of a true suffix, then any
true suffix should have much higher frequency than
an arbitrary segment of the same length.
One may legimately ask to what extent words of
real natural languages fit the construction model of
W , with the strong ACA and FFA assumptions, out-
lined above. For instance, even though natural lan-
guages often aren?t written phonemically, it is not
hard to come up with languages that have phonotac-
tic constraints on what may appear at the beginning
or end of a word, e.g, Spanish *st- may not begin
a word and yields est- instead. Another violation
of ACA is that (presumably all (Ladefoged, 2005))
languages disallow or disprefer a consonant vs. a
vowel conditioned by the vowel/consonant status of
its predecessor. However, if a certain element occurs
with less frequency than random (the best example
would be click consonants which, in some languages
e.g Eastern !Xo?o (Traill, 1994), occur only initially),
this is not a problem to the theory.
As for FFA, we may have breaches such as Bibli-
cal Aramaic (Rosenthal, 1995) where an old -a? el-
ement appears on virtually everywhere on nouns,
making it very frequent, but no longer has any syn-
chronic meaning. Also, one can doubt the require-
ment that an affix should need to be frequent; for
instance, the Classical Greek inflectional (lacking
synchronic internal segmentation) alternative medial
3p. pl. aorist imperative ending -???? (Blomqvist
and Jastrup, 1998), is not common at all.
Just how realistic the assumptions are is an empir-
ical question, whose answer must be judged by ex-
periments on the relevant languages. In the absense
of fully annotated annotated test sets for diverse lan-
guages, and since the author does not have access to
the Hutmegs/CELEX gold standard sets for Finnish
and English (Creutz and Linde?n, 2004), we can only
give some guidelining experimental data.
ACA On a New Testament corpus of Basque
(Leizarraga, 1571) we computed the probabil-
ity of a character appearing in the initial, sec-

ond, third or fourth position of the word. Since
Basque is entirely suffixing, if it complied to
ACA, we?d expect the distributions to be simi-
lar. However, if we look at the difference of the
distributions in terms of variation distance be-
tween two probability distributions (||p? q|| =
1
2
?
x |p(x) ? q(x)|), it shows that they dif-
fer considerably ? especially the initial position
proves more special (see table 1).
FFA As for the FFA, we checked a corpus of bible
portions of Warlpiri (Yal, 1968 2001). This was
chosen because it is one of the few languages
known to the author where data was available
and which has a decent amount of frequent suf-
fixes which are also long, e.g case affixes are
typically bisyllabic phonologically and five-ish
characters long orthographically. Since the or-
thography used marked segmentation, it was
easy to compute FFA statistics on the words
as removed from segmentation marking. Com-
paring with the lists in (Nash, 1980, Ch. 2) it
turns out that FFA is remarkably stable for all
grammatical suffixes occuring in the outermost
layer. There are however the expected kind
of breaches; e.g a tense suffix -ku combined
with a last vowel -u which is frequent in some
frequent preceding affixes making the terminal
segment -uku more frequent than some genuine
three-letter suffixes.
The language known to the author which has
shown the most systematic disconcord with the
FFA is Haitian Creole (also in bible corpus
experiments (Hai, 2003 1999)). Haitian cre-
ole has very little morphology of its own but
owes the lion?s share of it?s words from French.
French derivational morphemes abound in
these words, e.g -syon, which have been care-
fully shown by (Lefebvre, 2004) not to be pro-
ductive in Haitian Creole. Thus, the little mor-
phology there is in Haitian creole is very dif-
ficult to get at without also getting the French
relics.
3 An Algorithm for Affix Extraction
The key question is, if words in natural languages
are constructed as W explained above, can we re-
cover the segmentation? That is, can we find B and
S, given only W ? The answer is yes, we can par-
tially decide this. To be more specific, we can com-
pute a score Z such that Z(x) > Z(y) if x ? SW
and y /? SW . In general, the converse need not hold,
i.e if both x, y ? SW , or both x, y /? SW , then
it may still be that Z(x) > Z(y). This is equiva-
lent to constructing a ranked list of all possible seg-
ments, where the true members of SW appear at the
top, and somewhere down the list the junk, i.e non-
members of SW , start appearing and fill up the rest
of the list. Thus, it is not said where on the list the
true-affixes/junk border begins, just that there is a
consistent such border.
Now, how should this list be computed? Given the
FFA, it?s tempting to look at frequencies alone, i.e
just go through all words and make a list of all seg-
ments, ranking them by frequency? This won?t do it
because 1. it doesn?t compensate between segments
of different length; naturally, short segments will be
more frequent than long ones, solely by virtue of
their shortness 2. it overcounts ill-segmented true
affixes, e.g -ng will invariably get a higher (or equal)
count than -ing. What we will do is a modification
of this strategy, because 1. can easily be amended
by subtracting estimated prior frequencies (under
ACA) and there is a clever way of tackling 2. Note
that, to amend 2., when going through w and each
s/w, it would be nice if we could count s only when
it is well-segmented in w. We are given only W so
this information is not available to us, but, the FFA
assumption let?s us make a local guess of it.
We shall illustrate the idea with an example of an
evolving frequency curve of a word ?playing? and
its segmentations ?playing?, ?aying?, ?ying?, ?ing?,
?ng?, ?g? (W being the set of words from an Eng-
lish bible corpus (Eng, 1977)). Figure 1 shows a

frequency curve fW (s) and its expected frequency
curve eW (s). The expected frequency of a suffix s
doesn?t depend on the actual characters of s and is
defined as:
eW (s) = |W | ?
1
r|s|
Where r is the size of the alphabet under the assump-
tion that its characters are uniformly distributed. We
don?t simply use 26 in the case of lowercase English
since not all characters are equally frequent. Instead
we estimate the size of a would-be uniform distribu-
tion from the entropy of the distribution of the char-
acters in W . This gives r ? 18.98 for English and
other languages with a similar writing practice.
Next, define the adjusted frequency as the differ-
ence between the observed frequency and the ex-
pected frequency:
f ?W (s) = fW (s)? eW (s)
It is the slope of this curve that predicts the presence
of a good split. Figure 2 shows the appearance of
this curve again exemplified by ?playing?.
After these examples, we are ready to define the
segmentation score of a suffix relative to a word Z :
SW ?W ? Q:
ZW (s, w) =
{
0 if not s / w
f ?(si)?f ?(si?1)
|f ?(si?1)|
if s = si(w) for some i
Table 2 shows the evolution of exact values from
the running example.
To move from a Z-score for a segment that is rel-
ative to a word we simply sum over all words to get

To be extra clear, the FFA assumption is ?ex-
ploited? in two ways. On the one hand, frequent
affixes get many oppurtunities to get a score (which
could, however, be negative) in the final sum over
w ? W . On the other hand, the frequency is what
make up the appearance of the slope that predicts the
segmentation point.
The final Z-score in equation 1 is the one that
purports to have the property that Z(x) > Z(y) if
x ? SW and y /? SW ? at least if purged (see be-
low). A summary of the algorithm described in this
section is displayed in table 3.
The time-complexity bounding factor is the num-
ber of suffixes, i.e the cardinality of SW , which is
linear (in the size of the input) if words are bounded
in length by a constant and quadratic in the (really)
worst case if not.

4 Experimental Results
For a regular English 1 million token newspaper
corpus we get the top 30 plus bottom 3 suffixes as
shown in table 4.
English has little affixation compared to e.g Turk-
ish which is at the opposite end of the typological
scale (Dryer, 2005). The corresponding results for
Turkish on a bible corpus (Tur, 1988) is shown in
table 5.
The results largely speak for themselves but some
comments are in order. As is easily seen from the
lists, some suffixes are suffixes of each other so one
could purge the list in some way to get only the
most ?competitive? suffixes. One purging strategy
would be to remove x from the list if there is a z

such that x = yx and Z(z) > Z(x) (this would
remove e.g -ting if -ing is above it on the list). A
more sophisticated purging method is the following,
which does slightly more. First, for a word w ? W
define its best segmentation as: Segment(w) =
argmaxs/wZ(s). Then purge by keeping only those
suffixes which are the best parse for at least one
word: S?W = {s ? SW |?wSegment(w) = s}.
Such purging kicks out the bulk of ?junk? suf-
fixes. Table 4 shows the numbers for English, Turk-
ish and the virtually affixless Maori (Bauer et al,
1993). It should noted that ?junk? suffixes still re-
main after purging ? typically common stem-final
characters ? and that there is no simple relation
between the number of suffixes left after purging
and the amount of morphology of the language in
question. Otherwise we would have expected the
morphology-less Maori to be left with no, or 28-ish,

suffixes or at least less than English.
A good sign is that the purged list and its order
seems to be largely independent of corpus size (as
long as the corpus is not very small) but we do get
some significant differences between bible English
and newspaper English.
We have chosen to illustrate using affixes but the
method readily generalizes to prefixes as well and
even prefixes and suffixes at the same time. As
an example of this, we show top-10 purged prefix-
suffix scores in the same table also for some typo-
logically differing languages in table 7. Again, we
use bible corpora for cross-language comparability
(Swedish (Swe, 1917) and Swahili (Swa, 1953)).
The scores have been normalized in each language
to allow cross-language comparison ? which, judg-
ing from the table, seems meaningful. Swahili is an
exclusively prefixing language but verbs tend to end
in -a (whose status as a morpheme is the linguistic
sense can be doubted), whereas Swedish is suffix-
ing, although some prefixes are or were productive
in word-formation.
A full discussion of further aspects such as a more
informed segmentation of words, peeling of multi-
ple suffix layers and purging of unwanted affixes re-
quires, is beyond the scope of this paper.
5 Related Work
For reasons of space we cannot cite and comment
every relevant paper even in the narrow view of
highly unsupervised extraction of affixes from raw
corpus data, but we will cite enough to cover each
line of research. The vast fields of word segmenta-
tion for speech recognition or for languages which
do not mark word boundaries will not be covered.
In our view, segmentation into lexical units is a dif-
ferent problem than that of affix extraction since the
frequencies of lexical items are different, i.e occur

much more sparsely. Results from this area which
have been carried over or overlap with affic detec-
tion will however be taken into account. A lot of
the papers cited have a wider scope and are still use-
ful even though they are critisized here for having a
non-optimal affix detection component.
Many authors trace their approches back to two
early papers by Zellig Harris (Harris, 1955; Har-
ris, 1970) which count letter successor varieties.
The basic procedure is to ask how many different
phonemes occur (in various utterances e.g a corpus)
after the first n phonemes of some test utterance and
predict that segmentation(s) occur where the number
of succesors reaches a peak. For example, if we have
play, played, playing, player, players, playground
and we wish to test where to segment plays, the suc-
cesor count for the prefix pla would be 1 because
only y occurs after whereas the number of succes-
sors of play peak at three (i.e {e, i, g}). Although
the heuristic has had some success it was shown (in
various interpretations) as early as (Hafer and Weiss,
1974) that it is not really sound ? even for English.
A slightly better method is to compile a set of words
into a trie and predict boundaries at nodes with high
actitivity (e.g (Johnson and Martin, 2003; Schone
and Jurafsky, 2001; Kazakov and Manandhar, 2001)
and earlier papers by the same authors), but this not
sound either as non-morphemic short common char-
acter sequences also show significant branching.
84
The algorithm in this paper is differs significantly
from the Harris-inspired varieties. First, we do
not record the number of phonemes/character of a
given prefix/suffix but the total number of contin-
uations. In the example above, that would be the
set {ed, ing, er, ers, ground} rather than the three-
member set of continuing phonemes/characters.
Secondly, segmentation of a given word is not the
immediate objective and what amounts to identifi-
cation of the end of a lexical (thus generally low-
frequency) item is not within the direct reach of the
model. Thirdly, and most importantly, the algorithm
in this paper looks at the slope of the frequency
curve not at peaks in absolute frequency.
A different approach, sometimes used in com-
plement of other sources of information, is to se-
lect aligned pairs (or sets) of strings that share a
long character sequence (work includes (Jacquemin,
1997; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Baroni et
al., 2002; Clark, 2001)). A notable advantage is that
one is not restricted to concatenative morphology.
Many publications (C?avar et al, 2004; Brent et
al., 1995; Goldsmith et al, 2001; De?jean, 1998;
Snover et al, 2002; Argamon et al, 2004; Gold-
smith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Neuvel and
Fulop, 2002; Baroni, 2003; Gaussier, 1999; Sharma
et al, 2002; Wicentowski, 2002; Oliver, 2004),
and various other works by the same authors, de-
scribe strategies that use frequencies, probabilities,
and optimization criteria, often Minimum Descrip-
tion Length (MDL), in various combinations. So far,
all these are unsatisfactory on two main accounts; on
the theretical side, they still owe an explanation of
why compression or MDL should give birth to seg-
mentations coinciding with morphemes as linguisti-
cally defined. On the experimental side, thresholds,
supervised/developed parametres and selective input
still cloud the success of reported results, which, in
any case, aren?t wide enough to sustain some too
rash language independence claims.
To be more specific, some MDL approaches aim
to minimize the description of the set of words in
the input corpus, some to describe all tokens in
the corpus, but, none aims to minimize, what one
would otherwise expect, the set of possible words
in the language. More importantly, none of the re-
viewed works allow any variation in the descrip-
tion language (?model?) during the minimization
search. Therefore they should be more properly la-
beled ?weighting schemes? and it?s an open question
whether their yields correspond to linguistic analy-
sis. Given an input corpus and a traditional linguis-
tic analysis, it is trivial to show that it is possible to
decrease description length (according to the given
schemes) by stepping away from linguistic analysis.
Moreover, various forms of codebook compression,
such as Lempel-Ziv compression, yield shorter de-
scription but without any known linguistic relevance
at all. What is clear, however, apart from whether it
is theoretically motivated, is that MDL approaches
are useful.
A systematic test of segmentation algorithms over
many different types of languages has yet to be pub-
lished. For three reasons, it will not be undertaken
here either. First, as e.g already Manning (1998)
notes for sandhi phenomena, it is far from clear
what the gold standard should be (even though we
may agree or agree to disagree on some familiar
European languages). Secondly, segmentation al-
gorithms may have different purposes and it might
not make good sense to study segmentation in isola-
tion from induction of paradigms. Lastly, and most
importantly, all of the reviewed techniques (Wicen-
towski, 2004; Wicentowski, 2002; Snover et al,
2002; Baroni et al, 2002; Andreev, 1965; C?avar

Brent et al, 1995), as they are described, have
threshold-parameters of some sort, explicitly claim
not to work well for an open set of languages, or
require noise-free all-form input (Albright, 2002;
Manning, 1998; Borin, 1991). Therefore it is not
possible to even design a fair test.
In any event, we wish to appeal to the merits of
developing a theory in parallel with experimentation
? as opposed to only ad hoc result chasing. If we
have a theory and we don?t get the results we want,
85
wemay scrutinize the assumptions behind the theory
in order to modify or reject it (understanding why
we did so). Without a theory there?s no telling what
to do or how to interpret intermediate numbers in a
long series of calculations.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a new theory of affixation and a
parameter-less efficient algorithm for collecting af-
fixes from raw corpus data of an arbitrary language.
Depending on one?s purposes with it, a cut-off point
for the collected list is still missing, or at least, we
do not consider that matter here. The results are very
promising and competitive but at present we lack
formal evaluation in this respect. Future directions
also include a more specialized look into the relation
between affix-segmentation and paradigmatic varia-
tion and further exploits into layered morphology.
