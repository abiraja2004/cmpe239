Abstract
Community question answering (CQA)
has become an increasingly popular re-
search topic. In this paper, we focus on the
problem of question retrieval. Question
retrieval in CQA can automatically find
the most relevant and recent questions that
have been solved by other users. However,
the word ambiguity and word mismatch
problems bring about new challenges for
question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art
approaches address these issues by implic-
itly expanding the queried questions with
additional words or phrases using mono-
lingual translation models. While use-
ful, the effectiveness of these models is
highly dependent on the availability of
quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g.,
question-answer pairs) in the absence of
which they are troubled by noise issue.
In this work, we propose an alternative
way to address the word ambiguity and
word mismatch problems by taking advan-
tage of potentially rich semantic informa-
tion drawn from other languages. Our pro-
posed method employs statistical machine
translation to improve question retrieval
and enriches the question representation
with the translated words from other lan-
guages via matrix factorization. Experi-
ments conducted on a real CQA data show
that our proposed approach is promising.
1 Introduction
With the development of Web 2.0, community
question answering (CQA) services like Yahoo!
Answers,1 Baidu Zhidao2 and WkiAnswers3 have
attracted great attention from both academia and
industry (Jeon et al, 2005; Xue et al, 2008;
Adamic et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2009; Cao et al,
2010). In CQA, anyone can ask and answer ques-
tions on any topic, and people seeking information
are connected to those who know the answers. As
answers are usually explicitly provided by human,
they can be helpful in answering real world ques-
tions.
In this paper, we focus on the task of question
retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automati-
cally find the most relevant and recent questions
(historical questions) that have been solved by
other users, and then the best answers of these his-
torical questions will be used to answer the users?
queried questions. However, question retrieval is
challenging partly due to the word ambiguity and
word mismatch between the queried questions
and the historical questions in the archives. Word
ambiguity often causes the retrieval models to re-
trieve many historical questions that do not match
the users? intent. This problem is also amplified
by the high diversity of questions and users. For
example, depending on different users, the word
?interest? may refer to ?curiosity?, or ?a charge
for borrowing money?.
Another challenge is word mismatch between
the queried questions and the historical questions.
The queried questions may contain words that are
different from, but related to, the words in the rele-
vant historical questions. For example, if a queried
question contains the word ?company? but a rele-
vant historical question instead contains the word
?firm?, then there is a mismatch and the historical

question may not be easily distinguished from an
irrelevant one.
Researchers have proposed the use of word-
based translation models (Berger et al, 2000;
Jeon et al, 2005; Xue et al, 2008; Lee et al,
2008; Bernhard and Gurevych, 2009) to solve
the word mismatch problem. As a principle ap-
proach to capture semantic word relations, word-
based translation models are built by using the
IBM model 1 (Brown et al, 1993) and have
been shown to outperform traditional models (e.g.,
VSM, BM25, LM) for question retrieval. Be-
sides, Riezler et al (2007) and Zhou et al (2011)
proposed the phrase-based translation models for
question and answer retrieval. The basic idea is
to capture the contextual information in model-
ing the translation of phrases as a whole, thus
the word ambiguity problem is somewhat allevi-
ated. However, all these existing studies in the
literature are basically monolingual approaches
which are restricted to the use of original language
of questions. While useful, the effectiveness of
these models is highly dependent on the availabil-
ity of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g.,
question-answer pairs) in the absence of which
they are troubled by noise issue. In this work,
we propose an alternative way to address the word
ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking
advantage of potentially rich semantic information
drawn from other languages. Through other lan-
guages, various ways of adding semantic informa-
tion to a question could be available, thereby lead-
ing to potentially more improvements than using
the original language only.
Taking a step toward using other languages, we
propose the use of translated representation by al-
ternatively enriching the original questions with
the words from other languages. The idea of im-
proving question retrieval with statistical machine
translation is based on the following two observa-
tions: (1) Contextual information is exploited dur-
ing the translation from one language to another.
For example in Table 1, English words ?interest?
and ?bank? that have multiple meanings under
different contexts are correctly addressed by us-
ing the state-of-the-art translation tool ??Google
Translate.4 Thus, word ambiguity based on con-
textual information is naturally involved when
questions are translated. (2) Multiple words that
have similar meanings in one language may be
translated into an unique word or a few words in a
foreign language. For example in Table 1, English
words such as ?company? and ?firm? are trans-
lated into ??? (g?ngs?)?, ?rheum? and ?catarrh?
are translated into ???(g?nm?o)? in Chinese.
Thus, word mismatch problem can be somewhat
alleviated by using other languages.
Although Zhou et al (2012) exploited bilin-
gual translation for question retrieval and obtained
the better performance than traditional monolin-
gual translation models. However, there are two
problems with this enrichment: (1) enriching
the original questions with the translated words
from other languages increases the dimensionality
and makes the question representation even more
sparse; (2) statistical machine translation may in-
troduce noise, which can harm the performance of
question retrieval. To solve these two problems,
we propose to leverage statistical machine transla-
tion to improve question retrieval via matrix fac-
torization.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the proposed method
by leveraging statistical machine translation to im-
prove question retrieval via matrix factorization.
Section 3 presents the experimental results. In sec-
tion 4, we conclude with ideas for future research.

2 Our Approach
2.1 Problem Statement
This paper aims to leverage statistical machine
translation to enrich the question representation.
In order to address the word ambiguity and word
mismatch problems, we expand a question by
adding its translation counterparts. Statistical ma-
chine translation (e.g., Google Translate) can uti-
lize contextual information during the question
translation, so it can solve the word ambiguity and
word mismatch problems to some extent.
Let L = {l1, l2, . . . , lP } denote the language
set, where P is the number of languages con-
sidered in the paper, l1 denotes the original lan-
guage (e.g., English) while l2 to lP are the for-
eign languages. Let D1 = {d(1)1 , d(1)2 , . . . , d(1)N }
be the set of historical question collection in origi-
nal language, where N is the number of historical
questions in D1 with vocabulary size M1. Now
we first translate each original historical question
from language l1 into other languages lp (p ?
[2, P ]) by Google Translate. Thus, we can ob-
tain D2, . . . , DP in different languages, and Mp is
the vocabulary size of Dp. A question d(p)i in Dp
is simply represented as a Mp dimensional vector
d(p)i , in which each entry is calculated by tf-idf.
The N historical questions in Dp are then repre-
sented in a Mp ? N term-question matrix Dp =
{d(p)1 ,d
(p)
2 , . . . ,d
(p)
N }, in which each row corre-
sponds to a term and each column corresponds to
a question.
Intuitively, we can enrich the original ques-
tion representation by adding the translated words
from language l2 to lP , the original vocabu-
lary size is increased from M1 to ?Pp=1 Mp.
Thus, the term-question matrix becomes D =
{D1,D2, . . . ,DP } and D ? R(
?P
p=1 Mp)?N .
However, there are two problems with this enrich-
ment: (1) enriching the original questions with the
translated words from other languages makes the
question representation even more sparse; (2) sta-
tistical machine translation may introduce noise.5
To solve these two problems, we propose to
leverage statistical machine translation to improve
question retrieval via matrix factorization. Figure
1 presents the framework of our proposed method,
where qi represents a queried question, and qi is a
vector representation of qi.
5Statistical machine translation quality is far from satis-
factory in real applications.

2.2 Model Formulation
To tackle the data sparseness of question represen-
tation with the translated words, we hope to find
two or more lower dimensional matrices whose
product provides a good approximate to the orig-
inal one via matrix factorization. Previous stud-
ies have shown that there is psychological and
physiological evidence for parts-based representa-
tion in the human brain (Wachsmuth et al, 1994).
The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is
proposed to learn the parts of objects like text
documents (Lee and Seung, 2001). NMF aims
to find two non-negative matrices whose product
provides a good approximation to the original ma-
trix and has been shown to be superior to SVD in
document clustering (Xu et al, 2003; Tang et al,
2012).
In this paper, NMF is used to induce the reduced
representation Vp of Dp, Dp is independent on
{D1,D2, . . . ,Dp?1,Dp+1, . . . ,DP }. When ig-
noring the coupling between Vp, it can be solved
by minimizing the objective function as follows:
O1(Up,Vp) = minUp?0,Vp?0 ?Dp ?UpVp?
2
F (1)
where ? ? ?F denotes Frobenius norm of a matrix.
Matrices Up ? RMp?K and Vp ? RK?N are the
reduced representation for terms and questions in
the K dimensional space, respectively.
To reduce the noise introduced by statistical ma-
chine translation, we assume that Vp from lan-
guage Dp (p ? [2, P ]) should be close to V1
854
from the original language D1. Based on this as-
sumption, we minimize the distance between Vp
(p ? [2, P ]) and V1 as follows:
O2(Vp) = minVp?0
P?
p=2
?Vp ?V1?2F (2)
Combining equations (1) and (2), we get the fol-
lowing objective function:
O(U1, . . . ,UP ;V1, . . . ,VP ) (3)
=
P?
p=1
?Dp ?UpVp?2F +
P?
p=2
?p?Vp ?V1?2F
where parameter ?p (p ? [2, P ]) is used to adjust
the relative importance of these two components.
If we set a small value for ?p, the objective func-
tion behaves like the traditional NMF and the im-
portance of data sparseness is emphasized; while a
big value of ?p indicatesVp should be very closed
to V1, and equation (3) aims to remove the noise
introduced by statistical machine translation.
By solving the optimization problem in equa-
tion (4), we can get the reduced representation of
terms and questions.
minO(U1, . . . ,UP ;V1, . . . ,VP ) (4)
subject to : Up ? 0,Vp ? 0, p ? [1, P ]
2.3 Optimization
The objective function O defined in equation (4)
performs data sparseness and noise removing si-
multaneously. There are 2P coupling components
in O, and O is not convex in both U and V to-
gether. Therefore it is unrealistic to expect an al-
gorithm to find the global minima. In the follow-
ing, we introduce an iterative algorithm which can
achieve local minima. In our optimization frame-
work, we optimize the objective function in equa-
tion (4) by alternatively minimizing each compo-
nent when the remaining 2P ? 1 components are
fixed. This procedure is summarized in Algorithm
1.
2.3.1 Update of MatrixUp
Holding V1, . . . ,VP and U1, . . . ,Up?1,Up+1,
. . . ,UP fixed, the update of Up amounts to the
following optimization problem:
min
Up?0
?Dp ?UpVp?2F (5)
Algorithm 1 Optimization framework
Input: Dp ? Rmp?N , p ? [1, P ]
1: for p = 1 : P do
2: V(0)p ? RK?N ? random matrix
3: for t = 1 : T do  T is iteration times
4: U(t)p ? UpdateU(Dp,V(t?1)p )
5: V(t)p ? UpdateV(Dp,U(t)p )
6: end for
7: returnU(T )p , V(T )p
8: end for
Algorithm 2 Update Up
Input: Dp ? RMp?N , Vp ? RK?N
1: for i = 1 : Mp do
2: u?(p)?i = (VpVTp )?1Vpd?(p)i
3: end for
4: returnUp
Let d?(p)i = (d(p)i1 , . . . , d(p)iK )T and u?(p)i =
(u(p)i1 , . . . , u
(p)
iK )T be the column vectors whose en-
tries are those of the ith row of Dp and Up re-
spectively. Thus, the optimization of equation (5)
can be decomposed into Mp optimization prob-
lems that can be solved independently, with each
corresponding to one row of Up:
min
u?(p)i ?0
?d?(p)i ?VTp u?
(p)
i ?22 (6)
for i = 1, . . . ,Mp.
Equation (6) is a standard least squares prob-
lems in statistics and the solution is:
u?(p)?i = (VpVTp )?1Vpd?
(p)
i (7)
Algorithm 2 shows the procedure.
2.3.2 Update of MatrixVp
Holding U1, . . . ,UP and V1, . . . ,Vp?1,Vp+1,
. . . ,VP fixed, the update of Vp amounts to the
optimization problem divided into two categories.
if p ? [2, P ], the objective function can be writ-
ten as:
min
Vp?0
?Dp ?UpVp?2F + ?p?Vp ?V1?2F (8)
if p = 1, the objective function can be written
as:
min
Vp?0
?Dp ?UpVp?2F + ?p?Vp?2F (9)
855
Let d(p)j be the jth column vector of Dp, and
v(p)j be the jth column vector of Vp, respectively.
Thus, equation (8) can be rewritten as:
min
{v(p)j ?0}
N?
j=1
?d(p)j ?Upv
(p)
j ?22+
N?
j=1
?p?v(p)j ?v
(1)
j ?22
(10)
which can be decomposed into N optimization
problems that can be solved independently, with
each corresponding to one column of Vp:
min
v(p)j ?0
?d(p)j ?Upv
(p)
j ?22+?p?v
(p)
j ?v
(1)
j ?22 (11)
for j = 1, . . . , N .
Equation (12) is a least square problem with L2
norm regularization. Now we rewrite the objective
function in equation (12) as
L(v(p)j ) = ?d
(p)
j ?Upv
(p)
j ?22 + ?p?v
p
j ? v
(1)
j ?22
(12)
where L(v(1)j ) is convex, and hence has a unique
solution. Taking derivatives, we obtain:
?L(v(p)j )
?v(p)j
= ?2UTp (d(p)j ?Upv
(p)
j )+2?p(v
(p)
j ?v
(1)
j )
(13)
Forcing the partial derivative to be zero leads to
v(p)?j = (UTpUp + ?pI)?1(UTp d
(p)
j + ?pv
(1)
j )
(14)
where p ? [2, P ] denotes the foreign language rep-
resentation.
Similarly, the solution of equation (9) is:
v(p)?j = (UTpUp + ?pI)?1UTp d
(p)
j (15)
where p = 1 denotes the original language repre-
sentation.
Algorithm 3 shows the procedure.
2.4 Time Complexity Analysis
In this subsection, we discuss the time complex-
ity of our proposed method. The optimization
u?(p)i using Algorithm 2 should calculate VpVTp
and Vpd?(p)i , which takes O(NK2 + NK) op-
erations. Therefore, the optimization Up takes
O(NK2 + MpNK) operations. Similarly, the
time complexity of optimization Vi using Algo-
rithm 3 is O(MpK2 + MpNK).
Another time complexity is the iteration times
T used in Algorithm 1 and the total number of

languages P , the overall time complexity of our
proposed method is:
P?
p=1
T ?O(NK2 + MpK2 + 2MpNK) (16)
For each language Dp, the size of vocabulary
Mp is almost constant as the number of questions
increases. Besides, K ? min(Mp, N), theoreti-
cally, the computational time is almost linear with
the number of questions N and the number of lan-
guages P considered in the paper. Thus, the pro-
posed method can be easily adapted to the large-
scale information retrieval task.
2.5 Relevance Ranking
The advantage of incorporating statistical machine
translation in relevance ranking is to reduce ?word
ambiguity? and ?word mismatch? problems. To
do so, given a queried question q and a historical
question d from Yahoo! Answers, we first trans-
late q and d into other foreign languages (e.g., Chi-
nese, French etc.) and get the corresponding trans-
lated representation qi and di (i ? [2, P ]), where
P is the number of languages considered in the pa-
per. For queried question q = q1, we represent it
in the reduced space:
vq1 = argminv?0 ?q1 ?U1v?
2
2 + ?1?v?22 (17)
where vector q1 is the tf-idf representation of
queried question q1 in the term space. Similarly,
for historical question d = d1 (and its tf-idf repre-
sentation d1 in the term space) we represent it in
the reduced space as vd1 .
856
The relevance score between the queried ques-
tion q1 and the historical question d1 in the re-
duced space is, then, calculated as the cosine sim-
ilarity between vq1 and vd1 :
s(q1, d1) =
< vq1 ,vd1 >
?vq1?2 ? ?vd1?2
(18)
For translated representation qi (i ? [2, P ]), we
also represent it in the reduced space:
vqi = argminv?0 ?qi?Uiv?
2
2+?i?v?vq1?22 (19)
where vector qi is the tf-idf representation of qi
in the term space. Similarly, for translated rep-
resentation di (and its tf-idf representation di in
the term space) we also represent it in the reduced
space as vdi . The relevance score s(qi, di) be-
tween qi and di in the reduced space can be cal-
culated as the cosine similarity between vqi and
vdi .
Finally, we consider learning a relevance func-
tion of the following general, linear form:
Score(q, d) = ?T ??(q, d) (20)
where feature vector ?(q, d) =
(sV SM (q, d), s(q1, d1), s(q2, d2), . . . , s(qP , dP )),
and ? is the corresponding weight vector, we
optimize this parameter for our evaluation metrics
directly using the Powell Search algorithm (Paul
et al, 1992) via cross-validation. sV SM (q, d) is
the relevance score in the term space and can be
calculated using Vector Space Model (VSM).
3 Experiments
3.1 Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
We collect the data set from Yahoo! Answers and
use the getByCategory function provided in Ya-
hoo! Answers API6 to obtain CQA threads from
the Yahoo! site. More specifically, we utilize
the resolved questions and the resulting question
repository that we use for question retrieval con-
tains 2,288,607 questions. Each resolved ques-
tion consists of four parts: ?question title?, ?ques-
tion description?, ?question answers? and ?ques-
tion category?. For question retrieval, we only use
the ?question title? part. It is assumed that ques-
tion title already provides enough semantic infor-
mation for understanding the users? information
needs (Duan et al, 2008). There are 26 categories

at the first level and 1,262 categories at the leaf
level. Each question belongs to a unique leaf cat-
egory. Table 2 shows the distribution across first-
level categories of the questions in the archives.
We use the same test set in previous work (Cao
et al, 2009; Cao et al, 2010). This set contains
252 queried questions and can be freely down-
loaded for research communities.7
The original language of the above data set is
English (l1) and then they are translated into four
other languages (Chinese (l2), French (l3), Ger-
man (l4), Italian (l5)), thus the number of language
considered is P = 5) by using the state-of-the-art
translation tool ??Google Translate.
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluate the perfor-
mance of question retrieval using the following
metrics: Mean Average Precision (MAP) and
Precision@N (P@N). MAP rewards methods that
return relevant questions early and also rewards
correct ranking of the results. P@N reports the
fraction of the top-N questions retrieved that are
relevant. We perform a significant test, i.e., a t-
test with a default significant level of 0.05.
We tune the parameters on a small development
set of 50 questions. This development set is also
extracted from Yahoo! Answers, and it is not in-
cluded in the test set. For parameter K, we do an
experiment on the development set to determine
the optimal values among 50, 100, 150, ? ? ? , 300 in
terms of MAP. Finally, we set K = 100 in the ex-
periments empirically as this setting yields the best
performance. For parameter ?1, we set ?1 = 1
empirically, while for parameter ?i (i ? [2, P ]),
we set ?i = 0.25 empirically and ensure that?
i ?i = 1.

3.2 Question Retrieval Results
Table 3 presents the main retrieval performance.
Row 1 and row 2 are two baseline systems, which
model the relevance score using VSM (Cao et al,
2010) and language model (LM) (Zhai and Laf-
ferty, 2001; Cao et al, 2010) in the term space.
Row 3 and row 6 are monolingual translation mod-
els to address the word mismatch problem and
obtain the state-of-the-art performance in previ-
ous work. Row 3 is the word-based translation
model (Jeon et al, 2005), and row 4 is the word-
based translation language model, which linearly
combines the word-based translation model and
language model into a unified framework (Xue et
al., 2008). Row 5 is the phrase-based translation
model, which translates a sequence of words as
whole (Zhou et al, 2011). Row 6 is the entity-
based translation model, which extends the word-
based translation model and explores strategies to
learn the translation probabilities between words
and the concepts using the CQA archives and a
popular entity catalog (Singh, 2012). Row 7 is
the bilingual translation model, which translates
the English questions from Yahoo! Answers into
Chinese questions using Google Translate and ex-
pands the English words with the translated Chi-
nese words (Zhou et al, 2012). For these previ-
ous work, we use the same parameter settings in
the original papers. Row 8 and row 9 are our pro-
posed method, which leverages statistical machine
translation to improve question retrieval via ma-
trix factorization. In row 8, we only consider two
languages (English and Chinese) and translate En-
glish questions into Chinese using Google Trans-
late in order to compare with Zhou et al (2012).
In row 9, we translate English questions into other
four languages. There are some clear trends in the
result of Table 3:
(1) Monolingual translation models signifi-
cantly outperform the VSM and LM (row 1 and
row 2 vs. row 3, row 4, row 5 and row 6).
(2) Taking advantage of potentially rich seman-
tic information drawn from other languages via
statistical machine translation, question retrieval
performance can be significantly improved (row 3,
row 4, row 5 and row 6 vs. row 7, row 8 and row 9,
all these comparisons are statistically significant at
p < 0.05).
(3) Our proposed method (leveraging statisti-
cal machine translation via matrix factorization,
SMT + MF) significantly outperforms the bilin-
gual translation model of Zhou et al (2012) (row
7 vs. row 8, the comparison is statistically signifi-
cant at p < 0.05). The reason is that matrix factor-
ization used in the paper can effectively solve the
data sparseness and noise introduced by the ma-
chine translator simultaneously.
(4) When considering more languages, ques-
tion retrieval performance can be further improved
(row 8 vs. row 9).
Note that Wang et al (2009) also addressed the
word mismatch problem for question retrieval by
using syntactic tree matching. We do not compare
with Wang et al (2009) in Table 3 because pre-
vious work (Ming et al, 2010) demonstrated that
word-based translation language model (Xue et
al., 2008) obtained the superior performance than
the syntactic tree matching (Wang et al, 2009).
Besides, some other studies attempt to improve
question retrieval with category information (Cao
et al, 2009; Cao et al, 2010), label ranking (Li et
al., 2011) or world knowledge (Zhou et al, 2012).
However, their methods are orthogonal to ours,
and we suspect that combining the category infor-
mation or label ranking into our proposed method
might get even better performance. We leave it for
future research.
3.3 Impact of the Matrix Factorization
Our proposed method (SMT +MF) can effectively
solve the data sparseness and noise via matrix fac-
torization. To further investigate the impact of
the matrix factorization, one intuitive way is to
expand the original questions with the translated
words from other four languages, without consid-
ering the data sparseness and noise introduced by
machine translator. We compare our SMT + MF
with this intuitive enriching method (SMT + IEM).
Besides, we also employ our proposed matrix fac-
torization to the original question representation
(VSM + MF). Table 4 shows the comparison.

2 VSM + MF 0.411 0.253

4 SMT + MF (P = 5) 0.564 0.291
Table 4: The impact of matrix factorization.
(1) Our proposed matrix factorization can sig-
nificantly improve the performance of question re-
trieval (row 1 vs. row2; row3 vs. row4, the
improvements are statistically significant at p <
0.05). The results indicate that our proposed ma-
trix factorization can effectively address the issues
of data spareness and noise introduced by statisti-
cal machine translation.
(2) Compared to the relative improvements of
row 3 and row 4, the relative improvements of row
1 and row 2 is much larger. The reason may be
that although matrix factorization can be used to
reduce dimension, it may impair the meaningful
terms.
(3) Compared to VSM, the performance of
SMT + IEM is significantly improved (row 1
vs. row 3), which supports the motivation that
the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems
could be partially addressed by Google Translate.
3.4 Impact of the Translation Language
One of the success of this paper is to take ad-
vantage of potentially rich semantic information
drawn from other languages to solve the word am-
biguity and word mismatch problems. So we con-
struct a dummy translator (DT) that translates an
English word to itself. Thus, through this trans-
lation, we do not add any semantic information
into the original questions. The comparison is pre-
sented in Table 5. Row 1 (DT + MF) represents
integrating two copies of English questions with
our proposed matrix factorization. From Table 5,
we have several different findings:
(1) Taking advantage of potentially rich seman-
tic information drawn from other languages can
significantly improve the performance of question
retrieval (row 1 vs. row 2, row 3, row 4 and row 5,
the improvements relative to DT + MF are statisti-
cally significant at p < 0.05).
(2) Different languages contribute unevenly for
question retrieval (e.g., row 2 vs. row 3). The
reason may be that the improvements of leverag-
ing different other languages depend on the qual-
ity of machine translation. For example, row 3

8 SMT + MF (P = 5, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5) 0.564

is better than row 2 because the translation qual-
ity of English-French is much better than English-
Chinese.
(3) Using much more languages does not seem
to produce significantly better performance (row 6
and row 7 vs. row 8). The reason may be that in-
consistency between different languages may exist
due to statistical machine translation.
3.5 Impact of the Contextual Information
In this paper, we translate the English questions
into other four languages using Google Translate
(GTrans), which takes into account contextual in-
formation during translation. If we translate a
question word by word, it discards the contextual
information. We would expect that such a transla-
tion would not be able to solve the word ambiguity
problem.
To investigate the impact of contextual infor-
mation for question retrieval, we only consider
two languages and translate English questions
into Chinese using an English to Chinese lexicon
(Dict) in StarDict8. Table 6 shows the experi-
mental results, we can see that the performance is
degraded when the contextual information is not
considered for the translation of questions. The
reason is that GTrans is context-dependent and
thus produces different translated Chinese words
depending on the context of an English word.
Therefore, the word ambiguity problem can be
solved during the English-Chinese translation.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we propose to employ statistical ma-
chine translation to improve question retrieval and

enrich the question representation with the trans-
lated words from other languages via matrix fac-
torization. Experiments conducted on a real CQA
data show some promising findings: (1) the pro-
posed method significantly outperforms the pre-
vious work for question retrieval; (2) the pro-
posed matrix factorization can significantly im-
prove the performance of question retrieval, no
matter whether considering the translation lan-
guages or not; (3) considering more languages can
further improve the performance but it does not
seem to produce significantly better performance;
(4) different languages contribute unevenly for
question retrieval; (5) our proposed method can
be easily adapted to the large-scale information re-
trieval task.
As future work, we plan to incorporate the ques-
tion structure (e.g., question topic and question fo-
cus (Duan et al, 2008)) into the question represen-
tation for question retrieval. We also want to fur-
ther investigate the use of the proposed method for
other kinds of data set, such as categorized ques-
tions from forum sites and FAQ sites.
