SUMMARY 
In information retrieval the task is to extract from the 
database ~dl ,and only the documents which are relevant to 
a user query, even when the query and the documents use 
little common vocabul~u'y. In this paper we discuss the 
problem of automatic generation of lexical relations 
between words ,and phrltses from large text corpora :rod 
their application to automatic query expansion ill informa- 
tion retrieval. Reported here ,are some preliminary resuhs 
and observations from the experiments with a 85 million 
word Wall Street Journal dalabase and a 45 million word 
San Jose Mercury News database (piu'ts of 0.5 billion 
word TIPSTER/TREC datab`ase). 
INTRODUCTION 
Tile task of information retrieval is to extract 
relevant documents from large collection of documents ill 
response to a user's query. When the documents cont:dn 
primm'ily unrestricted text (e.g., newspaper `articles, legld 
documents, etc.) the relev,'mce of a document is esta- 
blished through 'full-text' retriewd. This has been usually 
accomplished by identifying key terms in the documents 
(the process known as 'indexing') which could then be 
matched against erms in queries (Salton, 1989). The 
effectiveness of ,any such term-b`ased approach is directly 
related to the accuracy with which a set of terms 
represents he content of a document, ,as well as how well 
it contrasts a given document with respect o other docu- 
ments. In other words, we ,are looking for a represeutat ion 
R such that for any text items D1 and D2, R(DI) = R(D2) 
iff meaning(D1) = meaning(D2), at an appropriate l vel 
of abstraction (which may depend on types and character 
of anticipated queries). 
For all kinds of terms that can be assigned 1o the 
representation of a docmnent, e.g., words, operator- 
m'gument pairs, fixed phrases, ~md proper n,'unes, vltrious 
levels of "reguh'u'ization" ,are needed to ,assure that syn- 
tactic or lexie,'d v,'u'iations of input do not obscure under- 
lying semantic uniformity. Without actually doing 
semantic analysis, tiffs kind of normalization can be 
achieved through the following processes: ~ 
(1) morpbological stemming: e.g., retrieving is 
reduced to retriev; 
An altematlve, but less efficient method is to generate all vari- 
ants (lexical, syntactic, etc.) of words/phrases in the queries (Sparck- 
Jones & "Fail, 1984). 
(2) lexicon-based word nonnldizntion: e.g., retrieval 
is reduced to retrieve; 
(3) operator-argument representation f phr'tses: e.g., 
information retrieval, retrievhlg of information, 
and retrieve relewmt information ,are ,all assigned 
the slune representation, retrieve+btformation; 
(4) conlext-blmed term clustering into synonymy 
classes and subsumption hierarchies: e.g., take- 
over is a kind of acquisition (in business), luld 
Fortran is a programming language. 
We have established the general architecture ofa NLP-IR 
system that accommodates these considerations. In a gen- 
eral view of this design, depicted schematic~dly below, an 
advanced NLP module is inserted between the textuld 
input (new documeuts, user queries) and the datab~Jse 
search engine (in our c`ase, NIST's PRISE system). 
NLP: ' FA \ [~ PARSER temls 
This design has already shown some promise in produc- 
ing signific~mtly better performance than the base statisti- 
cld system (Strz~dkowski, 1993). Its practical significance 
stems in no slnall part from the use of a tkst and robust 
parser, TI'P, 2 which can process unrestricted text at 
speeds below 0.2 sec per sentence. TI'P's output is It reg- 
ularized representation 1' each sentence which reflects 
logical prcdicalc-argumclll su'uclure, e.g., Iogic:d subject 
and logical objects are identilicd depending upon the 
main verb subcategorization frame. For example, Ihe verb 
abide has, among others, a subcategorization frame in 
which the object is a prepositional pbrase with by, i.e., 
ABIDE: subject NP object PREP by NP 
Subcategorization inlbrmution is rend from the on-line 
Oxford Advanced Le`arner's Diction,try (OALD) which 
TTP uses. 
TFP stands for Tagged Text Parser, and it has I:een described in 
detail in (Strzalkowski, 1992) and ev~duated in (Strzalkowski & 
Scheyen, 1993).

ltEAD-MODIFIER STRUCTURES 
TTP p,'u'se structures are p~tssed to the phrase 
extraction module where head+modifier (including 
predicate+,'u'gument) pairs are extracted and collected into 
occurrence patterns. The following types of 
head+modifier pairs m'e extracted: 
(1) a head noun and its left adjective or noun adjunct, 
(2) a head noun ,and the head of its right adjunct, 
(3) the m,'fin verb of a clanse and the head of its 
object pbrase. 
These types of p,'firs account for most of the syntactic 
vm'i~mts for relating two words (or simple phrases) into 
pairs c,'urying compatible semantic ontent. For example, 
the pair retrieve+information will be extracted from mty 
of the following fragments: information retrieval system; 
retrieval of it~rmation /)'om databases; and information 
that can be retrieved by a user-controlled interactive 
search process. 3
Figure 1 shows TTP parse and head+modifier pairs 
extracted. Whenever multiple-noun strings (two nouns 
plus another noun or adjective) are present, they need Io 
be structurally disambiguated before any pairs emt be 
extracted. This is accomplished using statistically-based 
preferences, e.g., world+third is pt'etizn'ed to either 
country+world or cot#ltry+third when extracted from 
third world country. If such preferences cannot be cont- 
puted, all alternatives ,'u'e discarded to avokl noisy input 
to clustering progrmns.

TERM CORRELATIONS FROM TEXT 
Head-modifier pairs serve as occurrence contexts 
for terms included in them: both single words (as shown 
in Fignre 1) and other pairs (in case of nested pairs, e.g., 
cottntry+\[world+third\]). If two terms tend to be modilicd 
with a number of common modifiers but otherwise appear 
in few distinct contexts, we assign them a simih'uity 
coefficient, a real number between 0 and 1. The similarity 
is determined by comparing distribution characlerislics 
for both terms within the corpus: in general we will credit 
high-content terms appem'ing in multiple identical elm- 
texts, provided that these contexts are not too common- 
place. 4 Figure 2 shows exmnples of terms sharing a 
number of common contexts along with frequencies of 
occurrence in a 250 MByte subset of Wall Street Journal 
database. A head context is when two distinct modifiers 
,are attached to the same head element; a rood context is 
when the s,'une term modilles two distinct heads. 
To compute term similarities we used a variant of 
weighted Jacc\[u'd's measure described in e.g., (Grefen-

In another series of exf, orinmt~ts (Swzalkowskl & Vauthey, 
1992} we used a Mtllnal lnfo0maliou I}ased classillcalion formula (e.g., 
Church and ttanks, 1990; lliudle, 1990), but we l~,}und it less effeclive 
for diverse dalabases, uch as WSJ.

In rite above, f~,y stands for absolute fi'equency of pair 
\[x,y\] in tile corpus, ny is the frequency of term y, and N is 
ttte number of single-word terms. 
hi order to generate better sitnilarities, we require 
that words xt and x2 appear in at least M distinct conl- 
ilion contexts, where It common context is a couple of 
pairs \[xt,Y\] and \[x2,y\], or \[y,x 1\] and \[y,r 2\] such that they 
each occun'ed at legist K times. Thus, banana and Baltic 
will not be considered for similm-ity relation on the basis 
of tlteir occurrences in the common context of republic, 
no matter how frequent, unless there are M-1 other such 
common contexts comparably frequent (there wasn't any 
in TREC's WSJ database). For smaller or narrow domain 
databases M=2 is usually sufficient, e.g., CACM d:ltab:t,~e 
of computer science abstracts. For large databases cover- 
ing a diverse subject matter, like WSJ or SJMN (S,'m Jose 
Mercury News), we used M>_5. 6 This, however, turned 
out not to be sufficient. We would still genemle faMy 
strong simih'u'ity links between terms such as aerospace 
mid pharmaceutical where 6 and more comlnon contexts 
were found, even after a number of comlnon contexts, 
such ,'is company or market, have already been rejected 
because they were paired with too msmy different words, 
and thus had a dispersion ratio too high. The remaining 
common contexts m'e listed in Figure 3, ~dong with their 
GEW scores, all occurring at the head (left) position of a 
pair.

6 For example &tnana mM Dominican were found to have two 
common contexts: republic and plant, although tiffs second occurred in 
apparently different senses in Dominican plant and banatla ptattt. 
When analyzing Figure 3, we should note that 
while some of the GEW weights are quite low (GEW 
takes values between 0 and 1), thus indicating a low 
ilnportance context, the frequencies with which these con- 
texts occurred wilh both ter,ns were high and balanced on 
both sides (e.g., concern), thus adding to tile slrength of 
association. To liher out such casts we established thres- 
holds for adlnissible values of GEW factor, and disre- 
Du'ded contexts with entropy weights falling below the 
threshold. In the most recent experiments with WSJ texts, 
we found that 0.6 is a good threshold. We also observed 
that clustering bead terms using their moditiers as con- 
texts converges faster and gives generally ntore reliable 
links thai\] when rood terms are clustered using heads as 
context (e.g., in the above example). In onr experiment 
with tile WSJ database, we fotmd that an occurrence of  a 
common head context needs to be considered Its eoulri- 
bttting less to the total context cotint than an occurrence 
of a common rood context: we used 0.6 and l, respec- 
tively. Using this formtda, terms man and boy in Figure 2 
share 5.4 contexts (4 head contexts and 3 rood contexts). 
hlilially, term similmities are organized into clus- 
ters around a centmid term. Figure 4 shows top 10 ele- 
ments (sorted by similarity wflue) of tile chister for 
president. Note that in this case lhe SIM value drops sud- 
denly after the second element of the cluster. Changes in 
SIM vahle are nsed to deternline cut-off points for clus- 
ters. Tile role of GTS factor will be explgfined later. Sam- 
ple clusters obtained fi'om approx. 250 MByte (42 million 
words) snbset of WSJ (years 1990-1992) are given in 
Table 1. 
It may be worth pointing out that the similarities arc 
calculated ilsing term co-occurrences in syntaclic rather 
than in document-size contexts, the latter Ix:ing the usual 
practice it1 non-linguistic hlstering (e.g., Sparck Jones 
and Batlx:r, 1971; Crouch, 1988; Lewis and Croft, 1990). 
Although the two methods of te,'m clustering inay be COll- 
sidered mntttally complementary in certaitt situations, we 
believe that more and slrouger associations can be 
obtained tllrough syntactic-context chlstering, given 
suflicient alnonnt of data and a reasonably accnralc syu-

containing term w t with weight ~*to, 8 where co is the 
weight w2 would have if it were present in the query. 
Simil,'u'ly, if GTS(w2) <~2 * GTS(wL) ,'rod 
SIM,,orm(wl,w2) =~ > 0:~ (with 82 < 8t ,and 0t < 02) then 
we may consider w~ as synonymous to w~. All other ela- 
tions ,are discarded. For example, the following were 
obtained from the WSJ training database: 
GTS(takeover) =0.00145576 
GTS(merge) = 0.00094518 
GTS (buy-out) = 0.00272580 
GTS(acquire) = 0.00057906 
with 
SIM (takeover,merge) = 0.190444 
SIM (takeover,buy-out) =0.157410 
SIM (takeover,acquire) = 0.139497 
SIM (merge,buy-out) = 0.133800 
SIM (merge,acquire) = 0.263772 
SIM(buy-out,acquire) = 0.109106 
Therefore both takeover and buy-out can be used to spe- 
cialize merge or acquire. With this filter, the relationships 
between takeover ~md buy-out and between merge ~md 
acquire ,are either both discarded or accepted as 
synonymous. At this time we are unable to tell 
synonymous or ne,'u" synonymous relationships from those 
which ,are prim,wily complement~u-y, e.g., matt ,and 
womatt. 
Filtered simih'u'ity relations create a domain map of 
terms. At present it may cont~fin only two types of links: 
equiv,'dence (synonymy and near-synonymy) ,and sub- 
sumption (specification). Figure 5 shows a small frag- 
ment of such map derived from lexic,-d relation computed 
from WSJ datab`ase. The domain map is used to expand 
user queries with related terms, either automatically or in 
a feedback mode by showing the user appropriate p~u'ts of 
the map.

We should add that the query exp~msion (in the 
sense considered here, Ibough not quite in the stone way) 
has been used in information retrieval research befo*'e 
(e.g., Sp,'trck Jones and Tail, 1984; Harm\[m, 1988), usu- 
aUy with mixed results. The main difference between the 
current approach ,'u~d those previous attempts is that we 
use lexico-sernantic evidence for selecting extra terms, 
while they relied on term co-occurrence within the same 
documents. In fact we consider these to methods colnple- 
mentary with the latter being more appropriate for 
automatic relevance feedback. An alternative query 
expansion to is to use term clusters to create new terms, 
"metaterms", and use them to index the database instead 
(e.g., Crouch, 1988; Lewis ,and Croft, 1990). We found 
that the query exp~sion approach gives the system more 
flexibility, for inst,'mce, by making room lbr hypertext- 
style topic exploration via user feedback. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We discussed selected aspecLq our inlormation 
retrieved system consisting of an advanced NLP module 
and a 'st~mdard' statistical core engine, ht this paper we 
concentrated on the problem of automatic generation of 
lexical correlations among terms which (aloug with 
appropriate weighting scheme) represent the content of 
both the dat:d)ase documents :rod the user queries. Since it 
successful retrieval relies on actual term matches between 
the queries ,'u~d the documents, it is essential t mt any lexi- 
cal alternatives of describing a given topic ,are taken into 
account. In our system this is achieved through the expan- 
sion of user's queries with related terms: we add 
equiwdent ,and more specific terms. Lexical relations 
between terms are c;dculated irectly from the database 
and stored in tbe form of a dom~dn map, which thus acts 
as a domaln-specilic thesaurus. Query expansion can be 
done in the user-feedback mode (with user's assistance) 
or automatically. In this latter c~se, local context is 
explored to ,assure meaningful exp~msious, i.e., to prevent 
e.g., exp,'mding 'charge' with 'expense' when 'allege' or 
'blame' is meant, as in the following ex~unple query: 
Documents will report on corruption, incompetence, 
on' inefficiency in the m.magement of the United 
N.'~litm's st'dT. Alleg~dions t~l' lnIil|agelnelll railings, 
as well as Felofls Io StlCh charges ~u'e relevanl. 
Many problems remain, however, we attempted 1o 
demonstrate that the architecture described here is 
nonetbeless viable and h`as practiced significance. More 
advanced NLP techniques (including semantic ,'m~dysis) 
may prove to be still more effective, in the future, how- 
ever their enormous cost limits ~my experimental evi- 
dence to small scale tests (e.g., Mauldin, 1991).

APPI~,NI)IX: An examlfle query 
The li)llowiug is an example infommtion requesl 
(based on TREC's lOl)ic 113) and file resulliug query. 
Except for its inverled document frequency score, each 
lerm has a "conlidence level" weight which is set Io 1.0 if 
Ihe term is fouad in the nser's query, and is less lhau 1.0 
if the term is added Ihrough an expansion fl'om 1he 
domain map. Only non-negaled terms wilh idf of 6.0 or
