Abstract 
In this paper we use the Reeks Nederlandse 
Dialectatlassen as a source for the recon-
struction of a ?proto-language? of Dutch 
dialects. We used 360 dialects from loca-
tions in the Netherlands, the northern part 
of Belgium and French-Flanders. The den-
sity of dialect locations is about the same 
everywhere. For each dialect we recon-
structed 85 words. For the reconstruction of 
vowels we used knowledge of Dutch his-
tory, and for the reconstruction of conso-
nants we used well-known tendencies 
found in most textbooks about historical 
linguistics. We validated results by com-
paring the reconstructed forms with pro-
nunciations according to a proto-Germanic 
dictionary (K?bler, 2003). For 46% of the 
words we reconstructed the same vowel or 
the closest possible vowel when the vowel 
to be reconstructed was not found in the 
dialect material. For 52% of the words all 
consonants we reconstructed  were the 
same. For 42% of the words, only one con-
sonant was differently reconstructed. We 
measured the divergence of Dutch dialects 
from their ?proto-language?. We measured 
pronunciation distances to the proto-
language we reconstructed ourselves and 
correlated them with pronunciation dis-
tances we measured to proto-Germanic 
based on the dictionary. Pronunciation dis-
tances were measured using Levenshtein 
distance, a string edit distance measure. We 
found a relatively strong correlation 
(r=0.87). 
1 Introduction 
In Dutch dialectology the Reeks Nederlandse Dia-
lectatlassen (RND), compiled by Blancquaert & 
P?e (1925-1982) is an invaluable data source. The 
atlases cover the Dutch language area. The Dutch 
area comprises The Netherlands, the northern part 
of Belgium (Flanders), a smaller northwestern part 
of France, and the German county of Bentheim. 
The RND contains 1956 varieties, which can be 
found in 16 volumes. For each dialect 139 sen-
tences are translated and transcribed in phonetic 
script. Blancquaert mentions that the questionnaire 
used for this atlas was conceived of as a range of 
sentences with words that illustrate particular 
sounds. The design was such that, e.g., various 
changes of older Germanic vowels, diphthongs and 
consonants are represented in the questionnaire 
(Blancquaert 1948, p. 13). We exploit here the his-
torical information in this atlas.  
The goals of this paper are twofold. First we aim 
to reconstruct a ?proto-language? on the basis of 
the RND dialect material and see how close we 
come to the protoforms found in Gerhard K?bler?s 
neuhochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch 
(K?bler, 2003). We recognize that we actually re-
construct a stage that would never have existed in 
prehistory. In practice, however, we are usually 
forced to use incomplete data, since data collec-
tions -- such as the RND ? are restricted by politi-
cal boundaries, and often some varieties are lost.  
In this paper we show the usefulness of a data 
source like the RND. 
Second we want to measure the divergence of 
Dutch dialects compared to their proto-language. 
We measure the divergence of the dialect pronun-
ciations. We do not measure the number of 
changes that happened in the course of time. For 
31
example if a [u] changed into a [y] and then the [y] 
changed into a [u], we simply compare the [u] to 
the proto-language pronunciation. However, we do 
compare Dutch dialects to both the proto-language 
we reconstruct ourselves, which we call Proto-
Language Reconstructed (PLR), and to the Proto-
language according to the proto-Germanic Dic-
tionary, which we call Proto-Germanic according 
to the Dictionary (PGD). 
2 Reconstructing the proto-language 
From the nearly 2000 varieties in the RND we 
selected 360 representative dialects from locations 
in the Dutch language area. The density of 
locations is about the same everywhere. 
In the RND, the same 141 sentences are trans-
lated and transcribed in phonetic script for each 
dialect. Since digitizing the phonetic texts is time-
consuming on the one hand, and since our proce-
dure for measuring pronunciation distances is a 
word-based method on the other hand, we initially 
selected from the text only 125 words.  Each set 
represents a set of potential cognates, inasmuch as 
they were taken from translations of the same sen-
tence in each case. In K?bler?s dictionary we found 
translations of 85 words only; therefore our analy-
ses are based on those 85 words. 
We use the comparative method (CM) as the 
main tool for reconstructing a proto-form on the 
basis of the RND material. In the following sub-
sections we discuss the reconstruction of vowels 
and consonants respectively. 
2.1 Vowels 
For the reconstruction of vowels we used knowl-
edge about sound developments in the history of 
Dutch. In Old Dutch the diphthongs // and // 
turned into monophthongs // and // respectively 
(Quak & van der Horst 2002, p. 32). Van Bree 
(1996) mentions the tendencies that lead // and 
// to change into // and // respectively. From 
these data we find the following chains: 
 
 ?  ?  ?  
 ? 	 ?  ?  
 
An example is twee ?two? which has the vowel 
[] in 11% of the dialects, the [] in 14% of the 
dialects, the [] in 43% of the dialects and the [] in 
20% of the dialects. 1  According to the neu-
hochdeutsch-germanisches W?rterbuch the [] or 
[] is the original sound. Our data show that sim-
ply reconstructing the most frequent sound, which 
is the [], would not give the original sound, but 
using the chain the original sound is easily found. 
To get evidence that the // has raised to // 
(and probably later to //) in a particular word, we 
need evidence that the // was part of the chain. 
Below we discuss another chain where the // has 
lowered to //, and where the // is missing in the 
chain. To be sure that the // was part of the chain, 
we consider the frequency of the //, i.e. the num-
ber of dialects with // in that particular word. The 
frequency of // should be higher than the fre-
quency of // and/or higher than the frequency of 
//. Similarly for the change from // to // we 
consider the frequency of //. 
Another development mentioned by Van Bree is 
that high monophthongs diphthongize. In the tran-
sition from middle Dutch to modern Dutch, the 
monophthong // changed into //, and the mo-
nophthong /
/ changed into either /
/ or /	/ 
(Van der Wal, 1994). According to Van Bree 
(1996, p. 99), diphthongs have the tendency to 
lower. This can be observed in Polder Dutch where 
// and /
/ are lowered to // and // (Stroop 
1998). We recognize the following chains: 
 
 ?  ?  

 ? 
/	 ?  
 ? 	 ?  
 
Different from the chains mentioned above, we 
do not find the // and // respectively in these 
chains. To get evidence for these chains, the fre-
quency of // should be lower than both the fre-
quency of // and //, and the frequency of // 
should be lower than both /	/ and //.  
Sweet (1888, p. 20) observes that vowels have 
the tendency to move from back to front. Back 
                                                 
1
 The sounds mentioned may be either monophthongs or 
diphthongs. 
32
vowels favour rounding, and front vowels un-
rounding. From this, we derive five chains: 
 
 ? 
 ?  
 ?  ?  
 ?  ?  
 ?  ? 	 
 ? ? ?  
 
However, unrounded front vowels might be-
come rounded under influence from a labial or 
labiodental consonant. For example vijf ?five? is 
sometimes pronounced as [] and sometimes as 
[
]. The [] has been changed into [
] under in-
fluence of the labiodental [] and []. 
Sweet (1888, p. 22) writes that the dropping of 
unstressed vowels is generally preceded by various 
weakenings in the direction of a vowel close to 
schwa. In our data we found that the word mijn 
?my? is sometimes [] and sometimes []. A non-
central unstressed vowel might change into a cen-
tral vowel which in turn might be dropped. In gen-
eral we assume that deletion of vowels is more 
likely than insertion of vowels. 
Most words in our data have one syllable. For 
each word we made an inventory of the vowels 
used across the 360 varieties. We might recognize 
a chain in the data on the basis of vowels which 
appear at least two times in the data. For 37 words 
we could apply the tendencies mentioned above. In 
the other cases, we reconstruct the vowel by using 
the vowel found most frequently among the 360 
varieties, working with Occam?s Razor as a guid-
ing principle. When both monophthongs and diph-
thongs are found among the data, we choose the 
most frequent monophthong. Sweet (1888, p. 21) 
writes that isolative diphthongizaton ?mainly af-
fects long vowels, evidently because of the diffi-
culty of prolonging the same position without 
change.? 
2.2 Consonants 
For the reconstruction of consonants we used ten 
tendencies which we discuss one by one below. 
Initial and medial voiceless obstruents become 
voiced when (preceded and) followed by a voiced 
sound. Hock & Joseph (1996) write that weakening 
(or lenition) ?occurs most commonly in a medial 
voiced environment (just like Verner?s law), but 
may be found in other contexts as well.? In our 
data set zes ?six? is pronounced with a initial [] in 
most cases and with an initial [] in the dialects of 
Stiens and Dokkum. We reconstructed [].2 
Final voiced obstruents of an utterance become 
voiceless. Sweet (1888, p. 18) writes that the natu-
ral isolative tendency is to change voice into un-
voiced. He also writes that the ?tendency to un-
voicing is shown most strongly in the stops.? Hock 
& Joseph (1996, p. 129) write that final devoicing 
?is not confined to utterance-final position but ap-
plies word-finally as well.? 3  In our data set we 
found that for example the word-final consonant  
in op ?on? is sometimes a [p] and sometimes a [b]. 
Based on this tendency, we reconstruct the [b]. 
Plosives become fricatives between vowels, be-
fore vowels or sonorants (when initial), or after 
vowels (when final). Sweet writes that the ?opening 
of stops generally seems to begin between vow-
els?? (p. 23). Somewhat further he writes that in 
Dutch the g has everywhere become a fricative 
while in German the initial g remained a stop. For 
example goed ?good? is pronounced as [] in 
Frisian dialects, while other dialects have initial [] 
or []. Following the tendency, we consider the [] 
to be the older sound. Related to this is the pronun-
ciation of words like schip ?ship? and school 
?school?. As initial consonants we found [sk], [sx] 
and []. In cases like this we consider the [sk] as 
the original form, although the [k] is not found be-
tween vowels, but only before a vowel. 
Oral vowels become nasalized before nasals. 
Sweet (1888) writes that ?nothing is more common  
than the nasalizing influence of a nasal on a pre-
ceding vowels? and that there ?is a tendency to 
drop the following nasal consonant as superfluous? 
when ?the nasality of a vowel is clearly developed? 
and ?the nasal consonant is final, or stands before 
another consonant.? (p. 38) For example gaan ?to 
go? is pronounced as [] in the dialect of Dok-
                                                 
2
 In essence, in this and other such cases, a version of 
the manuscript-editing principle of choosing the 
?lectio difficilior? was our guiding principle.  
3
 We do feel, however, that word-final devoicing, even 
though common cross-linguistically, is, as Hock 
1976 emphasizes, not phonetically determined but 
rather reflects the generalization of utterance-final 
developments into word-final position, owing to the 
overlap between utterance-finality and word-finality. 
33
kum, and as [] in the dialect of Stiens. The na-
salized [] in the pronunciation of Stiens already 
indicates the deletion of a following nasal.  
Consonants become palatalized before front 
vowels. According to Campbell (2004) ?palataliza-
tion often takes place before or after i and j or be-
fore other front vowels, depending on the lan-
guage, although unconditioned palatalization can 
also take place.? An example might be vuur which 
is pronounced like [] in Frisian varieties, 
while most other varieties have initial [] or [] 
followed by [] or [
]. 
Superfluous sounds are dropped. Sweet (1888) 
introduced this principle as one of the principles of 
economy (p. 49). He especially mentioned that in 
[ ] the superfluous [] is often dropped (p. 42). In 
our data we found that krom ?curved? is pro-
nounced [!"] in most cases, but as [!"#] in 
the dialect of Houthalen. In the reconstructed form 
we posit the final [#]. 
Medial [h] deletes between vowels, and initial 
[h] before vowels. The word hart ?heart? is some-
times pronounced with and sometimes without ini-
tial [$]. According to this principle we reconstruct 
the [$]. 
[r] changes to []. According to Hock and Jo-
seph (1996) the substitution of uvular [%] for trilled 
(post-)dental [] is an example of an occasional 
change apparently resulting from misperception. In 
the word rijp ?ripe? we find initial [] in most cases 
and [%] in the dialects of Echt and Baelen. We re-
constructed []. 
Syllable initial [w] changes in []. Under ?Lip 
to Lip-teeth? Sweet (1888) writes that in ?the 
change of p into f, w into v, we may always assume 
an intermediate [&], ['],  the latter being the Mid-
dle German w? (p. 26), and that  the ?loss of back 
modification is shown in the frequent change of 
(w) into (v) through ['], as in Gm.? Since v ? 
meant as ?voiced lip-to-teeth fricative? ? is close to 
[(] ? lip-to-teeth sonorant ?  we reconstruct [)] if 
both [)] and [(] are found in the dialect pronuncia-
tions. This happens for example in the word wijn 
?wine?. 
The cluster ol+d/t diphthongizes to ou + d/t. For 
example English old and German alt have a /l/ be-
fore the /d/ and /t/ respectively. In Old Dutch ol 
changed into ou (Van Loey 1967, p. 43, Van Bree 
1987, p. 135/136). Therefore we reconstruct the /l/ 
with preceding // or //. 
3 The proto-language according to the 
dictionary 
The dictionary of K?bler (2003) provides Ger-
manic proto-forms. In our Dutch dialect data set 
we have transcriptions of 125 words per dialect. 
We found 85 words in the dictionary. Other words 
were missing, especially plural nouns, and verb 
forms other than infinitives are not included in this 
dictionary. 
For most words, many proto-Germanic forms 
are given. We used the forms in italics only since 
these are the main forms according to the author. If 
different lexical forms are given for the same 
word, we selected only variants of those lexical 
forms which appear in standard Dutch or in one of 
the Dutch dialects. 
The proto-forms are given in a semi-phonetic 
script. We converted them to phonetic script in 
order to make them as comparable as possible to 
the existing Dutch dialect transcriptions. This ne-
cessitated some interpretation. We made the fol-
lowing interpretation for monophthongs: 
 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic 
 *  +*  *
 *  +*  *
 * 	 * 
 	*
 * 	  * 
 *
 
Diphthongs are interpreted as follows: 
 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic 
ai * ei *
au * eu *
 
We interpreted the consonants according to the 
following scheme: 
 
 
 
 
34
spel-
ling 
pho- 
netic 
spel- 
ling 
pho- 
netic

 t *  s * ng  *
 d -*  z * w ) 
 k !*  h  , $* r *
 g , *   l .*
    j *
 
Lehmann (2005-2007) writes that in the early 
stage  of Proto-Germanic ?each of the obstruents 
had the same pronunciation in its various 
locations??. ?Later, /b d g/ had fricative 
allophones when medial between vowels. 
Lehmann (1994) writes that in  Gothic ?/b, d, g/ 
has stop articulation initially, finally and when 
doubled, fricative articulation between vowels.? 
We adopted this scheme, but were restricted by the 
RND consonant set. The fricative articulation of 
/,/ would be ['] or []. We selected the [] since 
this sound is included in the RND set. The fricative 
articulation of /-/ would be [/], but this consonant 
is not in the RND set. We therefore used the [-] 
which we judge perceptually to be closer to the [/] 
than to the []. The fricative articulation of // is 
// which was available in the RND set. 
We interpreted the h as [$] in initial position, 
and as [] in medial and final positions. An n be-
fore k, g or h is interpreted as [ ], and as [] in all 
other cases. The  should actually be interpreted as 
[0], but this sound in not found in the RND set. 
Just as we use [-] for [/], analogously we use [] 
for [0]. We interpret double consonants are gemi-
nates, and transcribe them as single long conso-
nants. For example nn becomes []. 
Several words end in a ?-? in K?bler?s diction-
ary, meaning that the final sounds are unknown or 
irrelevant to root and stem reconstructions. In our 
transcriptions, we simply note nothing.  
4 Measuring divergence of Dutch dialect 
pronunciations with respect to their 
proto-language 
Once a protolanguage is reconstructed, we are able 
to measure the divergence of the pronunciations of 
descendant varieties with respect to that protolan-
guage. For this purpose we use Levenshtein dis-
tance, which is explained in Section 4.1. In Sec-
tions 4.2 the Dutch dialects are compared to PLR 
and PGD respectively. In Section 4.3 we compare 
PLR with PGD. 
4.1 Levenshtein distance 
In 1995 Kessler introduced the Levenshtein dis-
tance as a tool for measuring linguistic distances 
between language varieties. The Levenshtein dis-
tance is a string edit distance measure, and Kessler 
applied this algorithm to the comparison of Irish 
dialects. Later the same technique was successfully 
applied to Dutch (Nerbonne et al 1996; Heeringa 
2004: 213?278). Below, we give a brief explana-
tion of the methodology. For a more extensive ex-
planation see Heeringa (2004: 121?135). 
 
4.1.1 Algorithm 
 
Using the Levenshtein distance, two varieties are 
compared by measuring the pronunciation of 
words in the first variety against the pronunciation 
of the same words in the second. We determine 
how one pronunciation might be transformed into 
the other by inserting, deleting or substituting 
sounds. Weights are assigned to these three opera-
tions. In the simplest form of the algorithm, all op-
erations have the same cost, e.g., 1. 
Assume the Dutch word hart ?heart? is pro-
nounced as [$] in the dialect of Vianen (The 
Netherlands) and as [+] in the dialect of Naz-
areth (Belgium). Changing one pronunciation into 
the other can be done as follows: 
*
$  delete $   1 
  subst. /+  1 
+  insert    1 
+*
???????????????? 
     3 
35
In fact many string operations map [$] to 
[+]. The power of the Levenshtein algorithm is 
that it always finds the least costly mapping. 
To deal with syllabification in words, the 
Levenshtein algorithm is adapted so that only a 
vowel may match with a vowel, a consonant with a 
consonant, the [j] or [w] with a vowel (or oppo-
site), the [i] or [u] with a consonant (or opposite), 
and a central vowel (in our research only the 
schwa) with a sonorant (or opposite). In this way 
unlikely matches (e.g. a [p] with an [a]) are pre-
vented.4   The longest alignment has the greatest 
number of matches. In our example we thus have 
the following alignment: 
 
$* * * *
* * +* * * *
?????????????? 
1 1   1 
 
4.1.2 Operations weights 
 
The simplest versions of this method are based on 
a notion of phonetic distance in which phonetic 
overlap is binary: non-identical phones contribute 
to phonetic distance, identical ones do not. Thus 
the pair [,1] counts as different to the same degree 
as [,]. The version of the Levenshtein algorithm 
which we use in this paper is based on the com-
parison of spectrograms of the sounds. Since a 
spectrogram is the visual representation of the 
acoustical signal, the visual differences between 
the spectrograms are reflections of the acoustical 
differences. The spectrograms were made on the 
basis of recordings of the sounds of the Interna-
tional Phonetic Alphabet as pronounced by John 
Wells and Jill House on the cassette The Sounds of 
the International Phonetic Alphabet from 1995. 5 
The different sounds were isolated from the re-
cordings and monotonized at the mean pitch of 
each of the two speakers with the program 
PRAAT6 (Boersma & Weenink, 2005). Next, for 
                                                 
4
 Rather than matching a vowel with a consonant, the 
algorithm will consider one of them as an insertion 
and another as a deletion.

 The program PRAAT is a free public-domain program 
developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink at 
each sound a spectrogram was made with PRAAT 
using the so-called Barkfilter, a perceptually ori-
ented model. On the basis of the Barkfilter repre-
sentation, segment distances were calculated. In-
serted or deleted segments are compared to silence, 
and silence is represented as a spectrogram in 
which all intensities of all frequencies are equal to 
0. We found that the [2] is closest to silence and 
the [] is most distant. This approach is described 
extensively in Heeringa (2004, pp. 79-119).  
In perception, small differences in pronunciation 
may play a relatively strong role in comparison to 
larger differences. Therefore we used logarithmic 
segment distances. The effect of using logarithmic 
distances is that small distances are weighted rela-
tively more heavily than large distances. 
 
4.1.3 Processing RND data 
 
The RND transcribers use slightly different nota-
tions. In order to minimize the effect of these dif-
ferences, we normalized the data for them. The 
consistency problems and the way we solved them 
are extensively discussed in Heeringa (2001) and 
Heeringa (2004). Here we mention one problem 
which is highly relevant in the context of this pa-
per. In the RND the ee before r is transcribed as 
[] by some transcribers and as [] by other tran-
scribers, although they mean the same pronuncia-
tion as appears from the introductions of the differ-
ent atlas volumes. A similar problem is found for 
oo before r which is transcribed either as  [] or  
[], and the eu before r which is transcribed as [] 
or []. Since similar problems may occur in other 
contexts as well, the best solution to overcome all 
of these problems appeared to replace all []?s by 
[]?s, all []?s  by []?s, and all []?s by []?s, even 
though meaningful distinctions get lost. 
Especially suprasegmentals and diacritics might 
be used diffferently by the transcribers. We process 
the diacritics voiceless, voiced and nasal only. For 
details see Heeringa (2004, p. 110-111). 
The distance between a monophthong and a 
diphthong is calculated as the mean of the distance 
between the monophthong and the first element of

University of Amsterdam and is available at

the diphthong and the distance between the mo-
nophthong and the second element of the diph-
thong. The distance between two diphthongs is 
calculated as the mean of the distance between the 
first elements and the distance between the second 
elements. Details are given in Heeringa (2004, p. 
108). 
4.2 Measuring divergence from the proto-
languages 
The Levenshtein distance enables us to compare 
each of the 360 Dutch dialects to PLR and PGD. 
Since we reconstructed 85 words, the distance be-
tween a dialect and a proto-language is equal to the 
average of the distances of 85 word pairs. 
Figures 1 and 2 show the distances to PLR and 
PGD respectively. Dialects with a small distance 
are represented by a lighter color and those with a 
large distance by a darker color. In the map, dia-
lects are represented by polygons, geographic dia-
lect islands are represented by colored dots, and 
linguistic dialect islands are represented by dia-
monds. The darker a polygon, dot or diamond, the 
greater the distance to the proto-language. 
The two maps show similar patterns. The dia-
lects in the Northwest (Friesland), the West 
(Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht) and in the 
middle (Noord-Brabant) are relatively close to the 
proto-languages. More distant are dialects in the 
Northeast (Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel), in the 
Southeast (Limburg), close to the middle part of 
the Flemish/Walloon border (Brabant) and in the 
southwest close to the Belgian/French state border 
(West-Vlaanderen).  
According to Weijnen (1966), the Frisian, Lim-
burg and West-Flemish dialects are conservative. 
Our maps shows that Frisian is relatively close to 
proto-Germanic, but Limburg and West-Flemish 
are relatively distant. We therefore created two 
maps, one which shows distances to PGD based on 
vowel substitutions in stressed syllables only, and 
another showing distances to PGD on the basis of 
consonant substitutions only.7  
Looking at the map based on vowel substitutions 
we find the vowels of the Dutch province of Lim-
burg and the eastern part of the province Noord-
Brabant relatively close to PGD. Looking at the 
map based on consonant substitutions we find the 
consonants of the Limburg varieties distant to

PGD. The Limburg dialects have shared in the 
High German Consonant Shift. Both the Belgium 
and Dutch Limburg dialects are found east of the 
Uerdinger Line between Dutch ik/ook/-lijk and 
High German ich/auch/-lich. The Dutch Limburg 
dialects are found east of the Panninger Line be-
tween Dutch sl/sm/sn/sp/st/zw and High German 
schl/schm/schn/schp/scht/schw (Weijnen 1966). 
The Limburg dialects are also characterized by the 
uvular [%] while most Dutch dialects have the al-
veolar []. All of this shows that Limburg conso-
nants are innovative. 
The map based on vowel substitutions shows 
that Frisian vowels are not particularly close to 
PGD. Frisian is influenced by the Ingvaeonic 
sound shift. Among other changes, the [] changed 
into [], which in turn changed into [] in some 
cases (Dutch dun ?thin? is Frisian tin) (Van Bree 
1987, p. 69).8 Besides, Frisian is characterized by 
its falling diphthongs, which are an innovation as 
well. When we consulted the map based on conso-
nant substitutions, we found the Frisian consonants 
close to PGD. For example the initial /g/ is still 
pronounced as a plosive as in most other Germanic 
varieties, but in Dutch dialects ? and in  standard 
Dutch ? as a fricative. 
When we consider West-Flemish, we find the 
vowels closer to PGD than the consonants, but 
they are still relatively distant to PGD. 
4.3 PLR versus PGD 
When correlating the 360 dialect distances to PLR 
with the 360 dialect distances to PGD, we obtained 
a correlation of r=0.87 (p<0.0001)9. This is a sig-
nificant, but not perfect correlation. Therefore we 
compared the word transcriptions of PLR with 
those of PGD.

 The Ingvaeonic sound shift affected mainly Frisian 
and English, and to a lesser degree Dutch. We 
mention here the phenomenon found in our data 
most frequently.

 Figure 1. Distances of 360 Dutch dialects com-
pared to PLR. Dialects are represented by poly-
gons, geographic dialect islands are represented by 
colored dots, and linguistic dialect islands are rep-
resented by diamonds. Lighter polygons, dots or 
diamonds represent more conservative dialects and 
darker ones more innovative dialects. 
 
First we focus on the reconstruction of vowels. 
We find 28 words for which the reconstructed 
vowel of the stressed syllable was the same as in 
PGD10. In 15 cases, this was the result of applying 
the tendencies discussed in Section 2.1. In 13 cases 
this was the result of simply choosing the vowel 
found most frequently among the 360 word pro-
nunciations. When we do not use tendencies, but 
simply always choose the most frequent vowel, we 
obtain a correlation which is significantly lower 
(r=0.74, p=0). 
We found 29 words for which vowel was recon-
structed different from the one in PGD, although 
the PGD vowel was found among at least two dia-
lects. For 28 words the vowel in the PGD form was 
not found among the 360 dialects, or only one 
time. For 11 of these words, the closest vowel 
found in the inventory of that word, was recon-
structed. For example the vowel in ook ?too? is 
[] in PGD, while we reconstructed [	].

 For some words PGD gives multiple pronunciations. 
We count the number of words which has the same 
vowel in at least one of the PGD pronunciations. 
 
Figure 2. Distances of 360 Dutch dialects com-
pared to PGD. Dialects are represented by poly-
gons, geographic dialect islands are represented by 
colored dots, and linguistic dialect islands are rep-
resented by diamonds. Lighter polygons, dots or 
diamonds represent more conservative dialects and 
darker ones more innovative dialects. 
 
Looking at the consonants, we found 44 words 
which have the same consonants as in PGD.11 For 
36 words only one consonant was different, where 
most words have at least two consonants. This 
shows that the reconstruction of consonants works 
much better than the reconstruction of vowels. 
5 Conclusions 
In this paper we tried to reconstruct a ?proto-
language? on the basis of the RND dialect material 
and see how close we come to the protoforms 
found in K?bler?s proto-Germanic dictionary. We 
reconstructed the same vowel as in PGD or the 
closest possible vowel for 46% of the words. 
Therefore, the reconstruction of vowels still needs 
to be improved further.  
The reconstructions of consonants worked well. 
For 52% of the words all consonants reconstructed  
are the same as in PGD. For 42% of the words, 
only one consonant was differently reconstructed. 
And, as a second goal, we measured the diver-
gence of Dutch dialects compared to their proto-

 When PGD has multiple pronunciations, we count the 
number of words for which the consonants are the 
same as in at least one of the PGD pronunciations.

language. We calculated dialect distances to PLR 
and PGD, and found a correlation of r=0.87 be-
tween the PLR distances and PGD distances. The 
high correlation shows the relative influence of 
wrongly reconstructed sounds.  
When we compared dialects to PLR and PGD, 
we found especially Frisian close to proto-
Germanic. When we distinguished between vowels 
and consonants, it appeared that southeastern dia-
lects (Dutch Limburg and the eastern part of 
Noord-Brabant) have vowels close to proto-
Germanic. Frisian is relatively close to proto-
Germanic because of its consonants.
