Abstract 
This paper examines language similarity 
in messages over time in an online com-
munity of adolescents from around the 
world using three computational meas-
ures: Spearman?s Correlation Coefficient, 
Zipping and Latent Semantic Analysis.  
Results suggest that the participants? lan-
guage diverges over a six-week period, 
and that divergence is not mediated by 
demographic variables such as leadership 
status or gender.  This divergence may 
represent the introduction of more unique 
words over time, and is influenced by a 
continual change in subtopics over time, 
as well as community-wide historical 
events that introduce new vocabulary at 
later time periods. Our results highlight 
both the possibilities and shortcomings of 
using document similarity measures to as-
sess convergence in language use. 
1 Introduction 
While document similarity has been a concern in 
computational linguistics for some time, less atten-
tion has been paid to change in similarity across 
time.  And yet, while historical linguists have long 
addressed the issue of divergence or convergence 
among language groups over long periods of time, 
there has also been increasing interest in conver-
gence (also referred to as entrainment, speech ac-
commodation, or alignment) in other areas of 
Linguistics, with the realization that we have little 
understanding of change in very short periods of 
time, such as months, in a particular conversational 
setting, between two people, or in a large group. 
The Internet provides an ideal opportunity to ex-
amine questions of this sort since all texts perse-
vere for later analysis, and the diversity in kinds of 
online communities ensures that the influence of 
social behavior on language can be examined. Yet 
there has been very little work on language similar-
ity in online communities.  
In this paper we compare the use of three sepa-
rate tools to measure document or message similar-
ity in a large data set from an online community of 
over 3,000 participants from 140 different coun-
tries.  Based on a review of related work on corpus 
similarity measures and document comparison 
techniques (Section 2.2), we chose Spearman?s 
Correlation Coefficient, a comparison algorithm 
that utilizes GZIP (which we will refer to as ?Zip-
ping?) and Latent Semantic Analysis. These three 
tools have all been shown effective for document 
comparison or corpus similarity, but never to our 
knowledge have any of them been used for docu-
ment similarity over time, nor have they been 
compared to one another. Even though each of 
these tools is quite different in what it specifically 
measures and how it is used, and each has been 
used by quite different communities of researchers, 
they are all fairly well-understood (Section 4).  
2 Related Work  
In the next sections, we review literature on lan-
guage similarity or convergence.  We also review 
literature on the three computational tools, Spear-
man?s Correlation Coefficient (SCC), Zipping, and 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). 
2.1 Language Similarity in Computer-
mediated Communication 
In dyadic settings, speakers often converge to one 
another?s speech styles, not only matching the 
choice of referring expressions or other words, but 
also structural dimensions such as syntax, sound 
characteristics such as accent, prosody, or phonol-
15
ogy, or even non-verbal behaviors such as gesture 
(Brennan & Clark, 1996; Street & Giles, 1982). 
Some scholars suggest that this convergence or 
entrainment is based on a conscious need to ac-
commodate to one?s conversational partner, or as a 
strategy to maximize communication effectiveness 
(Street & Giles, 1982). Others suggest that the 
alignment is an automatic response, in which 
echoic aspects of speech, gesture and facial expres-
sions are unconscious reactions (Garrod & Ander-
son, 1987; Lakin, Jefferies, Cheng, & Chartrand, 
2003).  In short, conversational partners tend to 
accommodate to each other by imitating or match-
ing the semantic, syntactic and phonological char-
acteristics of their partners (Brennan & Clark, 
1996; Garrod & Pickering, 2004). 
Many studies have concentrated on dyadic inter-
actions, but large-scale communities also demon-
strate language similarity or convergence. In fact, 
speech communities have a strong influence in cre-
ating and maintaining language patterns, including 
word choice or phonological characteristics 
(Labov, 2001). Language use often plays an impor-
tant role in constituting a group or community 
identity (Eckert, 2003).  For example, language 
?norms? in a speech community often result in the 
conformity of new members in terms of accent or 
lexical choice (Milroy, 1980).  This effect has been 
quite clear among non-native speakers, who 
quickly pick up the vernacular and speech patterns 
of their new situation (Chambers, 2001), but the 
opposite is also true, with native speakers picking 
up speech patterns from non-native speakers (Auer 
& Hinskens, 2005) 
Linguistic innovation is particularly salient on 
the Internet, where words and linguistic patterns 
have been manipulated or reconstructed by indi-
viduals and quickly adopted by a critical mass of 
users (Crystal, 2001).  Niederhoffer & Pennebaker 
(2002) found that users of instant messenger tend 
to match each other?s linguistic styles.  A study of 
language socialization in a bilingual chat room 
suggests that participants developed particular lin-
guistic patterns and both native and non-native 
speakers were influenced by the other (Lam, 
2004).  Similar language socialization has been 
found in ethnographic research of large-scale 
online communities as well, in which various ex-
pressions are created and shared by group mem-
bers (Baym, 2000; Cherny, 1999). 
Other research not only confirms the creation of 
new linguistic patterns online, and subsequent 
adoption by users, but suggests that the strength of 
the social ties between participants influences how 
patterns are spread and adopted (Paolillo, 2001).  
However, little research has been devoted to how 
language changes over longer periods of time in 
these online communities. 
2.2 Computational Measures of Language 
Similarity 
The unit of analysis in online communities is the 
(e-mail or chat) message.  Therefore, measuring 
entrainment in online communities relies on as-
sessing whether or not similarity between the mes-
sages of each participant increases over time. Most 
techniques for measuring document similarity rely 
on the analysis of word frequencies and their co-
occurrence in two or more corpora (Kilgarriff, 
2001), so we start with these techniques. 
Spearman?s Rank Correlation Coefficient (SCC) 
is particularly useful because it is easy to compute 
and not dependent on text size. Unlike some other 
statistical approaches (e.g. chi-square), SCC has 
been shown effective on determining similarity 
between corpora of varying sizes, therefore SCC 
will serve as a baseline for comparison in this pa-
per (Kilgarriff, 2001). 
More recently, researchers have experimented 
with data compression algorithms as a measure of 
document complexity and similarity.  This tech-
nique uses compression ratios as an approximation 
of a document?s information entropy (Baronchelli, 
Caglioti, & Loreto, 2005; Benedetto, Caglioti, & 
Loreto, 2002).  Standard Zipping algorithms have 
demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of docu-
ment comparison and classification tasks. Behr et 
al. (2003) found that a document and its translation 
into another language compressed to approxi-
mately the same size. They suggest that this could 
be used as an automatic measure for testing ma-
chine translation quality. Kaltchenko (2004) argues 
that using compression algorithms to compute rela-
tive entropy is more relevant than using distances 
based on Kolmogorov complexity. Lastly, Ben-
detto et al (2002) present some basic findings us-
ing GZIP for authorship attribution, determining 
the language of a document, and building a tree of 
language families from a text written in different 
languages.  Although Zipping may be a conten-
16
tious technique, these results present intriguing 
reasons to continue exploration of its applications. 
Latent Semantic Analysis is another technique 
used for measuring document similarity.  LSA em-
ploys a vector-based model to capture the seman-
tics of words by applying Singular Value 
Decomposition on a term-document matrix 
(Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998).  LSA has been 
successfully applied to tasks such as measuring 
semantic similarity among corpora of texts 
(Coccaro & Jurafsky, 1998), measuring cohesion 
(Foltz, Kintsch, & Landauer, 1998 ), assessing cor-
rectness of answers in tutoring systems (Wiemer-
Hastings & Graesser, 2000) and dialogue act clas-
sification (Serafin & Di Eugenio, 2004). 
To our knowledge, statistical measures like 
SCC, Zipping compression algorithms, or LSA 
have never been used to measure similarity of mes-
sages over time, nor have they been applied to 
online communities. However, it is not obvious 
how we would verify their performance, and given 
the nature of the task ? similarity in over 15,000 e-
mail messages ? it is impossible to compare the 
computational methods to hand-coding. As a pre-
liminary approach, we therefore decided to apply 
all three methods in turn to the messages in an 
online community to examine change in linguistic 
similarity over time, and to compare their results. 
Through the combination of lexical, phrasal and 
semantic similarity metrics, we hope to gain in-
sight into the questions of whether entrainment 
occurs in online communities, and of what compu-
tational measures can be used to measure it. 
2.3 The Junior Summit  
The Junior Summit launched in 1998 as a closed 
online community for young people to discuss how 
to use technology to make the world better.  3000 
children ages 10 to 16 participated in 1000 teams 
(some as individuals and some with friends).  Par-
ticipants came from 139 different countries, and 
could choose to write in any of 5 languages.  After 
2 weeks online, the young people divided into 20 
topic groups of their own choosing.  Each of these 
topic groups functioned as a smaller community 
within the community of the Junior Summit; after 
another 6 weeks, each topic group elected 5 dele-
gates to come to the US for an in-person forum.  
The dataset from the Junior Summit comprises 
more than 40,000 e-mail messages; however, in the 
current paper we look at only a sub-set of these 
data ? messages written in English during the 6-
week topic group period.  For complete details, 
please refer to Cassell & Tversky (2005).  
3 The Current Study 
In this paper, we examine entrainment among 419 
of the 1000 user groups (the ones who wrote in 
English) and among the 15366 messages they 
wrote over a six-week period (with participants 
divided into 20 topic groups, with an average of 
20.95 English writers per group).  We ask whether 
the young people?s language converges over time 
in an online community. Is similarity between the 
texts that are produced by the young people greater 
between adjacent weeks than between the less 
proximally-related weeks? Furthermore, what 
computational tools can effectively measure trends 
in similarity over time? 
3.1 Hypotheses 
In order to address these questions, we chose to 
examine change in similarity scores along two di-
mensions: (1) at the level of the individual; and (2) 
across the group as a whole. More specifically, we 
examine similarity between all pairs of individuals 
in a given topic group over time.  We also com-
pared similarity across the entire group at different 
time periods.  
As depicted below, we first look at pairwise 
comparisons between the messages of participants 
in a particular topic group within a given time pe-
riod, Tk (one week). For every pair of participants 
in a group, we calculated the similarity between 
two documents, each comprising all messages for a 
participant in the pair.  Then we averaged the 
scores computed for all topic groups within a time 
period Tk and produced PTk, the average, pairwise 
similarity score for Tk.  Our first hypothesis is that 
the average, pairwise similarity will increase over 
time, such that: 
 
PT1 < PT2 < PT3 < PT4 < PT5 < PT6 
 
For our second set of tests, we compared all 
messages from a single time period to all messages 
of a previous time period within a single topic 
group. Our hypothesis was that temporal proximity 
would correlate with mean similarity, such that the 
messages of two adjacent time periods would ex-
hibit more similarity than those of more distant 
17
time periods.  In order to examine this, we perform 
two individual hypothesis tests, where Mk is the 
document containing all the messages produced in 
time period Tk, and S(X,Y) is the similarity score 
for the two documents X and Y. 
 
a) S(Mk, Mk-1) > S(Mk, Mk-2) 
b) S(Mk, Mk-1) > S(Mk, M1) 
 
Finally, we posit that SCC, Zipping and LSA 
will yield similar results for these tests. 
4 Method  
To prepare the data, we wrote a script to remove 
the parts of messages that could interfere with 
computing their similarity, in particular quoted 
messages and binary attachments, which are com-
mon in a corpus of email-like messages.  We also 
removed punctuation and special characters. 
4.1 Spearman?s Correlation Coefficient 
SCC is calculated as in Kilgarriff (2001). First, we 
compile a list of the common words between the 
two documents. The statistic can be calculated on 
the n most common words, or on all common 
words (i.e. n = total number of common words). 
We applied the latter approach, using all the words 
in common for each document pair. For each docu-
ment, the n common words are ranked by fre-
quency, with the lowest frequency word ranked 1 
and the highest ranked n. For each common word, 
d is the difference in rank orders for the word in 
each document. SCC a normalized sum of the 
squared differences:  
 
The sum is taken over the n most frequent common 
words.  In the case of ties in rank, where more than 
one word in a document occurs with the same fre-
quency, the average of the ranks is assigned to the 
tying words. (For example, if words w1, w2 and w3 
are ranked 5th, 6th and 7th then all three words 
would be assigned the same rank of 5 6 73
+ + = 6). 
4.2 Zipping 
When compressing a document, the resulting com-
pression ratio provides an estimate of the docu-
ment's entropy. Many compression algorithms 
generate a dictionary of sequences based on fre-
quency that is used to compress the document. 
Likewise, one can leverage this technique to de-
termine the similarity between two documents by 
assessing how optimal the dictionary generated 
when compressing one document is when applied 
to another document. We used GZIP for compres-
sion, which employs a combination of the LZ77 
algorithm and Huffman coding.  We based our ap-
proach on the algorithm used by (Benedetto, 
Caglioti, & Loreto, 2002), where the cross-entropy 
per character is defined as:  
Here, A and B are documents; A B+  is docu-
ment B appended to document A; zip(A) is the 
zipped document; and length(A) is the length of the 
document. It is important to note that the test 
document (B) needs to be small enough that it 
doesn't cause the dictionary to adapt to the ap-
pended piece. (Benedetto, Caglioti, & Loreto, 
2002) refer to this threshold as the crossover 
length. The more similar the appended portion is, 
the more it will compress, and vice versa.  We ex-
tended the basic algorithm to handle the extremely 
varied document sizes found in our data. Our algo-
rithm does two one-way comparisons and returns 
the mean score. Each one-way comparison be-
tween two documents, A and B, is computed by 
splitting B into 300 character chunks. Then for 
each chunk, we calculated the cross entropy per 
character when appending the chunk onto A. Each 
one-way comparison returns the mean calculation 
for every chunk.  
We fine-tuned the window size with a small, 
hand-built corpus of news articles.  The differences 
are slightly more pronounced with larger window 
sizes, but that trend starts to taper off between 
window sizes of 300 and 500 characters.  In the 
end we chose 300 as our window size, because it 
provided sufficient contrast and yet still gave a few 
samples from even the smallest documents in our 
primary corpus. 
4.3 Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
For a third approach, we used LSA to analyze the 
semantic similarity between messages across dif-
ferent periods of time. We explored three imple-
length(zip( )) length(zip( ))

mentations of LSA: (a) the traditional algorithm 
described by Foltz et al(1998 )  with one semantic 
space per topic group, (b) the same algorithm but 
with one semantic space for all topic groups and 
(c) an implementation based on Word Space 
(Schutze, 1993) called Infomap. All three were 
tested with several settings such as variations in the 
number of dimensions and levels of control for 
stop words, and all three demonstrated similar re-
sults.  For this paper, we present the Infomap re-
sults due to its wide acceptance among scholars as 
a successful implementation of LSA.  
To account for nuances of the lexicon used in 
the Junior Summit data, we built a semantic space 
from a subset of this data comprised of 7000 small 
messages (under one kb) and 100 dimensions with-
out removing stop words. We then built vectors for 
each document and compared them using cosine 
similarity (Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998).  
5 Results 
The tools we employ approach document similarity 
quite differently; we therefore compare findings as 
a way of triangulating on the nature of entrainment 
in the Junior Summit online community.  
5.1 Pairwise Comparisons over Time 
First, we hypothesized that messages between in-
dividuals in a given topic group would demonstrate 
more similarity over time.  Our findings did not 
support this claim; in fact, they show the opposite.  
All three tests show slight convergence between 
time period one and two, some variation, and then 
divergence between time periods four, five and six. 
Spearman?s Correlation Coefficient demon-
strates a steady decline in similarity.  As shown in 
Figure 1, the differences between time periods 
were all significant, F(5,1375) = 21.475, p<.001, 
where N=1381 (N represents user pairs across all 
six time periods).  
Zipping also shows a significant difference be-
tween each time period, F(5,1190) = 39.027, p<.001, 
N=1196, demonstrating a similar decline in simi-
larity, although not as unwavering.  See Figure 2. 
LSA demonstrates the same divergent trend over 
time, F(5,1410) = 27.139, p<.001, N=1416, with a 
slight spike at T4 and T5.  While the dip at time 3 is 
more pronounced than SCC and Zipping, it is still 
consistent with the overall findings of the other 
measures. See Figure 3.

Because of these surprising findings, we exam-
ined the influence of demographic variables, such 
as leadership (those chosen as delegates from each 
topic group to the in-person forum), gender, and 
the particular topic groups the individuals were a 
part of. We divided delegate pairs into (a) pairs 
where both individuals are delegates; (b) pairs 
where both individuals are non-delegates; and (c) 
mixed pairs of delegates and non-delegates.  Simi-
larly, gender pairs were divided into same-sex 
(e.g., male-male, female-female) and mixed-sex 
19
pairs.  For topic groups, we re-ran our analyses on 
each of the 20 topic groups separately. 
Overall, both leaders and gender pairs demon-
strate the same divergent trends as the group as a 
whole.  However, not all tests showed significant 
differences when comparing these pairs. 
For instance, Spearman?s Correlation Coeffi-
cient found a significant difference in similarity 
between three groups, where F(2,273) = 6.804, 
p<.001, n=276, such that delegate-delegate pairs 
demonstrate higher similarity scores than non-
delegate pairs and mixed pairs.  LSA found the 
same result, F(2,280) = 11.122,  p<.001 n=283. By 
contrast, Zipping did not find this to be the case, 
where F(2,226) = 2.568, p=.079, n=229. 
In terms of the potential effect of gender on 
similarity scores, Zipping showed a significant dif-
ference between the three groups, F(2,236) = 3.546, 
p<.05, n=239, such that female-female pairs and 
mixed-sex pairs demonstrate more similarity than 
male-male pairs. LSA found the same relationship, 
F(2,280) = 4.79, p<.005 n=283.  By contrast, Spear-
man?s Correlation Coefficient does not show a sig-
nificant between-groups difference, F(2,273) = .699, 
p=.498, n=276.  
In terms of differences among the topic groups, 
we did indeed find differences such that some topic 
groups demonstrated the fairly linear slope with 
decreasingly similarity shown above, while others 
demonstrated dips and rises resulting in a level of 
similarity at T6 quite similar to T1.  There is no 
neat way to statistically measure the differences in 
these slopes, but it does indicate that future analy-
ses need to take topic group into account.  
In sum, we did not find leadership or gender to 
mediate language similarity in this community.  
Topic group, on the other hand, did play a role, 
however no topic groups showed increasing simi-
larity across time. 
5.2 Similarity and Temporal Proximity 
Our second hypothesis concerned the gradual 
change of language over time such that temporal 
proximity of time periods would correlate with 
mean similarity.  In other words, we expect that 
messages in close time periods (e.g., adjacent 
weeks) should be more similar than messages from 
more distant time periods.  In order to examine 
this, we performed two individual tests, in which 
our predictions can be described as follows: (a) the 
similarity between texts in one time period and 
texts in the neighboring time period is greater than 
texts in one time period, and texts that came two 
periods previously, S(Mk, Mk-1) > S(Mk, Mk-2); and 
(b) the similarity between texts in one time period 
and texts in the neighboring time period is greater 
than the similarity between texts in one time pe-
riod, and texts in the very first time period, S(Mk, 
Mk-1) > S(Mk, M1). 
As shown in Table 1, SCC and Zipping tests 
confirm these hypotheses, while none of the LSA 
tests revealed significant differences.

6 Discussion 
This work presents several novel contributions 
to the analysis of text-based messages in online 
communities. Using three separate tools, Spear-
man?s Correlation Coefficient, Zipping and Latent 
Semantic Analysis measures, we found that across 
time, members of an online community diverge in 
the language they use.  More specifically, a com-
parison of the words contributed by any pair of 
users in a particular topic group shows increasing 
dissimilarity over the six-week period. 
This finding seems counter-intuitive given work 
in linguistics and psychology, which shows that 
dyads and communities converge, entrain and echo 
each other?s lexical choices and communication 
styles.  Similarly, our own temporal proximity re-
sults appear to indicate convergence, since closer 
time periods are more similar than more distant 
ones.  Finally, previous hand-coding of these data 
revealed convergence, for example between boys 
and girls on the use of emotion words, between 
older and younger children on talk about the future 
(Cassell & Tversky, 2005).  So we ask, why do our 
tools demonstrate this divergent trend? 
We believe that one answer comes from the fact 
that, while the young people may be discussing a 
more restricted range of topics, they are contribut-
ing a wider variety of vocabulary.  In order to ex-
amine whether indeed there were more unique 
20
words over time, we first simply manually com-
pared the frequency of words over time and found 
that, on the contrary, there are consistently fewer 
unique words by T6, which suggests convergence.  
However, there are also fewer and fewer total 
words by the end of the forum.  This is due to the 
number of participants who left the forum after 
they were not elected to go to Boston.  If we divide 
the unique words by the total words, we find that 
the ratio of unique words consistently increases 
over time (see Figure 4).  It is likely that this ratio 
contributes to our results of divergence.

In order to further examine the role of increasing 
vocabulary in the Junior Summit as a whole, we 
also created several control groups comprised of 
random pairs of users (i.e., users that had never 
written to each other), and measured their pairwise 
similarity across time.  The results were similar to 
the experimental groups, demonstrating a slope 
with roughly the same shape.  This argues for con-
vergence and divergence being affected by some-
thing at a broader, community-level such as an 
increase in vocabulary.   
This result is interesting for an additional rea-
son.  Some users ? perhaps particularly non-native 
speakers or younger adolescents, may be learning 
new vocabulary from other speakers, which they 
begin to introduce at later time periods.  An in-
creasingly diversified vocabulary could conceiva-
bly result in differences in word frequency among 
speakers.  This leads us to some key questions: to 
what extent does the language of individuals 
change over time? Is individual language influ-
enced by the language of the community?  This is 
heart of entrainment. 
In conclusion, we have shown that SCC, Zip-
ping and LSA can be used to assess message simi-
larity over time, although they may be somewhat 
blunt instruments for our purposes. In addition, 
while Zipping is somewhat contentious and not as 
widely-accepted as SCC or LSA is, we found that 
the three tools provide very similar results. This is 
particularly interesting given that, while all three 
methods take into account word or word-sequence 
frequencies, LSA is designed to also take into ac-
count aspects of semantics beyond the surface 
level of lexical form.  
All in all, these tools not only contribute to ways 
of measuring similarity across documents, but can 
be utilized in measuring smaller texts, such as 
online messages or emails.  Most importantly, 
these tools remind us how complex and dynamic 
everyday language really is, and how much this 
complexity must be taken into account when build-
ing computational tools for the analysis of text and 
conversation. 
6.1 Future Directions 
In future work, we intend to find ways to compare 
the results obtained from different topic groups and 
also to examine differences among individual us-
ers, including re-running our analyses after remov-
ing outliers.  We also hope to explore the interplay 
between individuals and the community and 
changes in language similarity.  In other words, 
can we find those individuals who may be acquir-
ing new vocabulary? Are there ?language leaders? 
responsible for language change online?   
We also plan to analyze words in terms of their 
local contexts, to see if this changes over time and 
how it impacts our results.  Furthermore, we intend 
to go beyond word frequency to classify topic 
changes over time to get a better understanding of 
the dynamics of the groups (Kaufmann, 1999). 
Finally, as we have done in the past with our 
analyses of this dataset, we would like to perform a 
percentage of hand-coded, human content analysis 
to check reliability of these statistical methods.
