Abstract
Subtle social information is available in text
such as a speaker?s emotional state, intentions,
and attitude, but current information extrac-
tion systems are unable to extract this infor-
mation at the level that humans can. We de-
scribe a methodology for creating databases
of messages annotated with social information
based on interactive games between humans
trying to generate and interpret messages for a
number of different social information types.
We then present some classification results
achieved by using a small-scale database cre-
ated with this methodology.
1 Introduction
A focus of much information extraction research
has been identifying surface-level semantic content
(e.g., identifying who did what to whom when).
In recent years, research on sentiment analysis and
opinion mining has recognized that more subtle in-
formation can be communicated via linguistic fea-
tures in the text (see Pang and Lee (2008) for a re-
view), such as whether text (e.g., a movie review)
is positive or negative (Turney 2002, Pang, Lee,
and Vaithyanathan 2002, Dave, Lawrence, and Pen-
nock 2003, Wiebe et al 2004, Kennedy and Inkpen
2006, Agarwal, Biadsy, and Mckeown 2009, Greene
and Resnik 2009, among many others). However,
other subtle information available in text, such as a
speaker?s emotional states (e.g., anger, embarrass-
ment), intentions (e.g., persuasion, deception), and
attitudes (e.g., disbelief, confidence), has not been
explored as much, though there has been some work
in detecting emotion (e.g., Subasic and Huettner
2001, Alm, Roth, and Sproat 2005, Nicolov et al
2006, Abbasi 2007) and detecting deception (e.g.,
Annolli, Balconi, and Ciceri 2002, Zhou et al 2004,
Gupta and Skillicorn 2006, Zhou and Sung 2008).
This latter kind of social information is useful for
identifying the ?tone? of a message, i.e., for un-
derstanding the underlying intention behind a mes-
sage?s creation, and also for predicting how this
message will be interpreted by humans reading it.
A technical barrier to extracting this kind of social
information is that there are currently no large-scale
text databases that are annotated with social infor-
mation from which to learn the relevant linguistic
cues. That is, there are few examples of social in-
formation ?ground truth? - text annotated with hu-
man perceptions of the social information contained
within the text. Given the success of sentiment anal-
ysis, we believe this social information could also
be retrievable once the relevant linguistic cues are
identified.
One way to create the necessary annotated data
is to draw from computational social science (Lazer
et al 2009), and make use of human-based com-
putation (Kosurokoff 2001, von Ahn 2006, among
others) since humans are used to transmitting so-
cial information through language. In this paper,
we describe a methodology for creating this kind
of database, and then present the results from a
small-scale database created using this methodol-
ogy1. In addition, we show one example of us-

ing this database by training a Sparse Multinomial
Logistic Regression classifier (Krishnapuram et al
2005) on these data.
2 Reliable databases of social information
2.1 The need for databases
In general, reliable databases are required to de-
velop reliable machine learning algorithms. Unfor-
tunately, very few databases annotated with social
information exist, and the few that do are small in
size. A recent addition to the Linguistic Data Con-
sortium demonstrates this: The Language Under-
standing Annotation Corpus (LUAC) by Diab et al
(2009) includes text annotated with committed be-
lief, which ?distinguishes between statements which
assert belief or opinion, those which contain spec-
ulation, and statements which convey fact or oth-
erwise do not convey belief.? This is meant to aid
in determining which beliefs can be ascribed to a
communicator and how strongly the communicator
holds those beliefs. Nonetheless, this is still a small
sample of the possible social information contained
in text. Moreover, the LUAC contains only about
9000 words across two languages (6949 English,
2183 Arabic), which is small compared to the cor-
pora generally available for natural language pro-
cessing (e.g., the English Gigaword corpus (Graff
2003) contains 1756504 words).
Another tack taken by researchers has been to use
open-source data that are likely to demonstrate cer-
tain social information by happenstance, e.g., online
gaming forums with games that happen to involve
the intent to deceive (e.g., Zhou and Sung 2008:
Mafia game forums). While these data sets are larger
in size, they do not have the breadth of coverage in
terms of what social information they can capture
because, by nature, the games only explicitly involve
one kind of social information (e.g., intentions: de-
ception); other social information cannot reliably be
attributed to the text. In general, real world data sets
present the problem of ground truth, i.e., knowing
for certain which emotions, intentions, and attitudes
are conveyed by a particular message.
However, people can often detect social informa-
tion conveyed through text (perhaps parsing it as
the ?tone? of the message). For example, consider
the following message: ?Come on...you have to buy
this.? From only the text itself, we can readily in-
fer that the speaker intends to persuade the listener.
Human-based computation can leverage this ability
from the population, and use it to construct a reli-
able database of social information. Interestingly,
groups of humans are sometimes capable of pro-
ducing much more precise and reliable results than
any particular individual in the group. For example,
Steyvers et al (2009) has shown that such ?wisdom
of crowds? phenomena occur in many knowledge
domains, including human memory, problem solv-
ing, and prediction. In addition, Snow et al (2008)
have demonstrated that a relatively small number of
non-expert annotations in natural language tasks can
achieve the same results as expert annotation.
2.2 Games with a purpose
One approach is to use a game with a purpose
(GWAP) (von Ahn and Dabbish 2004, von Ahn
2006, von Ahn, Kedia, and Blum 2006) that is de-
signed to encourage people to provide the infor-
mation needed in the database. GWAPs are cur-
rently being used to accumulate information about
many things that humans find easy to identify (see
http://www.gwap.com/gwap/ for several examples),
such as objects in images (von Ahn and Dabbish
2004), the musical style of songs, impressions of
sights and sounds in videos, and common sense re-
lationships between concepts (von Ahn, Kedia, and
Blum 2006). In addition, as the collected data comes
from and is vetted by a large number of participants,
we can gauge which messages are reliable examples
of particular social information and which are con-
fusing examples.
2.3 A GWAP for social information in text
We designed a GWAP to create a database of mes-
sages annotated with social information, where un-
paid participants provide knowledge about the social
information in text. The GWAP encourages partici-
pants to both generate messages that reflect specific
social information and to label messages created by
other participants as reflecting specific social infor-
mation. Participants are given points for every mes-
sage they create that is correctly labeled by another
participant, and for every message created by an-
other participant that they correctly label.
Message generators were instructed to generate a
72
message expressing some particular social informa-
tion type (such as persuading), and were allowed to
use a displayed picture as context to guide their mes-
sage, so they would not need to rely completely on
their own imaginations. All context pictures used
in our GWAP were meant to be generic enough
that they could be a basis for a message express-
ing a variety of social information types. Context
pictures were randomly assigned when participants
were asked to generate messages; this meant that, for
example, a picture could be used to generate a per-
suasive message and be used again later to generate
a deceptive message. Generators were also warned
not to use ?taboo? words that would make the social
information too easy to guess 2, but were encour-
aged to express the social information as clearly as
possible. The generator was told that if another par-
ticipant perceived the correct social information type
from the message, the generator would be rewarded
with game points.
Message annotators were instructed to guess
which social information type was being expressed
by the displayed message. They were also shown
the image the generator used as context for the mes-
sage, and were rewarded with points for successful
detection of the intended social information.
As an example of the GWAP in action, one par-
ticipant might generate the message ?Won?t you con-
sider joining our campaign? It?s for a good cause.?
for the social information of persuading; a differ-
ent participant would see this message and might la-
bel it as an example of persuading. A participant
can only label a message with one social informa-
tion type (e.g., a participant could not choose both
persuading and formal for the same message).3
With enough game players, many messages are
created that clearly reflect different social informa-
tion. Without any of the participants necessarily
2Taboo words were chosen as morphological variants of the
social information type description. For example, persuade,
persuades, persuaded, and persuading were considered taboo
words for ?persuading?. Future versions of the GWAP could
allow the taboo word list to be influenced by which words are
often associated with a particular social information type.
3We note that this is a restriction that might be relaxed in
future versions of the GWAP. For instance, participants might
decide whether a message expresses a social information type
or not from their perspective, so the task is more like binary
classification for each social information type.
having expert knowledge or training, we expect that
the cumulative knowledge to be quite reliable (for
example, see Steyvers et al (2009) and work by von
Ahn (von Ahn and Dabbish 2004, von Ahn 2006,
von Ahn, Kedia, and Blum 2006) for other success-
ful cases involving the ?wisdom of the crowds?, and
Snow et al (2008) for non-expert annotation in nat-
ural language tasks such as affect recognition). Be-
cause the same text can be evaluated by many differ-
ent people, this can reduce the effect of idiosyncratic
responses from a few individuals.
An advantage of this kind of database is that many
different kinds of social information can be gen-
erated and labeled by the participants so that the
database contains examples of many different kinds
of social information in text, even if only a single
label is given to a particular message (perhaps ex-
pressing that message?s most obvious social infor-
mation from the perspective of the labeler). We can
gauge how clearly a message reflects social informa-
tion by how often it is labeled by others as reflect-
ing that social information. In addition, by the very
nature of the GWAP, we can also assess which so-
cial information is easily confused by humans, e.g.,
politeness with embarrassment, or confidence with
deception. This can aid the development of models
that extract social information and could also iden-
tify messages likely to be ambiguous to humans.
2.4 A GWAP study
Below we report data from an offline GWAP that in-
volves eight types of social information indicative of
several social aspects that we thought would be of
interest: politeness (indicates emotional state, atti-
tude), rudeness (indicates emotional state, attitude),
embarrassment (indicates emotional state), formal-
ity (indicates attitude), persuading (indicates intent),
deception (indicates intent), confidence (indicates
emotional state, attitude), and disbelief (indicates
attitude). Fifty eight English-speaking adults par-
ticipated in the GWAP, consisting of a mix of un-
dergraduate students, graduate students, the authors,
friends of the students, and friends of the authors,
in order to simulate the varied mix of participants in
an online GWAP. The undergraduate students were
compensated with course credit. Together, these 58
participants created 1176 messages and made 3198
annotations. Note that a participant would label
73
more messages than that participant would be asked
to generate, and more than one participant would la-
bel the same message (though no participant would
label a message that s/he created, nor would any par-
ticipant label the same message more than once).
Participants were encouraged to play the GWAP
multiple times if they were inclined, to simulate the
experience of playing a favorite game. There was no
limit on message length, though most participants
tended to keep messages fairly brief. Some sample
messages (with the participants? own spelling and
punctuation) that were correctly and incorrectly la-
beled are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Sample messages from the offline GWAP.
The GWAP as currently designed allows us to
gauge two interesting aspects of social information
transmission via text. First, we can assess our non-
expert participants? performance. Second, we can
assess the messages themselves.
For the participants, we can gauge their accuracy
as message generators by measuring how often a
message they created was successfully perceived as
expressing the intended social information type (that
is, their ?expressive accuracy?). On average, mes-
sage generators were able to generate reliable mes-
sages 56% of the time. Figure 1 displays the expres-
sive accuracy of participants, while also showing
how many messages participants generated. Most
participants created less than 30 messages, and were
accurate more than half the time.
Figure 1: Expressive accuracy of GWAP participants.
At the same time, we can also gauge the accu-
racy of the participants as non-expert annotators by
measuring how often a participant perceived the in-
tended social information (that is, their ?perceptive
accuracy?). On average, annotators were able to per-
ceive the intended social information 58% of the
time. Figure 2 displays the perceptive accuracy,
while also showing how many messages partici-
pants annotated. Most participants annotated around
20 messages or between 80 and 100 messages and
were accurate more than half the time. Average
inter-annotator agreement was 0.44, calculated us-
ing Fleiss? Kappa (Fleiss 1971), suggesting moder-
ate agreement.
Figure 2: Perceptive accuracy of GWAP participants.
Turning to the messages, we can gauge how often
messages were able to successfully express a par-
ticular social information type, and how often they
were confused as expressing some other type. Table
2 shows a confusion matrix of social information de-
74
rived from this database.

Table 2: Confusion matrix for the human participants.
The rows represent the intended social information for a
message while the columns represent the labeled social
information, averaged over messages and participants.
The matrix shows the likelihood that a message
will be labeled as expressing specific social infor-
mation (in a column), given that it has been gener-
ated with specific social information in mind (in a
row), averaged over messages and participants. In
other words, we show the probability distribution
p(labeled|generated). The diagonal probabilities
indicate how often a message?s social information
was correctly labeled for each social information
type; this shows how often social information trans-
mission was successful. Messages were perceived
correctly by human participants about 57% of the
time. More particular observations about the data in
Table 2 are that people are more likely to correctly
identify a message expressing rudeness (p = .78)
and confidence (p = .67) and less likely to correctly
identify a message expressing deception (p = .37)
or formality (p = .39). Also, we can see that a
deceptive message can often be mistaken for a per-
suading message (p = 0.20), a formal message mis-
taken for a polite message (p = 0.34), a message
expressing disbelief mistaken for a message express-
ing deception (p = .10), and a persuading message
mistaken for a deceptive message (p = .09) or con-
fidence (p = .12), among other observations. Some
of these may be expected, e.g., confusing confidence
with persuading since someone who is trying to per-
suade will likely be confident about the topic, or
formality with politeness since many formal expres-
sions are used to indicate politeness (e.g., ?if you
would be so kind?). Others may be unexpected a
priori, such as mistaking disbelief for deception.
2.5 Human reliability and message reliability
Given that humans were believed to be good at iden-
tifying social information in text, the low percep-
tive accuracy rates for participants and low anno-
tation accuracy rates for messages may seem unex-
pected. However, we believe it indicates that some
messages are better than others at expressing social
information in a way obvious to humans. That is,
messages confusing to human participants (e.g., the
lower three examples in Table 1, as well as the con-
fusing messages represented by the probabilities in
Table 2) would be consistently mislabeled.
It may be that some messages are created such
that many annotators agree with each other, but they
all perceive a social information type other than the
one intended.4 In a similar vein, messages with
low inter-annotator agreement may simply be poorly
generated messages that should be removed from the
database. To this end, we can assess how often ma-
jority annotator agreement correlates with percep-
tion of the message?s intended social information
type. Table 3 shows the confusion matrix for mes-
sages where over 50% of the annotators agreed with
each other on which social information type was in-
tended, and at least two annotators labeled the mes-
sage. A total of 866 messages satisfied these criteria.
The confusion matrix, as before, shows the like-
lihood that a message will be labeled as express-
ing specific social information (in a column), given
that it has been generated with specific social in-
formation in mind (in a row), averaged over mes-
sages and participants. The diagonal probabilities
indicate how often a message?s social information
was correctly labeled for each social information
type; this shows how often social information trans-
mission was successful. The messages in this sub-
set were perceived correctly by human participants
about 71% of the time, a significant improvement
over 57%. This demonstrates how even a modest
pooling of non-expert opinion can significantly in-
4Messages consistently perceived as expressing a different
social information type than intended should perhaps be con-
sidered as actually expressing that social information type rather
than the intended one.

crease the accuracy of social information identifica-
tion in text.
We can observe similar trends to what we saw in
Table 2, in many cases sharpened from what they
were previously. People are still more likely to iden-
tify messages expressing rudeness (p = .92) and
confidence (p = .82), though they are also now more
likely to accurately identify persuading (p = .82).
The ability to identify politeness (p = .71) and em-
barrassment (p = .69) has also improved, though
a polite message can still be mistaken for a formal
message (p = .13). Formality (p = .46) and de-
ception (p = .45) remain more difficult to iden-
tify, with formal messages mistaken for politeness
(p = .34) and deceptive messages mistaken for per-
suading (p = .21) and rudeness (p=.10) 5. Note,
however, that messages of disbelief and persuad-
ing are now rarely mistaken for deceptive messages
(p = .05 and p = .03, respectively). It is likely
then that the confusions arising in this data set are
more representative of the actual confusion humans
encounter when perceiving these social information
5We note that people?s precision on deceptive messages was
higher: 0.67. That is, when they labeled a message as deceptive,
it was deceptive 2/3 of the time. However, the probabilities in
Table 3 represent deceptive message recall, i.e., how well they
were able to label all deceptive messages as deceptive.
types.
Identifying messages likely to be misperceived by
humans is useful for two reasons. First, from a cog-
nitive standpoint, we can identify what features of
those messages are the source of the confusion if
the messages are consistently misperceived, which
tells us what linguistic cues humans are (mistakenly)
keying into. This then leads to designing better ma-
chine learning algorithms that do not key into those
misleading cues. Second, this aids the design of cog-
nitive systems that predict how a message is likely
to be interpreted by humans, and can warn a human
reader if a message?s intent is likely to be interpreted
incorrectly.
3 Training a classifier with the database
To demonstrate the utility of the created database for
developing computational approaches to social in-
formation identification in text, we applied a Sparse
Multinomial Logistic Regression (SMLR) classifier
(Krishnapuram et al 2005) to the the subset of mes-
sages where two or more participants labeled the
message and more than 50% of the participants per-
ceived the intended social information type. This
subset consisted of 624 messages (these messages
make up the messages in the diagonals of table 3).
While we realize that there are many other machine
learning techniques that could be used, we thought
this classifier would be a reasonable one to start
with to demonstrate the utility of the database. As a
first pass measure for identifying diagnostic linguis-
tic cues, we examined a number of fairly shallow
features:
? unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
? number of word types, word tokens, and sen-
tences
? number of exclamation marks, questions
marks, and punctuation marks
? average sentence and word length
? word type to word token ratio
? average word log frequency for words appear-
ing more than once in the database
76
The use of shallow linguistic features seemed a
reasonable first investigation as prior research in-
volving linguistic cues for identifying information
in text has often used word-level cues. For exam-
ple, positive and negative affect words (e.g., excel-
lent vs. poor) have been used in sentiment analysis
to summarize whether a document is positive or neg-
ative (Turney 2002, Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan
2002, among others). In deception detection re-
search, informative word-level cues include count-
ing first and third person pronoun usage (e.g., me vs.
them) (Anolli, Balconi, and Ciceri 2002), and noting
the number of ?exception words? (e.g., but, except,
without) (Gupta and Skillicorn 2006). In addition,
informative shallow text properties have also been
identified (Zhou et al 2004), such as (a) number of
verbs, words, noun phrases, and sentences, (b) aver-
age sentence and word length, and (c) word type to
word token ratio.
The SMLR classifier model was trained to pro-
duce the label (one of eight) corresponding to the
generated social information using all the text fea-
tures as input. Using a 10-fold cross-validation pro-
cedure, the model was trained on 90% of the mes-
sages and tested on the remaining 10%. The sparse
classifier favors a small number of features in the
regression solution and sets the weight of a large
fraction of features to zero. Some of the non-zero
weights learned by the model for each social infor-
mation type are listed below (though each type has
other features that also had non-zero weights). Posi-
tive weights indicate positive correlations while neg-
ative weights indicate negative correlations. Cues
that are negatively correlated are italicized. Bigrams
and trigrams are indicated by + in between the rele-
vant words (e.g., no+way). BEGIN and END indi-
cate the beginning and the end of the message, re-
spectively.

? persuading: BEGIN+if+you (2.3), buy (1.3),
come (3.5), have+to (1.6), we+can (1.3),
would+look (2.9), you+should (3.4)
Some of the feature-label correlations discovered
by the model fit with our intuitions about the so-
cial information types. For example, deceptive mes-
sages are negatively correlated with some of the
first person pronouns (me, my), in accordance with
Anolli, Balconi, and Ciceri (2002)?s results. Sev-
eral polite and formal words appear correlated with
polite and formal messages respectively (may+i,
nice, so+sorry, would+you+like; BEGIN+excuse,
miss, mr, sir), and formal messages tend not to in-
clude exclamation points. Negative words tend to
be associated with rude messages (annoying, loud,
mean, ugly), while positive words tend to be asso-
ciated with confident messages (really+good, sure,
the+best). Messages conveying disbelief tend to
have more question marks and contain expressions
of surprise (never, no+way, shocked), and persua-
sive messages tend to contain coercive expressions
(come, have+to, you+should). As this is a relatively
small data set, these cues are unlikely to be defini-
tive ? however, it is promising for the approach as a
whole that the classifier can identify these cues using
fairly shallow linguistic analyses.
We can also examine the classifier?s ability to la-
bel messages, given the features it has deemed di-
agnostic for each social information type (i.e., those
features it gave non-zero weight). For each message
77
in the dataset, the classifier predicted what the in-
tended social information type was. A correct pre-
diction for a message?s type matches the intended
type for the message. A confusion matrix for the
classifier based on the messages from the 624 mes-
sage test set is shown in Table 4. Overall, the clas-
sifier was able to correctly label 59% of the mes-
sages. This is 12% less than humans were able to
correctly label, but far better than chance perfor-
mance (13%) and the performance of a simple al-
gorithm that chooses the most frequent data type in
the training set (17%).
The classifier shows some patterns similar to the
human participants: (1) deception and formality are
harder to detect than other social information types,
(2) confidence and embarrassment are easier to de-
tect than other social information types, and (3) for-
mality is often mistaken for politeness (p = .26).
However, some differences from the human partici-
pants are that deception is often mistaken for rude-
ness (p = .19) and politeness is often confused with
rudeness and embarrassment, in addition to formal-
ity (all p = .12).

Table 4: Confusion matrix for the machine learning clas-
sifier. The rows represent the intended social information
for a message while the columns represent the labeled so-
cial information.
As the classifier?s behavior was similar to hu-
man behavior in some cases, and the classifier used
only these shallow linguistic features to make its
decision, this suggests that humans may be key-
ing into some of these shallower linguistic features
when deciding a message?s social information con-
tent. Given this, a classifier trained on such linguis-
tic features may be able to predict which messages
are likely to be ambiguous to humans.
4 Conclusion
We have described a methodology using GWAPs
to create a database containing messages labeled
with social information such as emotions, inten-
tions, and attitudes, which can be valuable to the
information extraction research community. Hav-
ing implemented this methodology on a small scale,
we discovered that non-expert annotators were able
to identify the social information of interest fairly
well when their collective perceptions were com-
bined. However, we also noted that certain social
information types are easily confusable by humans.
We also used the database created by the GWAP
to investigate shallow linguistic cues to social in-
formation in text and attempt to automatically la-
bel messages as expressing particular social infor-
mation. The fact that the social information types
we used in our GWAP can be identified automati-
cally with some success suggests that these social
information types are useful to pursue, though of
course there are many other emotional states, atti-
tudes, and intentions that could be explored in fu-
ture work. In addition, other classifiers, particularly
those using deeper-level properties like phrase struc-
ture, may be able to identify more subtle cues to
social information in text. We also foresee extend-
ing the GWAP methodology to create large-scale
databases both in English and in other languages in
order to continue fostering the development of com-
putational approaches to social information identifi-
cation.
