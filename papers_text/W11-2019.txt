Abstract
User satisfaction is a common evaluation met-
ric in task-oriented dialogue systems, whereas
tutorial dialogue systems are often evaluated
in terms of student learning gain. However,
user satisfaction is also important for such
systems, since it may predict technology ac-
ceptance. We present a detailed satisfaction
questionnaire used in evaluating the BEETLE
II system (REVU-NL), and explore the un-
derlying components of user satisfaction us-
ing factor analysis. We demonstrate interest-
ing patterns of interaction between interpreta-
tion quality, satisfaction and the dialogue pol-
icy, highlighting the importance of more fine-
grained evaluation of user satisfaction.
1 Introduction
User satisfaction is one of the primary evaluation
measures for task-oriented spoken dialogue systems
(SDS): the goal of an SDS is to accomplish the task,
and to keep the user satisfied, so that they will want
to continue using the system. Typically, the PAR-
ADISE methodology (Walker et al, 2000) is used to
establish a performance function which relates user
satisfaction measured through questionnaires to in-
teraction parameters that can be derived from sys-
tem logs. This function can then be used to better
understand which properties of the interaction have
the most impact on the users, and to compare differ-
ent system versions.
In contrast, tutorial dialogue systems are typically
evaluated in terms of student learning gain, by com-
paring student scores on standardized tests before
and after interacting with the system. This is clearly
an important evaluation metric, since it directly as-
sesses the benefit students obtain from using the sys-
tem. However, it is also important to evaluate user
satisfaction, since it can influence students? willing-
ness to use computer tutors in a long run. Thus,
recent studies have looked at factors that could in-
fluence user satisfaction in tutorial dialogue, such as
different tutoring policies (Forbes-Riley and Litman,
2011), quality of speech output (Forbes-Riley et al,
2006), and students? prior attitudes towards technol-
ogy (Jackson et al, 2009).
Assessing user satisfaction, however, is not a
straightforward task. As we discuss in more detail in
Section 2, user satisfaction is known to be a complex
multi-dimensional construct, composed of largely
independent factors such as perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness. Therefore, questionnaires
used for assessing satisfaction need to be validated
through user studies, and different satisfaction di-
mensions should be assessed independently. There-
fore, SDS researchers are now starting to use tech-
niques from psychometrics for this purpose (Hone
and Graham, 2000; Mo?ller et al, 2007). However,
user satisfaction studies tutorial dialogue currently
rely on simple questionnaires adapted from either
task-oriented SDS or non-dialogue intelligent tutor-
ing systems (Michael et al, 2003; Forbes-Riley et
al., 2006; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011; Jackson
et al, 2009), and these questionnaires have not been
validated for tutorial dialogue systems.
In this paper, we make the first step towards de-
veloping a better user satisfaction questionnaire for
tutorial dialogue systems. We present a user satis-
162
faction evaluation of the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue
system. Starting with a detailed user satisfaction
questionnaire, we employ exploratory factor analy-
sis to discover a set of dimensions for the students?
satisfaction with a dialogue-based tutor. We then
use the factors we derived to compare user satisfac-
tion between two versions of our computer tutor that
use different policies for generating the tutor?s feed-
back. We investigate the relationships between the
subjective satisfaction dimensions and the objective
learning gain metric for the two systems. Finally, we
carry out a more detailed investigation of our prior
results on the relationship between user satisfaction
and interpretation quality in tutorial dialogue. Our
analysis also provides insights for further improving
the questionnaire we developed and gives an exam-
ple of how user satisfaction metrics developed for
task-oriented dialogue can be adapted to different
dialogue applications. It also opens new questions
about how different properties of the interaction af-
fect user satisfaction in tutorial dialogue, which can
be investigated in future work.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We
discuss the approaches for assessing user satisfac-
tion with SDS in Section 2. In Section 3 we describe
the BEETLE II tutorial dialogue system used in this
evaluation. We describe our questionnaire design in
Section 4, and describe its use in BEETLE II evalu-
ation in Section 5. We conclude by discussing the
implication of our analysis for tutorial dialogue sys-
tem evaluation in Section 6.
2 Background
A typical approach to assessing user satisfaction in
dialogue systems is collecting user survey data by
asking users to rate their agreement with statements
such as ?the system was easy to use?. In the simplest
case of early PARADISE studies, the questionnaires
contained 5 items assessing different dimensions of
satisfaction, which were then summed to produce a
total satisfaction score.
However, using simple questionnaires has draw-
backs now recognized by the SDS community. First,
if individual questions are expected to assess differ-
ent dimensions of user satisfaction, they need to be
validated first, or else they may be ambiguous and
mean different things to different users. Second,
summing or averaging over questions measuring dif-
ferent satisfaction components may not be the best
approach, since it may conflate unrelated judgments
(Hone and Graham, 2000).
To address this problem, SDS researchers have
started using more complex questionnaires, where
each underlying dimension of user satisfaction is as-
sessed through multiple questions. Factor analysis is
then used to determine which questions are related
to one another (and therefore are likely to be assess-
ing the same underlying satisfaction dimension), and
to discard possibly ambiguous questions. Then, the
PARADISE methodology can be used to relate dif-
ferent interaction parameters to individual compo-
nents of user satisfaction.
Several such studies have been conducted recently
(Hone and Graham, 2000; Larsen, 2003; Mo?ller et
al., 2007; Wolters et al, 2009), covering command-
and-control and information-seeking dialogue. The
questionnaires in those studies contained 25 to 50
items, and factor analyses typically resulted in 6- or
7-factor solutions, with dimensions such as accept-
ability, affect, system response accuracy and cogni-
tive demand. The underlying factors found by those
analyses tend to match up well, but not to over-
lap perfectly. In comparison, all user satisfaction
questionnaires for tutorial dialogue systems that we
are aware of contain 10-15 items which are either
summed up for PARADISE studies, or compared
individually to track system improvement (Michael
et al, 2003; Forbes-Riley et al, 2006; Forbes-Riley
and Litman, 2011; Jackson et al, 2009).
In this paper, we apply the more sophisticated
SDS evaluation methodology to the BEETLE II tu-
torial dialogue system. We devise a more sophis-
ticated user satisfaction questionnaire using SDS
questionnaires for guidance and then apply factor
analysis to investigate the underlying dimensions.
We compare our results to analyses from two pre-
vious studies: SASSI (Hone and Graham, 2000),
which is a validated questionnaire intended for use
with a variety of task-oriented dialogue systems,
and a more recent ?modified SASSI? questionnaire
which is a version of SASSI adapted for use with the
INSPIRE home control system (Mo?ller et al, 2007).
Henceforth we will refer to this as INSPIRE.

3 BEETLE II Tutorial Dialogue System
The goal of BEETLE II (Dzikovska et al, 2010c)
is to teach students conceptual knowledge in the do-
main of basic electricity and electronics. The system
is built on the premise that encouraging students to
explain their answers and to talk about the domain
will lead to improved learning, a finding consistent
with analyses of human-human tutoring in several
domains (Purandare and Litman, 2008; Litman et
al., 2009). BEETLE II has been engineered to test
this hypothesis by eliciting contentful talk through
explanation questions.
The BEETLE II learning material consists of two
self-contained lessons suitable for college-level stu-
dents with no prior knowledge of basic electricity
and electronics. The lessons take 4 to 5 hours to
complete, and consist of reading materials and inter-
active exercises. During the exercises, the students
interact with a circuit simulator, building electrical
circuits containing bulbs, batteries and switches, and
using a multimeter to measure voltage. Then the
tutor asks students to explain circuit behavior, for
example, ?Why was bulb A on when switch Y was
open and switch Z was closed?? In addition, at dif-
ferent points in the lesson the tutor asks ?summary?
questions, asking students to define concepts such
as voltage, and verbalize general patterns such as
?What are the conditions that are required for a bulb
to light??. At present, students use a typed chat in-
terface to communicate with the system.1
We built and evaluated two versions of the sys-
tem (Dzikovska et al, 2010a). The baseline non-
adaptive tutor (BASE) requires students to produce
answers, but does not provide any remediation and
immediately states the correct answer. The fully
adaptive version (FULL) engages in dialogue with
the student, and tailors its feedback to the student?s
answer by confirming its correct parts and giving
hints in order to help students fix missing or incor-
rect parts. The FULL system generates feedback au-
tomatically based on a detailed analysis of the stu-
dent?s input, and is capable of giving hints at differ-
ent levels of specificity depending on the student?s
previous performance.
1A speech interface is being developed, but typed communi-
cation is common in online and distance learning, and therefore
is an acceptable choice for tutorial dialogue as well.
These two system versions were designed to eval-
uate the impact of adaptive feedback (within the lim-
itations of current language interpretation technol-
ogy) on student learning and satisfaction. Our initial
data analysis focused on the differences in student
language depending on the condition (Dzikovska et
al., 2010a), and on the impact of different types of
interpretation errors on learning gain and user sat-
isfaction (Dzikovska et al, 2010b). However, these
initial results were based on an aggregate satisfac-
tion score obtained by averaging over scores for all
questions in our user satisfaction questionnaire. In
this analysis, we take a more detailed look at the dif-
ferent factors that contribute to students satisfaction
with the system, and their relationship with learning
gain and interpretation quality.
4 Data Collection
4.1 Questionnaire Design
To support user satisfaction evaluation we developed
a satisfaction questionnaire, REVU-IT (Report on
the Enjoyment, Value, and Usability of an Intelli-
gent Tutor). It consists of 63 items which cover all
aspects of interaction with the tutoring system: the
clarity and usefulness of the reading material; the
graphical user interface to the circuit simulator; in-
teraction with the dialogue tutor; and the overall im-
pression of the BEETLE II system as a whole. The
reading material, graphical user interface and inter-
action with the tutor sections are complementary,
because they cover separate parts of the BEETLE II
interface. We expect that all of these three compo-
nents contribute to the overall impression score. For
purposes of this paper, we will focus on the part of
the questionnaire that relates to the natural language
interaction with the tutor (REVU-NL), and its re-
lationship to the overall impression score (REVU-
OVERALL).
The REVU-IT questionnaire was developed by
experienced cognitive psychologists (two of the au-
thors of this paper). The REVU-NL section con-
sists of 35 items shown in Appendix A. Its design
was guided by questionnaires used in previous re-
search, including INSPIRE and a questionnaire used
to evaluate the ITSPOKE tutorial dialogue system
(Forbes-Riley et al, 2006). REVU-NL contains a
number of items from these, but omits items that are
164
not relevant to the BEETLE II domain (e.g, ?Domes-
tic devices can be operated efficiently with the sys-
tem? or ?The tutor responded effectively after I was
uncertain?), and adds extra questions related to tu-
toring (e.g., ?Our dialogues quickly led to me hav-
ing a deeper understanding of the material?), based
on the authors? previous experience in human factors
research. We also slightly rephrased all questions to
refer to ?the tutor? rather than ?the system?.
The REVU-OVERALL section of REVU-IT
consists of 5 items assessing the student?s satis-
faction with their learning as a whole. The ques-
tions are: ?Overall, I am satisfied with my experi-
ence learning about electricity from this system.?;
?Working in this learning environment was just like
working one-on-one with a human tutor?; ?I would
have preferred to learn about electricity in a different
way.?; ?I would use this system again in the future to
continue to learn about electricity.?; ?I would like to
be able to use a system like this to learn about other
topics in the future.?. We use the averaged score over
these 5 items to represent the student?s overall satis-
faction with the learning environment, referring to it
as ?overall satisfaction?.
Adding new questions to the REVU-NL ques-
tionnaire on top of already existing questions is the
initial step in addressing the issues discussed in Sec-
tion 2: validating the individual questions and dis-
covering the underlying dimensions of user satis-
faction. Having a large number of questions ask-
ing about the same aspects of the interaction will
allow us to group related questions together into di-
mensions (?factors?), and also to discover ambigu-
ous questions that will need to be improved in future
studies. The detailed discussion of the technique and
issues involved is presented in Hone and Graham
(2000).
4.2 Participants
We used REVU-IT as part of a controlled experi-
ment comparing the BASE and FULL versions of the
system. We recruited 87 participants from a uni-
versity in the Southern US, paid for participation.
Participants had little knowledge of the domain.
Each participant signed consent forms and com-
pleted a pre-test, then worked through both lessons
(with breaks), and then completed a post-test and a
REVU-IT questionnaire. Each session lasted 3.5
hours on average.
Out of 87 participants that completed the study, 13
had an inordinate amount of trouble with interface:
they typed utterances that could not be interpreted
by the tutor (defined as having more than 3 standard
deviations in interpretation errors compared to the
rest), did not follow tutor?s instructions or experi-
enced system crashes. In addition, two participants
were learning gain outliers (again, more than 3 stan-
dard deviations from average). These participants
were removed from the analysis. The questionnaires
from the remaining 72 participants are used in our
data analysis.
5 Analysis
5.1 Underlying satisfaction dimensions
Each item in the REVU-NL questionnaire used a
5-point Likert scale, from ?completely disagree? (1)
to ?fully agree? (5). Most of the items were phrased
so that the agreement with the statement meant a
positive evaluation of the system. For a few items,
however, the polarity was reversed (e.g., ?The tutor
was not helpful?). Those items were reverse-coded,
with 1 meaning ?fully agree? and 5 ?completely dis-
agree?, to ensure that a lower score on all questions
corresponds to a negative assessment.
Following Hone and Graham (2000), we used
exploratory factor analysis to group questionnaire
items into clusters representing different dimen-
sions. One of the standard approaches in determin-
ing how many factors (?question clusters?) to use
is the scree test which checks the number of eigen-
values in the question covariance matrix which are
greater than 1. These typically correspond to prin-
cipal components which reflect the underlying ques-
tionnaire structure. The scree test showed 7 eigen-
values greater than 1, resulting in the 7-factor solu-
tion presented in Table 1.
The loadings in the table are the correlation coef-
ficients between the individual question scores and
the variables representing the factors. Most of the
correlations are quite high, indicating that the ques-
tions are strongly correlated both among themselves
and the underlying factor. However, the last two fac-
tors contain only non-loading questions according to
the criteria in (Hone and Graham, 2000), i.e., ques-
tions for which the correlations are too weak to be
165

reliable. In addition, factors 4 and 5 had fewer than
3 questions. Since the number of subjects in our data
set is small, such factors may not be reliable. There-
fore, we focus our remaining analysis on the top 3
factors from the questionnaire, each of which con-
tains 3 or more questions.
Twelve questions in REVU-NL were ?cross-
loading? according to criteria in Hone and Graham
(2000), that is, their two top loadings differed by
less than 0.2. This indicates questions that are likely
to be ambiguous, since they are strongly correlated
with two (theoretically independent) variables. Such
questions should be refined and re-designed in future
surveys. These were questions t1, t4, t6, t11, t12,
t17, t20, t21, t23, t25, t27, t35 from the appendix.
We removed them from our solution, and discuss the
implications for survey design in Section 6.
The first component in our analysis lines up well
with the Transparency and Cognitive load factors
from INSPIRE, and Response accuracy, Cognitive
demand and Habitability from SASSI, though it was
not split into individual factors as in those analyses.
We will refer to this factor as Transparency. The
second component contains questions specific to tu-
toring. However, it is similar to the Acceptability
dimension from INSPIRE (the original SASSI ques-
tionnaire did not include similar questions), which
asked users to rate statements such as ?domestic de-
vices can be operated efficiently with the system?.
Thus, we will refer to it as Acceptability. Finally,
our third dimension lines up best with the Affect and
Annoyance items from SASSI.2 We will refer to it as
Affect.
Although the correspondences between our fac-
tors and those derived from SASSI and INSPIRE
are not perfect, the fact that similar underlying fac-
tors are derived from different user groups and sys-
tems indicates that they are likely to be measuring
the same underlying constructs.
5.2 Comparing satisfaction in different systems
Recall that in this study we combined the data from
two systems: FULL, where the system provided stu-
dents with adaptive feedback and hints, and BASE,
where the system simply acknowledged the stu-
dent?s answers and then provided a correct answer
without engaging in dialogue. Table 2 separates out
the average factor scores for these two conditions,
where a factor score is computed by averaging over
scores of all questions assigned to that factor.
When comparing learning gain and overall satis-
faction between the two systems (which is the over-
all impression of the system behavior as a whole,
including circuit simulation and lesson design), the
difference is not statistically significant (learning
gain t(69) = ?0.95, p = 0.35, overall satisfac-
tion t(69) = ?1.52, p = 0.13). In contrast, on
individual dimensions related to tutoring the scores
for BASE is significantly higher than the score for
FULL (Transparency, t(69) = ?7.19, p < 0.0001;
Acceptability: t(69) = ?3.24, p < 0.01; Affect:
2The acceptability dimension from INSPIRE is split be-
tween our factors 2 and 3, but most of the questions correspond
to our factor 2 questions.

FULL BASE
Transparency 2.15 (0.56) 3.36 (0.81)
Acceptability 3.11 (1.02) 3.80 (0.77)
Affect 2.43 (0.80) 2.86 (0.996)
Overall 3.39 (0.88) 3.70 (0.83)
Learning gain 0.61 (0.15) 0.65 (0.22)
Table 2: Average scores for different satisfaction dimen-
sions in FULL and BASE (standard deviation in parenthe-
ses)
t(69) = ?1.97, p = 0.05). Comparing the means,
the biggest difference in student ratings shows on the
Transparency scale, while the affective reaction for
the two systems is more similar (though still rated
higher for BASE).
It is somewhat unexpected to see that the students
were equally satisfied overall with both systems but
rated the tutor in BASE more highly than in FULL,
since the tutor behavior was the only thing different
between conditions. We are at present investigating
the reasons for this result. One possibility is that
when students did not get much feedback from the
tutor (as in BASE), other factors became more im-
portant to overall satisfaction, such as course design
and quality of user simulation.
5.3 Relationships between subjective and
objective outcome measures
We investigated the correlations between learning
gain and different user satisfaction factors for the
two system versions. Results are presented in Table
3. As can be seen from the table, learning gain and
user satisfaction are only significantly correlated in
FULL, and only for the acceptability and overall sat-
isfaction factors. None of the factors in the BASE
system correlate with learning gain. This indicates
that the student?s affective reaction to the system is
not necessarily linked directly to its objective bene-
fits. We discuss these results further in Section 6
5.4 Impact of interpretation quality on user
satisfaction
It is generally known in SDS research that measures
of interpretation quality such as word error rate and
concept accuracy are strongly correlated with user

satisfaction (e.g., (Walker et al, 2000; Mo?ller et al,
2007)). Our system uses typed input and produces
complex logical representations (rather than sim-
ple slot-value pairs), thus, these measures cannot be
computed directly. However, in an earlier study we
showed that another measure of interpretation qual-
ity, namely, percentage of utterances that could not
be interpreted by the system (?uninterpretable utter-
ances?) is negatively correlated with learning gain
and user satisfaction (Dzikovska et al, 2010b).3
That study revealed an unexpected pattern. Al-
though the system recorded the number of utter-
ances it could not interpret in both FULL and BASE,
students in BASE were never informed of any in-
terpretation problems. Nevertheless, the proportion
of such uninterpretable utterances was still signifi-
cantly negatively correlated with user satisfaction in
BASE. After analyzing correlations between differ-
ent types of errors and user satisfaction, we hypoth-
esized that this can be explained by the lack of align-
ment between the system and the student, in partic-
ular when students used terminology different from
that used by the system (Dzikovska et al, 2010b).
We can now analyze this relationship in more de-
tail, looking at correlations between interpretation
problems and different components of user satisfac-
tion. The results are presented in Table 4.
As can be seen from the table, the proportion
of uninterpretable answers is significantly correlated
with Acceptability in FULL, but not in BASE. This
is not surprising, indicating that students who were
told that they were not understood perceived the
system as less useful for them. More surprisingly,
Transparency, which is related to perceived ease of

use for the system, was not correlated with uninter-
pretable utterances. Finally, the proportion of unin-
terpretable utterances is significantly correlated with
Affect for both systems. Moreover, the unexpected
negative correlation we observed in the earlier study
between satisfaction with the tutor and interpretation
problems in BASE can be primarily attributed to the
negative correlation with the Affect score.
6 Discussion
In this study, we attempted to apply insights from
studies of user satisfaction in spoken dialogue sys-
tems to a different type of dialogue application: tu-
torial dialogue. We were looking to develop a better
user satisfaction questionnaire for evaluating tutorial
dialogue systems, and to implement an evaluation
methodology which takes into account different un-
derlying dimensions of user satisfaction.
The three dimensions we obtained based on ex-
ploratory factor analysis of REVU-NL align well
with the dimensions reported in the SDS litera-
ture, which provides some evidence of their valid-
ity. However, the results are preliminary because
of the small number of participants involved, and
need to be replicated with additional participants and
different tutoring systems. Regardless, our analysis
highlighted important issues in designing satisfac-
tion surveys for different dialogue genres.
When choosing which questions to include in a
satisfaction questionnaire for a new system type,
SASSI is a very attractive starting point, because
it was validated across multiple SDS in two gen-
res (command and control and information seeking).
This also means that SASSI items are phrased very
generally and therefore easier to adapt. In contrast,
INSPIRE contains a number of questions specific to
the command and control domain, asking whether
the user thinks the system is useful in achieving their
goals (i.e., operating the domestic devices). SASSI
includes only one similar item, ?The system was
useful?. It was classed as Affect, most likely be-
cause there were no other similar items. However,
we think that such questions represent an important
separate dimension, namely the ?perceived useful-
ness? factor known to predict technology acceptance
(Adams et al, 1989). Therefore we included sev-
eral items in REVU-NL with similar intent, asking
whether users thought the system was beneficial to
their goal (i.e., learning the material). These items
were clustered into a separate dimension by factor
analysis, indicating that they should be included in
other satisfaction surveys.
Moreover, some of the questions that appeared
genre-independent to us proved to be cross-loading
in our analysis, which is an indicator of ambiguity.
Apparently, some of the items from task-oriented di-
alogue questionnaires did not transfer well. For ex-
ample, statements like ?The system didn?t always do
what I expected? are unambiguous for task-oriented
dialogue, where the user is supposed to be in control
of the interaction, and therefore has clear expecta-
tions of what the system should do. In contrast, in
tutorial dialogue the tutor has control over the learn-
ing material. Thus, it may be more ambiguous as
to what, if anything, students are expecting from the
interaction.
Overall, our experience shows that it may not
be possible, or indeed useful, to create completely
generic surveys. However, we believe that question-
naires can be phrased generally enough to apply to a
range of systems with similar goals, and REVU-NL
in particular is useful starting point for comparing
dialogue-based tutoring systems. We believe that the
18 questions that we retained as unambiguous in our
analysis provide adequate assessment of user satis-
faction, and are grouped into factors consistent with
results of previous research. However, the question-
naire could be further improved by revisiting the
cross-loading items we rejected as ambiguous, and
seeing if their wording could be improved. We are
also intending to use REVU-IT in evaluating a spo-
ken version of BEETLE II, thus providing additional
validation data on a different version of the interface.
With respect to evaluation methodology, our re-
sults highlight the need to look at different satis-
168
faction dimensions separately. We used our fac-
tors to further investigate a pattern that we discov-
ered in previous research, namely, that students who
speak in a way that is difficult for the system to in-
terpret tend to be less satisfied with the tutor, even
when they are not told of the interpretation prob-
lems. Looking at correlations with individual di-
mensions shows that this relationship is primarily
explained by the Affect dimension. Our working hy-
pothesis is that the lack of alignment between in-
correct student answers and the answers supplied by
the system caused students to perceive the system as
a less likeable or cooperative conversational partner.
We also observed that Acceptability, but no other
dimensions, were correlated with learning gain in
FULL. One possible explanation is that students who
are learning more believe that the system is help-
ing them reach their goals (our definition of Accept-
ability). The FULL condition provides students with
more explicit feedback as to their learning; whereas
in BASE students may have a less accurate estimate
of how well they are doing, and hence no satisfaction
dimensions are correlated with learning gain.
It is worth noting that an earlier study investigat-
ing the relationship between user satisfaction and
learning in two different tutorial dialogue systems
(Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009) found little corre-
lation between the answers to individual questions
on their satisfaction questionnaire and learning gain.
Only one correlation, with the question ?The tutor
helped me to concentrate?, reached significance in
only one of the 4 conditions they investigated. This
adds further evidence that the relationship between
learning gain and satisfaction is not straightforward.
However, our results are difficult to compare since
the questionnaires used are different, and Forbes-
Riley and Litman (2009) are studying correlations
with individual questions rather than grouping re-
lated questions together. Developing better validated
questionnaires will make such results easier to com-
pare and interpret, and we believe that REVU-NL
makes a significant step in that direction.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed an improved question-
naire (REVU-NL) for evaluating user satisfaction
in tutorial dialogue systems, which is an important
evaluation metric alongside learning gain. We used
the methodology from SDS evaluations to investi-
gate different dimensions of user satisfaction, and
their relationship to learning gain and different in-
teraction properties. Next, we are planning to use
the PARADISE methodology to establish predictive
models that relate satisfaction dimensions to mea-
surable interaction properties, so that we can de-
termine development priorities, and make it eas-
ier to compare different system versions. We are
also planning to collect additional questionnaire data
with a speech-enabled version of the system, and
verify our analyses on this extended data set.
