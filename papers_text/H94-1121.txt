PROJECT GOALS 
The goals of the PANGLOSS project are to investigate 
and develop a new-generation k owledge-based interlin- 
gual machine translation system, combining symbolic 
and statistical techniques. The system is to translate 
newspaper texts in arbitrary domains (though a specific 
financial domain is given preference) to as high quality 
as possible using as little human intervention as possible. 
The project involves three sites (USC/ISI, New Mex- 
ico State University, and Carnegie Mellon University). 
NMSU is responsible for Spanish parsing and lexicon 
acquisition; CMU for glossary and example-based MT 
translation, interlingua specification, workstation devel- 
opment, and system integration, and ISI for Japanese 
parsing and analysis, Spanish analysis, English genera- 
tion, Japanese and English lexicon acquisition, and se- 
mantic term lexicon (Ontology) acquisition. 
Within PANGLOSS, it is the particular focus of ISI to 
strive toward large-scale system coverage by investigat- 
ing the feasibility and utility of combined statistical and 
human acquisition techniques of grammars, lexicons, and 
semantic knowledge. To this end, we have acquired sev- 
eral large resources, especially of Japanese lexical infor- 
mation, and are developing methods to integrate this 
knowledge with the ongoing development of Japanese 
parsing and semantic analysis and Ontology term acqui- 
sition and taxonomization. 
RECENT RESULTS 
The most recent ARPA evaluations of several MT sys- 
tems, including PANGLOSS, are not yet available. How- 
ever, preliminary measurements indicate that translators 
performed around 40% more quickly using the system 
than translating manually (for Spanish to English; the 
Japanese ffort is only 6 months old at this time). 
In recent work, we have: 
? continued the construction of the PANGLOSS Ontol- 
ogy, the taxonomy of terms used in the semantic 
interlingua representation (the Ontology now con- 
tains approx. 50,000 items); 
? acquired and deployed the lexical analyzer JU- 
MAN and the parser SAX, with their accompanying 
130,000-item wordlist; 
? acquired a bilingual Japanese-English dictionary of 
approx. 70,000 entries and fully decoded its con- 
tents; 
? acquired several other Japanese lexicons of various 
sizes and amounts of information; 
? developed algorithms for linking Japanese lexical 
items to the Ontology; 
? developed an English lexicon for our Penman sen- 
tence generator that contains approx. 70,000 items; 
? developed several mappers that convert he output 
of one module of PANGLOSS into the input of an- 
other (all these mappers employ the same bottom- 
up unification-based chart parser); 
? developed a collection of 200,000 statistically-based 
rules that govern the inclusion of the articles "the" 
and "a" into English text without articles (which is 
how it would come from Japanese). 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Our major efforts for the next year fall in four areas: 
1. Japanese parsing, analysis, and lexis: the continued 
extension and testing of the current systems and 
lexicons; 
2. Spanish semantic analysis: the development of the 
current mapper from the NMSU parser output to 
interlingua form into a more powerful and robust 
semantic mapper; 
3. Ontology enrichment: he extraction of concept fea- 
tures and interrelationships from online resources 
and text, and their inclusion into the Ontology; 
4. Sentence planning and English generation: the en- 
hancement of the current interlingua-to-Penman 
mapper into a true Sentence Planner and the con- 
tinued extension of the Penman generator.
