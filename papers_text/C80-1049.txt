Abstract 
Computer softwares for processing 
Thai language are developed at National 
Museum of Ethnology,Osaka,Japan. We use 
a popular intell igent terminal TEKTRONIX 
4051 for inputting and edit ing,IBM 370 
model 138 for KWIC making and sorting, 
and CANON's laser beam printer for final 
output. 
Using these systems,"Kotmai Tra Sam 
Duang"(the Three Seals Law)which con- 
tains many kind of laws and ordinances 
proclaimed in Thai between 1350-1805 
A.D. is computerized. This text has 1700 
pages and about 1400000 letters. KWIC 
index becomes 200000 lines. 
Some statistical data for this text 
are obtained. They are occurrence fre- 
quency data of single letter,group vowel, 
and letter combination(digram),etc. 
Aknowledgements

their support on making Thai letter 
patterns and output software for laser 
beam printer. 
Introduction 
In the field of ethnology or cul- 
tural anthlopology,ethnographies are 
very important information sources for 
comparative study of many different 
societies. Not only bibl iographic data 
but also contents of text are necessary. 
HRAF(Human Relations Area Files), 
which was developed by Dr. Murdock and 
now managed by HRAF Inc. at Yale Univer- 
sity,is a unique retrieval system. 
They use about 800 category codes by 
which analysts classify the contents of 
each pages of books. 
Though HRAF system is an elaborate 
work,it is not easy to search necessary 
data by user terms,that is,natural words. 
If whole text are fed into computer,it 
is very easy to retrieve any part of 
text by the same natural words used in 
the text. 
On-line retrieval system is smart 
and effective. But sometimes researcher 
wants printted index like as KWIC which 
is usable at any time and place. Com- 
bining KWIC index and thesaurus diction- 
ary,it gives us a very powerful tools 
for searching special expression hidden 
in the text. 
Till quite recentry,at least in 
Japan,most cases of computer processing 
of natural language are distored to 
indo-europian language or Japanese. In 
the ethnological studies,we must treat 
many areas in the world. We need comput- 
er softwares which process unfamiliar 
languages for us,such as Arabic,Korean, 
Sumerian,Mongol ian,Devanagari ,Thai,etc.  
National Museum of Ethnology at 
Osaka has introduced several computer 
systems to encourage humanity study,and 
now is developing many application 
softwares which are usable by any re- 
searchers who do not know computer pro- 
gramming or how to use computer. 
This report describes one of such 
application softwares which treats Thai 
letters. The points of our work are as 
follows; 
i) A popular computer terminal is used 
for Thai letter inputting and editing. 
It is easy to use because dead key oper- 
ation is not necessary. 
2) KWIC making and sorting software are 
implemented using FORTRAN language which 
can be transfered to any other computer 
system. The algorithm is not so complex 
but it was not implemented only because 
they are not popular language. 
3) Statistical data of the text are ob- 
tained. They are occurrence frequency 
of single letter,group vowel,and letter 
combination. These data will help us as 
a contexial data in case of OCR.

Seqmentation 
There is no segmentation problems 
in case of indo-europian languages,be- 
cause they have clear separator for word 
unit such as space or comma. There are, 
however, many languages in Asia which 
have no clear separator. They are Korean 
(Hangul),Chinese,Japanese,and Thai,etc. 
Examples shown below mean that there 
exist several different segmentation. 
Segmentation affects to the meaning of 
sentence and retrieval efficiency.

Fig.l Examples of different segmentations 
To cut into long unit is effort 
saving, but it is diff icult to search 
the string included in that unit. To 
cut into short unit is effective for 
searching, but too many keywords appear. 
The text, the Three Seals Law, has 
no word separator, as shown in fig.3. 
So it is necessary to segment into ap- 
propriate units before making KWIC index. 
But it is diff icult problem because 
segmentation needs well understanding 
of meaning, which conversely needs KWIC 
index. 
We adopted a practical method which 
at first cut into long unit and then 
cut again after looking KWIC index.

Inputting 
Terminal 
We use a popular intell igent graph- 
ic terminal TEKTRONIX 4051 which has 
usual alphabet keyboard. We sticked Thai 
letter labels on the side of each key as 
if it looks like Thai typewriter. A code 
table of Thai letters and coresponding 
english alphabets is shown in Table i. 
The characteristics of this termi- 
nal are; 
i) It generates Thai letter pattern by 
BASIC program in graphic mode. User can 
affirm the letter he typed. 
2) It has local cassett memory, so that 
user can input and edit data anytime, 
even when host computer is not working. 
3) By way of communication line, stored 
data can be transmitted to host computer 
for time consuming work. 
4) It is easy to implement a flexible 
Thai language editor, which accept al- 
phabet commands and display Thai letters. 
5) Copy of screen can be taken by the 
hard copy unit attached to it. 
Rules for text inputting 
The text has many irregular expres- 
sions. So following expediencies are a- 
dopted. 
i) Quotated words or phrases from Pali 
language are skipped by inserting spe- 
cial symbol to indicate there are 
skipped words.

3)Special expressions for money,dating, 
and fractional number are transformed 
into sentence form. 
4)Vertical expression shown in Fig.3 are 
attached special symbol after and before 
the word. 
5)Parallel expression in the middle of 
l ine,and tree like expression are trans- 
formed into linear form from which ori- 
ginal form can be reconstructable as 
much as possible. 
Order of input 
The order of input of Thai letters 
to the computer is same with the order 
in which one would strike keys of type- 
writer.

KWIC making 
The most  obvious compl icat ion  is 
the fact that in Thai wr i t ing  as many as 
three separate characters  can appear at 
the same hol izonta l  pos i t ion  in four 
d i f ferent  vert ica l  posit ions.  Therefore 
number of letters to take as before or 
after context  must  be carefu ly  counted. 
As a index of every un i t ,vo lume 
number ,page number and line number are 
at tached to the left side. 
Sort ing 
Sort ing a lgor i thm of Thai words is 
not so s imple as Engl ish.  
l hai 
Computer  a lgor i thm 
i) Every occurrence of p re -pos i t ioned 
vowel ( & ~ I ~  ) is moved to a posi-  
t ion immediate ly  -following consonant  it 
preceeds.  
2) D iacr i t ic  symbols are moved to the 
end of word with the ind icat ion of posi -  
t ion counted from the end of word. 
3) Each letter is rep laced by the code 
given in Table i. 
4) Then two words are compared as if 
they are numerals.

We ignored a lgor ism 2) ,because our 
segmentat ion units are not necessar i ly  
words so that it does not work effec- 
t ively.

Printing 
~Age\[ bgampr in ter  
CANON LBP-3500 is a laser beam 
printer which can print out any kind of 
figure and characters. In a character 
mode,character must be defined as a dot 
matrix of 8X8,16Xi6,24X24,32X32,etc. 
We use 16X16 matrix as a minimum 
module of Thai letter pattern. Thai 
characters are classif ied into fifteen 
types from the size of dot matrix. The 
largest pattern has 48X32 matrix which 
uses 6 modules. 
One text line is printed by five 
horizontal zone. Each zone has 16 dot 
vertical width. The horizontal width of 
each letter can be changed character by 
character. But in a same zone,vertical 
size can not be changed. 
Control of dif ferent letter w id th  
The complex part of output program 
is to control the width so that heading 
part of KWIC index come in a line verti-
