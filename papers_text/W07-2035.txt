Abstract 
We have participated in the Multilingual 
Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of 
SemEval-2007. Our system disambiguates 
senses of Chinese words and finds the 
correct translation in English by using the 
web as WSD knowledge source. Since all 
the statistic data is obtained from search 
engine, the method is considered to be 
unsupervised and does not require any 
sense-tagged corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Due to the lack of sense tagged corpora (and the 
difficulty of manually creating them), the 
unsupervised method tries to avoid, or at least to 
reduce, the knowledge acquisition problem, which 
the supervised methods have to deal with. In order 
to tackle the problem of the knowledge acquisition 
bottleneck, we adopted an unsupervised approach 
based on search engine, which does not require any 
sense tagged corpus. 
The majority of methods using the Web often try 
to automatically generate sense tagged corpora 
(Agirre and Martinez 2000;Agirre and Martinez 
2004;Gonzalo et al 2003; Mihalcea and Moldovan 
1999;Santamaria et al 2003). In this paper, we 
experiment with our initial attempt on another 
research trend that uses the Web not for extracting 
training samples but helping disambiguate directly 
during the translation selection process. 
The approach we present here is inspired by 
(Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso 
et al 2005; Dagan et al 2006; McCarthy 2002). 
Suppose that source ambiguous words are apt to 
appear with its target translation on bilingual web 
pages either parallel or non-parallel. Instead of 
searching the source language or target language 
respectively on web, we try to let the search engine 
think in a bilingual style. First, our system gets the 
co-occurrence information of Chinese context and 
its corresponding English context. Then it computes 
association measurements of Chinese context and 
English context in 4 kinds of way. Finally, it 
selects the correct English translation by 
computing the association measurements. 
In view that this is the first international standard 
evaluation to predict the correct English translation 
for ambiguous Chinese word, we built HIT-WSD 
system as our first attempt on disambiguation by using 
bilingual web search and just want to testify validity 
of our method. 
2 HIT-WSD System 
2.1 Disambiguation Process 
HIT-WSD system disambiguates senses of Chinese 
target ambiguous word and finds the correct 
translation in English by searching bilingual 
information on the web. Figure 1 gives the 
flowchart of our proposed approach. Given an 
ambiguous word with a Chinese sentence, we 
easily create its Chinese context. English context 
can be acquired from a Chinese-English dictionary and 
the translation mapping set(offered by the 
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample 
Task). System puts Chinese context and English 
context as queries on search engine individually 
and collectively. After this step, frequency and co-
occurrence frequency of Chinese context and English 
 
169
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
context will be found. Finally, our system selects the 
most probable English translation by computing 
association measurements. 
Figure 2 gives an example of how the proposed 
approach selects English translations of the 
Chinese ambiguous word ???/dongyao? given 
the sentence and its translation mapping set. This 
instance comes from the training data of Multilin-
gual Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of Sem-
eval2007. According to the translation mapping set,  
Chinese target word ??? /dongyao? has two 
English Translations: shake and vacillate.  
English Context Candidates set is the 
translations set of the Chinese context. System uses 
translation mapping set to translate Chinese target 
ambiguous word and uses an Chinese-English 
dictionary to translate other words in Chinese 
context. English Context Candidates set could be 
any combination of translations and each 
combination could be selected as the English context. 
 After getting the Chinese context and English 
context, we put them as queries to search engine 
and extract page counts (which can be considered 
as frequency) which search engine returned.  We 
not only search Chinese context and English 
context individually, but also put them together to 
search engine.  
Association measurements: the Dice coefficient, 
point-wise mutual information, Log Likelihood 
score and? P2 P score are computed in the third phase 
while we got all kinds of statistic results from 
search engine. Finally, we determine the 
translation by simply computing the association 
measurements

2.2  Experiment Settings 
Although the Chinese context can be represented 
with local features, topic features, parts of speech 
and so on, we use sentence segment as Chinese 
context in our experiment system. The sentence 
segment is a window size ? n segment of the 
sentence including the ambiguous words. 
English Context Candidates set could be any 
combination of the translation of words appearing 
in Chinese context. In our experiment system, we 
just choose the translation of the Chinese target 
ambiguous words in the translation mapping set as 
English context. 
We choose googleTP 1 PT and baiduTP 2 PT as our search 
engine, for they are both most widely used for 
English and Chinese language respectively.  
Putting Chinese context and English context as 
queries to the search engine, we will get 
corresponding page counts it returned as figure 2 
shows. 
Four statistical measurements were used in order 
to measure the degree of association of Chinese 
Context (CC) and English Context (EC). CC and 
EC can be seen as two random events occuring in 
the web pages: 
 
1. Point-wise mutual information:

We applied our method to the training data of 
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task. 
The results are as showed in Table 1. 
Since only one test result can be uploaded for 
one system, our system selects the settings of one 
of the best results. The final settings of our system 
is: window size is [-1, +2], the search engine is 
baidu and the association measurement is Point-
wise mutual information. 
3 Official Results 
In multilingual Chinese-English lexical sample 
task of SemEval-2007, there are 2686 instances in 
training data for 40 Chinese ambiguous words. All 
these ambiguous words are either nouns or verbs. 
Test data consist of 935 untagged instances of the 
same target words. 
The official result of our system in multilingual 
Chinese-English lexical sample task is reported as 
in Table 2.

4 Conclusions 
In SemEval-2007, we participated in Multilingual 
Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task with a fully 
unsupervised system based on bilingual web search. 
Our initial experiment result shows that our system 
fails to reach MFS (Most Familiar Sense) baseline 
due to our method is too simple where search 
queries are formed (just uses simple context 
window and English target translation). Our 
approach is the first attempt so far as we know on 
using bilingual web search for translation selection 
directly. The system is very simple but seemed to 
achieve a not bad performance when considered 
the performance of fully unsupervised systems in 
SENSEVAL-2, SENSEVAL -3 English tasks. 
For future research, we will investigate the 
dependency of bilingual documents, optimize the 
search queries, filter out potential noises and 
combine the different results in order to devise an 
improved method that can utilize bilingual web 
search better.
