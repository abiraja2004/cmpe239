Abstract
While automatic metrics of translation qual-
ity are invaluable for machine translation re-
search, deeper understanding of translation
errors require more focused evaluations de-
signed to target specific aspects of translation
quality. We show that Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) can be used to evaluate the
quality of machine translation lexical choice,
by applying a standard phrase-based SMT sys-
tem on the SemEval2010 Cross-Lingual WSD
task. This case study reveals that the SMT
system does not perform as well as a WSD
system trained on the exact same parallel data,
and that local context models based on source
phrases and target n-grams are much weaker
representations of context than the simple
templates used by the WSD system.
1 Introduction
Much research has focused on automatically eval-
uating the quality of Machine Translation (MT) by
comparing automatic translations to human transla-
tions on samples of a few thousand sentences. Many
metrics (Papineni et al, 2002; Banerjee and Lavie,
2005; Gime?nez and Ma?rquez, 2007; Lo and Wu,
2011, for instance) have been proposed to estimate
the adequacy and fluency of machine translation and
evaluated based on their correlatation with human
judgements of translation quality (Callison-Burch et
al., 2010). While these metrics have proven in-
valuable in driving progress in MT research, finer-
grained evaluations of translation quality are neces-
sary to provide a more focused analysis of transla-
tion errors. When developing complex MT systems,
comparing BLEU or TER scores is not sufficient to
understand what improved or what went wrong. Er-
ror analysis can of course be done manually (Vilar
et al, 2006), but it is often too slow and expensive
to be performed as often as needed during system
development.
Several metrics have been recently proposed to
evaluate specific aspects of translation quality such
as word order (Birch et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2012).
While word order is indirectly taken into account by
BLEU, TER or METEOR scores, dedicated metrics
provide a direct evaluation that lets us understand
whether a given system?s reordering performance
improved during system development. Word order
metrics provide a complementary tool for targeting
evaluation and analysis to a specific aspect of ma-
chine translation quality.
There has not been as much work on evaluating
the lexical choice performance of MT: does a MT
system preserve the meaning of words in transla-
tion? This is of course measured indirectly by com-
monly used global metrics, but a more focused eval-
uation can help us gain a better understanding of the
behavior of MT systems.
In this paper, we show that MT lexical choice can
be framed and evaluated as a standard Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) task. We leverage exist-
ing WSD shared tasks in order to evaluate whether
word meaning is preserved in translation. Let us em-
phasize that, just like reordering metrics, our WSD
evaluation is meant to complement global metrics of
translation quality. In previous work, intrinsic eval-
uations of lexical choice have been performed us-
ing either semi-automatically constructed data sets
1
based on MT reference translations (Gime?nez and
Ma`rquez, 2008; Carpuat and Wu, 2008), or man-
ually constructed word sense disambiguation test
beds that do not exactly match MT lexical choice
(Carpuat and Wu, 2005). We will show how ex-
isting Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation
tasks (Lefever and Hoste, 2010; Lefever and Hoste,
2013) can be directly seen as machine translation
lexical choice (Section 2): their sense inventory is
based on translations in a second language rather
than arbitrary sense representations used in other
WSD tasks (Carpuat and Wu, 2005); unlike in MT
evaluation settings, human annotators can more eas-
ily provide a complete representation of all correct
meanings of a word. Second, we show how us-
ing this task for evaluating the lexical choice perfor-
mance of several phrase-based SMT systems (PB-
SMT) gives some insights into their strengths and
weaknesses (Section 5).
2 Selecting a Word Sense Disambiguation
Task to Evaluate MT Lexical Choice
Word Sense Disambiguation consists in determining
the correct sense of a word in context. This chal-
lenging problem has been studied from a rich variety
of persectives in Natural Language Processing (see
Agirre and Edmonds (2006) for an overview.) The
Senseval and SemEval series of evaluations (Ed-
monds and Cotton, 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds,
2004; Agirre et al, 2007) have driven the standard-
ization of methodology for evaluating WSD sys-
tems. Many shared tasks were organized over the
years, providing evaluation settings that vary along
several dimensions, including:
? target vocabulary: in all word tasks, systems
are expected to tag all content words in run-
ning text (Palmer et al, 2001), while in lexical
sample tasks, the evaluation considers a smaller
predefined set of target words (Mihalcea et al,
2004; Lefever and Hoste, 2010).
? language: English is by far the most studied
language, but the disambiguation of words in
other languages such as Chinese (Jin et al,
2007) has been considered.
? sense inventory: many tasks use WordNet
senses (Fellbaum, 1998), but other sense repre-
sentations have been used, including alternate
semantic databases such as HowNet (Dong,
1998), or lexicalizations in one or more lan-
guages (Chklovski et al, 2004).
The Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation
(CLWSD) task introduced at a recent edition of Se-
mEval (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) is an English lex-
ical sample task that uses translations in other Eu-
ropean languages as a sense inventory. As a result,
it is particularly well suited to evaluating machine
translation lexical choice.
2.1 Translations as Word Sense
Representations
The CLWSD task is essentially the same task as
MT lexical choice: given English target words in
context, systems are asked to predict translations in
other European languages. The gold standard con-
sists of translations proposed by several bilingual
humans, as can be seen in Table 1. MT system
predictions can be compared to human annotations
directly, without introducing additional sources of
ambiguity and mismatches due to representation dif-
ferences. This contrasts with our previous work on
evaluating MT on a WSD task (Carpuat and Wu,
2005), which used text annotated with abstract sense
categories from the HowNet knowledge base (Dong,
1998). In HowNet, each word is defined using a
concept, constructed as a combination of basic units
of meaning, called sememes. Words that share the
same concept can be viewed as synonyms. Evaluat-
ing MT using a gold standard of HowNet categories
requires to map translations from the MT output to
the HowNet representation. Some categories are an-
notated with English translations, but additional ef-
fort is required in order to cover all translation can-
didates produced by the MT system.
2.2 Controlled Learning Conditions
Another advantage of the CLWSD task is that it pro-
vides controlled learning conditions (even though it
is an unsupervised task with no annotated training
data.) The gold labels for CLWSD are learned from
parallel corpora. As a result MT lexical choice mod-
els can be estimated on the exact same data. Trans-
lations for English words in the lexical sample are
extracted from a semi-automatic word alignment of

sentences from the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn,
2005). These translations are then manually clus-
tered into senses. When constructing the gold an-
notation, human annotators are given occurrences of
target words in context. For each occurrence, they
select a sense cluster and provide all translations
from this cluster that are correct in this specific con-
text. Since three annotators contribute, each test oc-
currence is therefore tagged with a set of translations
in another language, along with a frequency which
represents the number of annotators who selected it.
A more detailed description of the annotation pro-
cess can be found in (Lefever and Hoste, 2010).
Again, this contrasts with our previous work on
evaluating MT on a HowNet-based Chinese WSD
task, where Chinese sentences were manually anno-
tated with HowNet senses which were completely
unrelated to the parallel corpus used for training the
SMT system. Using CLWSD as an evaluation of MT
lexical choice solves this issue and provides con-
trolled learning conditions.
2.3 CLWSD evaluates the semantic adequacy
of MT lexical choice
A key challenge in MT evaluation lies in decid-
ing whether the meaning of the translation is cor-
rect when it does not exactly match the reference
translation. METEOR uses WordNet synonyms and
learned paraphrases tables (Denkowski and Lavie,
2010). MEANT uses vector-space based lexical
similarity scores (Lo et al, 2012). While these
methods lead to higher correlations with human
judgements on average, they are not ideal for a
fine-grained evaluation of lexical choice: similar-
ity scores are defined independently of context and
might give credit to incorrect translations (Carpuat et
al., 2012). In contrast, CLWSD solves this difficult
problem by providing all correct translation candi-
dates in context according to several human anno-
tators. These multiple translations provide a more
complete representation of the correct meaning of
each occurrence of a word in context.
The CLWSD annotation procedure is designed
to easily let human annotators provide many cor-
rect translation alternatives for a word. Producing
many correct annotations for a complete sentence is
a much more expensive undertaking: crowdsourc-
ing can help alleviate the cost of obtaining a small
number of reference translation (Zbib et al, 2012),
but acquiring a complete representation of all pos-
sible translations of a source sentence is a much
more complex task (Dreyer and Marcu, 2012). Ma-
chine translation evaluations typically use between
one and four reference translations, which provide
a very incomplete representation of the correct se-
mantics of the input sentence in the output language.
CLWSD provides a more complete representation
through the multiple gold translations available.
2.4 Limitations
The main drawback of using CLWSD to evaluate
lexical choice is that CLWSD is a lexical sample
task, which only evaluates disambiguation of 20 En-
glish nouns. This arbitrary sample of words does not
let us target words or phrases that might be specifi-
cally interesting for MT.
In addition, the data available through the shared
task does not let us evaluate complete translations
of the CLWSD test sentences, since full references
translations are not available. Instead of using
3
a WSD dataset for MT purposes, we could take
the converse approach andautomatically construct
a WSD test set based on MT evaluation corpora
(Vickrey et al, 2005; Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2008;
Carpuat and Wu, 2008; Carpuat et al, 2012). How-
ever, this approach suffers from noisy automatic
alignments between source and reference, as well as
from a limited representation of the correct mean-
ing of words in context due to the limited number of
reference translations.
Other SemEval tasks such as the Cross-Lingual
Lexical Substitution Task (Mihalcea et al, 2010)
would also provide an appropriate test bed. We
focused on the CLWSD task, since it uses senses
drawn from the Europarl parallel corpus, and there-
fore offers more constrained settings for comparison
between systems. The lexical substitution task tar-
gets verbs and adjectives in addition to nouns, and
would therefore be an interesting test case to con-
sider in future work.
2.5 Official and MT-centric Evaluation Metrics
In order to make comparison with other systems pos-
sible, we follow the standard evaluation framework
defined for the task and score the output of all our
systems using four different metrics, computed us-
ing the scoring tool made available by the organiz-
ers.
The difference between system predictions and
gold standard annotations are quantified using pre-
cision and recall scores1 , defined as follows. Given
a set T of test items and a set H of annotators, Hi is
the set of translation proposed by all annotators h for
instance i ? T . Each translation type res in Hi has
an associated frequency freqres, which represents
the number of human annotators which selected res
as one of their top 3 translations. Given a set of sys-
tem answers A of items i ? T such that the system
provides at least one answer, ai : i ? A is is the set
of answers from the system for instance i. For each
i, the scorer computes the intersection of the system
answers ai and the gold standard Hi.
Systems propose as many answers as deemed nec-

given sentence. As a result, we only focus on the 1-best MT
output and do not report the relaxed out-of-five evaluation set-

essary, but the scores are divided by the number of
guesses in order not to favor systems that output
many answers per instance.

We also report Mode Precision and Mode Recall
scores: instead of comparing system answers to the
full set of gold standard translations Hi for an in-
stance i ? T , the Mode Precision and Recall scores
only use a single gold translation, which is the trans-
lation chosen most frequently by the human annota-
tors.
In addition, we compute the 1-gram precision
component of the BLEU score (Papineni et al,
2002), denoted as BLEU1 in the result tables2. In
contrast with the official CLWSD evaluation scores
described above, BLEU1 gives equal weight to all
translation candidates, which can be seen as multi-
ple references.
3 PBSMT system
We use a typical phrase-based SMT system trained
for English-to-Spanish translation. Its application
to the CLWSD task affects the selection of training
data and its preprocessing, but the SMT model de-
sign and learning strategies are exactly the same as
for conventional translation tasks.
3.1 Model
We use the NRC?s PORTAGE phrase-based SMT
system, which implements a standard phrasal beam-
search decoder with cube pruning. Translation hy-
potheses are scored according to the following fea-
tures:
? 4 phrase-table scores: phrasal translation prob-
abilites with Kneser-Ney smoothing and Zens-
Ney lexical smoothing in both translation direc-
tions (Chen et al, 2011)
? 6 hierarchical lexicalized reordering scores,
which represent the orientation of the current
phrase with respect to the previous block that
could have been translated as a single phrase
(Galley and Manning, 2008)
2even though it does not include the length penalty used in
the BLEU score.
4
? a word penalty, which scores the length of the
output sentence
? a word-displacement distortion penalty
? a Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram Spanish lan-
guage model
Weights for these features are learned using a batch
version of the MIRA algorithm(Cherry and Foster,
2012). Phrase pairs are extracted from IBM4 align-
ments obtained with GIZA++(Och and Ney, 2003).
We learn phrase translation candidates for phrases of
length 1 to 7.
Converting the PBSMT output for CLWSD re-
quires a final straightforward mapping step. We
use the phrasal alignment between SMT input and
output to isolate the translation candidates for the
CLWSD target word. When it maps to a multi-
word phrase in the target language, we use the word
within the phrase that has the highest translation
IBM1 translation probability given the CLWSD tar-
get word of interest. Note that there is no need to
perform any manual mapping between SMT output
and sense inventories as in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).
3.2 Data
The core training corpus is the exact same set of
sentences from Europarl that were used to learn
the sense inventory, in order to ensure that PBSMT
knows the same translations as the human annotators
who built the gold standard. There are about 900k
sentence pairs, since only 1-to1 alignments that ex-
ist in all the languages considered in CLWSD were
used (Lefever and Hoste, 2010).
We exploit additional corpora from the
WMT2012 translation task, using the full Eu-
roparl corpus to train language models, and for one
experiment the news-commentary parallel corpus
(see Section 9.)
These parallel corpora are used to learn the trans-
lation, reordering and language models. The log-
linear feature weights are learned on a development
set of 3000 sentences sampled from the WMT2012
development test sets. They are selected based on
their distance to the CLWSD trial and test sentences
(Moore and Lewis, 2010).
We tokenize and lemmatize all English and
Spanish text using the FreeLing tools (Padro? and
Stanilovsky, 2012). We use lemma representations
to perform translation, since the CLWSD targets and
translations are lemmatized.
4 WSD system
4.1 Model
We also train a dedicated WSD system for this task
in order to perform a controlled comparison with the
SMT system. Many WSD systems have been eval-
uated on the SemEval test bed used here, however,
they differ in terms of resources used, training data
and preprocessing pipelines. In order to control for
these parameters, we build a WSD system trained
on the exact same training corpus, preprocessing and
word alignment as the SMT system described above.
We cast WSD as a generic ranking problem with
linear models. Given a word in context x, translation
candidates t are ranked according to the following
model: f(x, t) =
?
i ?i?i(x, t), where ?i(x, t) rep-
resent binary features that fire when specific clues
are observed in a context x.
Context clues are based on standard feature tem-
plates in many supervised WSD approaches (Flo-
rian et al, 2002; van Gompel, 2010; Lefever et al,
2011):
? words in a window of 2 words around the dis-
ambiguation target.
? part-of-speech tags in a window of 2 words
around the disambiguation target
? bag-of-word context: all nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives in the context x
At training time, each example (x, t) is assigned
a cost based on the translation observed in parallel
corpora: f(x, t) = 0 if t = taligned, f(x, t) = 1 oth-
erwise . Feature weights ?i can be learned in many
ways. We optimize logistic loss using stochastic gra-
dient descent3.
4.2 Data
The training instances for the supervised WSD sys-
tem are built automatically by (1) extracting all oc-
currences of English target words in context, and (2)
annotating them with their aligned Spanish lemma.

We obtain a total of 33139 training instances for all
targets (an average of 1656 per target, with a mini-
mum of 30 and a maximum of 5414). Note that this
process does not require any manual annotation.
5 WSD systems can outperform PBSMT
Table 2 summarizes the main results. PBSMT out-
performs the most frequent sense baseline by a wide
margin, and interestingly also yields better results
than many of the dedicated WSD systems that par-
ticipated in the SemEval task. However, PBSMT
performance does not match that of the most fre-
quent sense oracle (which uses sense frequencies ob-
served in the test set rather than training set). The
WSD system trained on the same word-aligned par-
allel corpus as the PBSMT system achieves the best
performance. It also obtains better results than all
but the top system in the official results (Lefever and
Hoste, 2010).
The results in Table 2 are quite different from
those reported by Carpuat and Wu (2005) on a Chi-
nese WSD task. The Chinese-English PBSMT sys-
tem performed much worse than any of the dedi-
cated WSD systems on that task. While our WSD
system outperforms PBSMT on the CLWSD task
too, the difference is not as large, and the PBSMT
system is competitive when compared to the full set
of systems that were evaluated on this task. This
confirms that the CLWSD task represents a more fair
benchmark for comparing PBSMT with WSD sys-
tems.
6 Impact of PBSMT Context Models
What is the impact of PBSMT context models
on lexical choice accuracy? Table 3 provides an
overview of experiments where we vary the context
size available to the PBSMT system. The main PB-

Table 3: Impact of source and target context models
on PBSMT performance
SMT system in the top row uses the default settings
presented in Section 3.
In the first set of experiments, we evaluate the
impact of the source side context on CLWSD per-
formance. Phrasal translations represent the core
of PBSMT systems: they capture collocational con-
text in the source language, and they are therefore
are less ambiguous than single words (Koehn and
Knight, 2003; Koehn et al, 2003). The default
PBSMT learns translations for sources phrases of
length ranging from 1 to 7 words.
Limiting the PBSMT system to translate shorter
phrases (Rows l = 1 and l = 3 in Table 3) surpris-
ingly improves CLWSD performance, even though
it degrades BLEU score on WMT test sets. The
source context captured by longer phrases therefore
does not provide the right disambiguating informa-
tion in this context.
In the second set of experiments, we evaluate the
impact of the context size in the target language, by
varying the size of the n-gram language model used.
The default PBSMT system used a 5-gram language
model. Reducing the n-gram order to 3, 2, 1 and in-
creasing it to 7 both degrade performance. Shorter
n-grams do not provide enough disambiguating con-
text, while longer n-grams are more sparse and per-
haps do not generalize well outside of the training
corpus.
Finally, we report a last experiment which uses a
bilingual language model to enrich the context rep-
resentation in PBSMT (Niehues et al, 2011). This
language model is estimated on word pairs formed

Table 4: Impact of reordering models: lexicalized
reodering does not hurt lexical choice only when hi-
erarchical models are used
by target words augmented with their aligned source
words. We use a 4-gram model, trained using Good-
Turing discounting. This only results in small im-
provements (< 0.1) over the standard PBSMT sys-
tem, and remains far below the performance of the
dedicated WSD system.
These results show that source phrases are weak
representations of context for the purpose of lexical
choice. Target n?gram context is more useful than
source phrasal context, which can surprisingly harm
lexical choice accuracy.
7 Impact of PBSMT Reordering Models
While the phrase-table is the core of PBSMT sys-
tem, the reordering model used in our system is
heavily lexicalized. In this section, we evaluate its
impact on CLWSD performance. The standard PB-
SMT system uses a hierarchical lexicalized reorder-
ing model (Galley and Manning, 2008) in addition to
the distance-based distortion limit. Unlike lexical-
ized reordering(Koehn et al, 2007), which models
the orientation of a phrase with respect to the pre-
vious phrase, hierarchical reordering models define
the orientation of a phrase with respect to the previ-
ous block that could have been translated as a single
phrase.
In Table 4, we show that lexicalized reordering
model benefit CLWSD performance, and that the hi-
erarchical model performs slightly better than the
non-hierarchical overall.
8 Impact of phrase translation selection
In this section, we consider the impact of various
methods for selecting phrase translations on the lex-
ical choice performance of PBSMT.
First, we investigate the impact of limiting the
number of translation candidates considered for

each source phrase in the phrase-table. The main
PBSMT system uses t = 50 translation candidates
per source phrase. Limiting that number to 20 and
increasing it to 100 both have a very small impact on
CLWSD.
Second, we prune the phrase-table using a sta-
tistical significance test to measure (Johnson et al,
2007). This pruning strategy aims to drastically de-
crease the size of the phrase-table without degrading
translation performance by removing noisy phrase
pairs.
9 Impact of training corpus
Since increasing the amount of training data is a re-
liable way to improve translation performance, we
evaluate the impact of training the PBSMT system
on more than the Europarl data used for controlled
comparison with WSD. We increase the parallel
training corpus with the WMT-12 News Commen-
tary parallel data 4. This yields an additional training
set of roughly160k sentence pairs. We build linear
mixture models to combine translation, reordering
and language models learned on Europarl and News
Commentary corpora (Foster and Kuhn, 2007). As
can be seen in Table 6, this approach improves all
CLWSD scores except for 1-gram precision. The
decrease in 1-gram precision indicates that the addi-
tion of the news corpus introduces new translation
candidates that differ from those used in the gold in-
ventory. Interestingly, the additional data is not suf-
ficient to match the performance of the WSD system
learned on Europarl only (see Table 2). While ad-
ditional data should be used when available, richer
context features are valuable to make the most of
existing data.

10 Conclusion
We use a SemEval Cross-Lingual WSD task to
evaluate the lexical choice performance of a typi-
cal phrase-based SMT system. Unlike conventional
WSD task that rely on abstract sense inventories
rather than translations, cross-lingual WSD provides
a fair setting for comparing SMT with dedicated
WSD systems. Unlike conventional evaluations of
machine translation quality, the cross-lingual WSD
task lets us isolate a specific aspect of translation
quality and show how it is affected by different com-
ponents of the phrase-based SMT system.
Unlike in previous evaluations on conventional
WSD tasks (Carpuat and Wu, 2005), phrase-based
SMT performance is on par with many dedicated
WSD systems. However, the phrase-based SMT
system does not perform as well as a WSD sys-
tem trained on the exact same parallel data. Anal-
ysis shows that while many SMT components can
potentially have an impact on SMT lexical choice,
CLWSD accuracy is most affected by the length of
source phrases and order of target n-gram language
models. Using shorter source phrases actually im-
proves lexical choice accuracy. The official results
for the CLWSD task at SemEval 2013 evaluation
provide further insights (Lefever and Hoste, 2013):
our PBSMT system can achieve top precision as
measured using the top prediction as in this paper,
but does not perform as well as other submitted sys-
tems when taking into account the top 5 predictions
(Carpuat, 2013). This suggests that local context
models based on source phrases and target n-grams
are much weaker representations of context than the
simple templates used by WSD systems, and that
even strong PBSMT systems can benefit from con-
text models developed for WSD.
New learning algorithms (Chiang et al, 2009;
Cherry and Foster, 2012, for instance) finally make
it possible for PBSMT to reliably learn from many
more features than the typical system used here.
Evaluations such as the CLWSD task will provide
useful tools for analyzing the impact of these fea-
tures on lexical choice and inform feature design in
increasingly large and complex systems.
