Abstract
We describe the submission from the
Columbia Arabic & Dialect Modeling
group (CADIM) for the Shared Task at
the Fourth Workshop on Statistical Pars-
ing of Morphologically Rich Languages
(SPMRL?2013). We participate in the
Arabic Dependency parsing task for pre-
dicted POS tags and features. Our system
is based on Marton et al (2013).
1 Introduction
In this paper, we discuss the system that the
Columbia Arabic & Dialect Modeling group
(CADIM) submitted to the 2013 Shared Task on
Parsing Morphologically Rich Languages (Seddah
et al, 2013). We used a system for Arabic depen-
dency parsing which we had previously developed,
but retrained it on the training data splits used in this
task. We only participated in the Arabic dependency
parsing track, and in it, only optimized for predicted
(non-gold) POS tags and features.
We first summarize our previous work (Sec-
tion 2). We then discuss our submission and the re-
sults (Section 3).
2 Approach
In this section, we summarize Marton et al (2013).
We first present some background information on
Arabic morphology and then discuss our method-
ology and main results. We present our best per-
forming set of features, which we also use in our
SPMRL?2013 submission.
2.1 Background
Morphology interacts with syntax in two ways:
agreement and assignment. In agreement, there is
coordination between the morphological features of
two words in a sentence based on their syntactic
configuration (e.g., subject-verb or noun-adjective
agreement in GENDER and/or NUMBER). In as-
signment, specific morphological feature values are
assigned in certain syntactic configurations (e.g.,
CASE assignment for the subject or direct object of
a verb).
The choice of optimal linguistic features for
a parser depends on three factors: relevance,
redundancy and accuracy. A feature has rel-
evance if it is useful in making an attach-
ment (or labeling) decision. A particular fea-
ture may or may not be relevant to parsing.
For example, the GENDER feature may help
parse the Arabic phrase

not constrain any syntactic decision.2 Even if rele-
vant, a feature may not necessarily contribute to op-
timal performance since it may be redundant with
other features that surpass it in relevance. For ex-
ample, the DET and STATE features alone both help
parsing because they help identify the idafa con-
struction (the modificiation of a nominal by a gen-
itive noun phrase), but they are redundant with each
other and the DET feature is more helpful since it
also helps with adjectival modification of nouns. Fi-
nally, the accuracy of automatically predicting the
feature values (ratio of correct predictions out of all
predictions) of course affects the value of a feature
on unseen text. Even if relevant and non-redundant,
a feature may be hard to predict with sufficient ac-
curacy by current technology, in which case it will
be of little or no help for parsing, even if helpful
when its gold values are provided. The CASE fea-
ture is very relevant and not redundant, but it cannot
be predicted with high accuracy and overall it is not
useful.
Different languages vary with respect to which
features may be most helpful given various tradeoffs
among these three factors. It has been shown pre-
viously that if the relevant morphological features
in assignment configurations can be recognized well
enough, then they contribute to parsing accuracy.
For example, modeling CASE in Czech improves
Czech parsing (Collins et al, 1999): CASE is rele-
vant, not redundant, and can be predicted with suf-
ficient accuracy. However, it had been more diffi-
cult showing that agreement morphology helps pars-
ing, with negative results for dependency parsing in
several languages (Nivre et al, 2008; Eryigit et al,
2008; Nivre, 2009). In contrast to these negative re-
sults, Marton et al (2013) showed positive results
for using agreement morphology for Arabic.
2.2 Methodology
In Marton et al (2013), we investigated morphologi-
cal features for dependency parsing of Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA). The goal was to find a set of rel-
evant, accurate and non-redundant features. We used
both the MaltParser (Nivre, 2008) and the Easy-First
2For more information on Arabic morphology in the con-
text of natural language processing see Habash (2010). For a
detailed analysis of morpho-syntactic agreement, see Alkuhlani
and Habash (2011).
Parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010). Since the
Easy-First Parser performed better, we use it in all
experiments reported in this paper.
For MSA, the space of possible morphological
features is quite large. We determined which mor-
phological features help by performing a search
through the feature space. In order to do this, we
separated part-of-speech (POS) from the morpho-
logical features. We defined a core set of 12 POS
features, and then explored combinations of mor-
phological features in addition to this POS tagset.
This core set of POS tags is similar to those pro-
posed in cross-lingual work (Rambow et al, 2006;
Petrov et al, 2012). We performed this search inde-
pendently for Gold input features and predicted in-
put features. We used our MADA+TOKAN system
(Habash and Rambow, 2005; Habash et al, 2009;
Habash et al, 2012) for the prediction. As the Easy-
First Parser predicts links separately before labels,
we first optimized for unlabeled attachment score,
and then optimized the Easy-First Parser labeler for
label score.
As had been found in previous results, assignment
features, specifically CASE and STATE, are very
helpful in MSA. However, in MSA this is true only
under gold conditions: since CASE is rarely explicit
in the typically undiacritized written MSA, it has a
dismal accuracy rate, which makes it useless when
used in machine-predicted (real, non-gold) condi-
tion. In contrast with previous results, we showed
that agreement features are quite helpful in both gold
and predicted conditions. This is likely a result of
MSA having a rich agreement system, covering both
verb-subject and noun-adjective relations.
Additionally, almost all work to date in MSA
morphological analysis and part-of-speech (POS)
tagging has concentrated on the morphemic form of
the words. However, often the functional morphol-
ogy (which is relevant to agreement, and relates to
the meaning of the word) is at odds with the ?sur-
face? (form-based) morphology; a well-known ex-
ample of this are the ?broken? (irregular) plurals
of nominals, which often have singular-form mor-
phemes but are in fact plurals and show plural agree-
ment if the referent is rational. In Marton et al
(2013), we showed that by modeling the functional
morphology rather than the form-based morphology,
we obtain a further increase in parsing performance

We also showed that for parsing with predicted
POS and morphological features, training on a com-
bination of gold and predicted POS and morpholog-
ical feature values outperforms the alternative train-
ing scenarios.
2.3 Best Performing Feature Set
The best performing set of features on non-gold in-
put, obtained in Marton et al (2013), are shown in
Table 1. The features are clustered into three types.
? First is part-of-speech, represented using a
?core? 12-tag set.
? Second are the inflectional morphological fea-
tures: determiner clitic, person and functional
gender and number.
? Third are the rationality (humanness) feature,
which participates in morphosyntactic agree-
ment in Arabic (Alkuhlani and Habash, 2011),
and a form of the lemma, which abstract over
all inflectional morphology.
For the training corpus, we use a combination of
the gold and predicted features.

3 Our Submission
3.1 Data Preparation
The data split used in the shared task is different
from the data split we used in (Marton et al, 2013),
so we retrained our models on the new splits (Diab
et al, 2013). The data released for the Shared Task
showed inconsistent availability of lemmas across
gold and predicted input, so we used the ALMOR
analyzer (Habash, 2007) with the SAMA databases
(Graff et al, 2009) to determine a lemma given the
word form and the provided (gold or predicted) POS
tags. In addition to the lemmas, the ALMOR an-
alyzer also provides morphological features in the
feature-value representation our approach requires.
Finally, we ran our existing converter (Alkuhlani
and Habash, 2012) over this representation to obtain
functional number and gender, as well as the ratio-
nality feature.3 For simplicity reasons, we used the
MLE:W2+CATiB model (Alkuhlani and Habash,
2012), which was the best performing model on seen
words, as opposed to the combination system that
used a syntactic component with better results on
unseen words. We did not perform Alif or Ya nor-
malization on the data.
We trained two models: one on 5,000 sentences
of training data and one on the entire training data.
3.2 Results
Our performance in the Shared Task for Arabic De-
pendency, Gold Tokenization, Predicted Tags, is
shown in Table 2. Our performance in the Shared
Task for Arabic Dependency, Predicted Tokeniza-
tion, Predicted Tags, is shown in Table 3. For
predicted tokenization, only the IMS/Szeged sys-
tem which uses system combination (Run 2) out-
performed our parser on all measures; our parser
performed better than all other single-parser sys-
tems. For gold tokenization, our system is the sec-
ond best single-parser system after the IMS/Szeged
single system (Run 1). For gold tokenization and
predicted morphology (Table 2), we also give the
performance reported in our previous work (Mar-
ton et al, 2013). The increase over the previously

reported work may simply be due to the different
split for training and test, but it may also be due
to improvements to the functional feature prediction
(Alkuhlani and Habash, 2012), and the predicted
features provided by the Shared Task organizers.
