ABSTRACT 
This paper presents speech recognition test results from the BBN 
BYBLOS system on the Feb 91 DARPA benchmarks in both the 
Resource Management (RM) and the Air Travel Information System 
(ATIS) domains. In the RM test, we report on speaker-independent 
(SI) recognition performance for the standard training condition using 
109 speakers and for our recently proposed SI model made from only 
12 training speakers. Surprisingly, the 12-speaker model performs as 
well as the one made from 109 speakers. Also within the RM do- 
main, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art SI models perform poorly 
for speakers with strong dialects. But we show that this degradation 
can be overcome by using speaker adaptation from multiple-reference 
speakers. For the ATIS benchmarks, we ran a new system conligu- 
ration which first produced a rank-ordered list of the N--best word- 
sequence hypotheses. The list of hypotheses was then reordered using 
more detailed acoustic and language models. In the ATIS bench- 
marks, we report SI recognition results on two conditions. The first 
is a baseline condition using only training data available from NIST 
on CD-ROM and a word-based statistical hi-gram grammar developed 
at MIT/Lincoln. In the second condition, we added training data from 
speakers collected at BBN and used a 4-gram class grammar. These 
changes reduced the word error ate by 25%. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper will present new test results for running the BBN 
BYBLOS system on the speech recognition benchmarks in both the 
Resource Management (RM) and the Air Travel Information System 
(ATIS) domains. 
During this reporting period we have conceentrated on speaker- 
independent recognition conditions. However, we will also report a 
new result demonstrating the need and usefulness of speaker adap- 
tation in order to be able to recognize the speech of speakers with 
different dialects than those found in the training data. 
For the RM corpus, we report on three conditions: 
1. The common SI-109 training condition that has been widely 
reported in the past. 
2. The new SI-12 training paradigm that we introduced at the 
previous DARPA workshop. 
3. Adaptation to the dialect of the speaker 
The ATIS domain presents a new type of speech recognition prob- 
lem in several respects. First of all, and most importantly, the speech 
was collected uring simulations of actual use of the ATIS system. 
The speakers were completely uncoached, and therefore, the range of 
speech phenomena goes far beyond that of the carefully controlled 
read-speech onditions that exist in the RM corpus. We will describe 
our recent efforts to deal with these new problems. 
Since understanding s the ultimate goal of the ATIS domain, we 
use a rank ordered list of the N-best speech recognition hypotheses 
as the interface to the natural language component of BBN's spoken 
language system. Below, we desoribe a new procedure which allows 
the system to use powerful but eomputationally prohibitive acoustic 
models and statistical grammars to reorder the hypotheses in the N-  
best lisL 
For the ATIS corpus, we report on two conditions: 
1. A baseline control condition using a standard training set, lex- 
icon, and M-gram grammar. 
2. An augmented condition using additional training, acoustic mod- 
els for nun-speech p enomena, nd a 4-gram class grammar. 
In the next section, we describe the main features of the baseline 
Byblos system used in both RM and ATIS tests. Next, the RM results 
are presented. For the ATIS domain, we first describe the speech cor- 
pus used. Then we describe the informal baseline training condition 
which was developed to provide informative controlled experiments 
for this domain. Next, we explain how the Byblos system was modi- 
fied for this evaluation. Finally, we describe our augmented condition 
and present comparative r sults. 
BYBLOS SYSTEM DESCRIPTIOPN 
The BBN BYBLOS system had the following notable character- 
istics for the Feb 91 evaluation: 
? Speech was represented by45 spectral features: 14 cepstra nd 
their 1st and 2nd diffe~nces, plus normalized energy and its 
1st and 2rid difference. 
? The HMM observation densities were modeled by tied Gaussian 
matures. The mixture components were defined by K-means 
clustering and remained fixed during training. 
? Context-dependent phonetic HMMs were constructed from tri- 
phone, left-diphone, right-diphone, and phoneme contexts and 
included cross-word-boundary contexts. The individual context 
models were trained jointly in forward-backward. 
77 
? Cooocurrence smoothing matrices were estimated from the tri- 
phone contexts only and then were applied to all HMM obser- 
vation densities. 
? C~nder-dependent models were used for SI recognition. Each 
test sentence was decoded on both models and the final answer 
was chosen automatically by picking the one with the higher 
probability. 
? For all SI results other than the 109 RM condition, SI models 
were created by combining multiple, independently-trained and 
smoothed, speaker-dependent (SD) models. For the SI 109 
condition, however, the training data was simply pooled before 
training. 
This baseline system is the same for both RM and ATIS results re- 
ported below. 
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT RESULTS 
SI Recognition with 109 Training Speakers 
At the June 90 DARPA workshop, we reported our first result 
on the standard 109 SI training condition of 6.5% word error on the 
Feb 89 SI test set using the word-pair grammar. When we retest 
with the current system the en~r ate is reduced to 4.2%. For these 
two tests, the system differed in three ways. First, we augmented 
the signal representation with vectors of second--order differences for 
both the cepstral and energy features. Secondly, the discrete observa- 
tion densities of the phonetic HMMs were generalized tomixtures of 
Gaussians that were tied across all states of all models, as in \[2\], \[5\]. 
The VQ input to the trainer preserved the 5 most probable mixture 
components for each speech frame. In the earlier system, only the 
input to the decoder was modeled as a mixture of Ganssians. To date, 
we have not found any improvement for re-estimating the parameters 
of the mixture components within forward--backward. Finally, in the 
newer system, we trained separate codebooks and HMMs for male 
and female talkers and selected the appropriate model automatically. 
We observed a small additive improvement for each of these three 
changes to the system. 
For the current Feb 91 evaluation, we ran our latest system on 
the standard 109 SI training condition with both no-grammar and the 
word--pair-grammar. Results for these runs are shown in the first 
two rows of table 1 below.

SI Recognition with 12 Training Speakers 
Since it is often difficult and expensive to obtain speech from 
hundreds of speakers for a new domain, we recently proposed \[71 
creating SI models from a much smaller number of speakers but 
using more speech from each speaker. To test the proposal, we ran 
an experiment using 600 utterances from each of the 12 speakers in 
the SD segment of the RM corpus. 
12 speakers could hardly be expected to cover all speaker types 
in the general population (including both genders), so we anticipated 
that smoothing would be needed to make the models robust for new 
speakers. Our usual technique for smoothing across the bins of the 
discrete densities, triphone cooceurrence smoothing \[10\], has proven 
? to be an effective method for dealing with the widely varying amounts 
of training data for the detailed context-dependent models in the By- 
blos system. This technique estimates the probability of any pair of 
discrete spectra ceooecurring in a density by counting over all the den- 
sities of the triphone HMMs. These probabilities are organized into 
a set of phoneme--dependent co fusion matrices which are then used 
to smooth all the densities in the system. 
The data from each training speaker is kept separate through 
forward--backward (Baum-Welch) training and cooccurrenee smooth- 
ing. The individually trained SD HMMs are then combined by av- 
eraging their parameters. We have found that this approach leads 
to better SI performance from a small number of training speakers 
than the usual practice of pooling of all the data prior to training and 
smoothing. 
In table 1, we show that he model made from 12 training speakers 
performs as well as the standard 109 speakers on the Feb 91 SI test set. 
This is better than we had expected based on our previous experience 
with the Feb 89 SI test set. To get a better estimate of the relative 
performance of the two approaches, we tested the current system on 
three evaluation test sets (Feb 89, Oct 89, Feb 91). Averaging the 
results for these 30 test speakers, the SI 109 model achieved 3.9% 
word error while the SI 12 model got 4.5%. This is a very small 
degradation for nearly a 10-fold decrease in the number of training 
speakers. 
Adaptation to Dialect 
We found that our current state-of-the-art (SI) models perform 
poorly when a test speaker's characteristics differ markedly from 
those of the Ixaining speakers. The speaker differences which cause 
poor recognition are not well understood, but outliers of this sort 
are not a rare phenomenom. Our SI models have difficulty with 
the RM test speaker RKM, for instance, a native speaker of English 
with an African-American dialect. Moreover, non-native speakers 
of American English nearly always suffer significantly degraded SI 
performance. 
The problem was made obvious in a pilot experiment we per- 
formed recently. As noted above, our baseline SI performance is 
currently about 4% word error using the standard 109 training speak- 
ers and word-pair grammar. But when we tested four non-native 
speakers of American English under the same conditions, the word 
error rates ranged from 22% to 45%, as shown in table 2.

The table also shows the native language of each speaker and 
the number of years that each has spoken English as their tnSmary 
language. Even though they vary widely in their experience with 
78 
English (and in their subjective intelligibility), each of them suffered 
severely degraded SI performance. Even native speakers of British 
English are subject to this degradation, asthe result from speaker SA 
demonstrates. Furthermore, the result from speaker JM shows that 
this problem does not disappear even after many years of fluency in 
a second language. 
We then tried to adapt he training models to the new dialects by 
estimating a probabilistic speOral mapping between each of the train- 
ing speakers and the test speaker as described in \[7\]. The resulting 
set of adapted models are combined to obtain a single adapted model 
for the test speaker. In this experiment, we used the 12 SD speakers 
from the RM corpus as training speakers. Each test speaker provided 
40 utterances for adaptation and 50 additional ones for testing. The 
word error rates after adaptation are also shown in table 2. The over- 
all average word error rate after speaker adaptation is 5 times better 
than SI recognition for these speakersl 
The success of speaker adaptation i restoring most of the per- 
formance degradation is quite surprising iven that no examples of 
these dialects are included in the training data Fmlbermore, only 
spectral and phonetic differences are modeled by our speaker adap- 
tation procedure. No lexical variations were modeled irectly; we 
used a single speaker-independent phonetic dictionary of American 
English pronunciations. These results how that systematic spectral 
and phonetic differences between speakers can account for most of 
the differences in the speech of native and non-native speakers of a 
language. 
THE ATIS CORPUS 
Corpus Descr ipt ion 
The ATIS corpus consists of severai different ypes of speech 
data, collected in different ways. First, there are approximately 900 
utterances that were collected uring a "Wizard" simulation of an 
actual ATIS system. The subjects were trying to perform aparticular 
task using the system. This data was collected from 31 speakers. 
The data from five of the speakers was used for the test of the natural 
language systems prior to the June 1990 meeting. These have since 
been designated asthe development test speech. Thus, there remained 
774 spontaneous training sentences from 26 speakers. 
In addition to the spontaneous sentences, everal of the subjects 
read cleaned up versions of their spontaneous queries. Finally, 10 
subjects each read 300 sentences during a single 1-hour session. The 
first 100 sentences were read by all the subjects. The next 200 were 
chosen at random from a list of 2800 sentences constructed by BBN 
and SRI, by generalizing from previously recorded sentences from 
several sites. The average total duration of the 300 sentences was 
about 18.5 minutes per speaker (counting only the parts of the utter- 
ances containing speech). 
The 774 sentences from a total of about 30 speakers i clearly not 
sufficient for creating a powerful speaker-independent speech model. 
Collecting speech from an additional 70 speakers would require a 
large additional effort. Therefore, the additional 3000 sentences read 
by the 10 speakers provided the most efficient source of speech for 
estimating a speaker-independent model. 
ATIS Training Speech Characteristics 
The subjects were instructed topush a button (push-to-talk) before 
speaking. However, frequently, they pushed the button quite a while 
before they began speaking. In many cases, they breathed irectly 
on the microphone windscreen, which was apparently placed irectly 
in front of the mouth and nose. Therefore, many files contain long 
periods of silance with interspersed noises. In fact, only 55% of 
the total duration of the training data contains peech (for both the 
read and spontaneous data). In addition, some subjects paused in the 
middle of a sentence for several seconds while thinking about what 
to say next. Others made side comments to themselves or others 
while the microphone was live. All of these effets are included in 
the speech data, thus making it much more difficult to recognize than 
previously distributed da~a~ 
In the RaM corpus, there was a concerted effort to use subjects 
from several dialectal regions. In addition, since the speakers were 
reading, they tended toward standard General American. Thus, the 
models generated from this speech were reasonably robust for native 
speakers of American English. In contrast, he ATIS corpus consisted 
primarily of speakers from the South (26 of 31 speakers were labeled 
South Midland or Southern). 
In order to estimate speech models, we need an accurate tran- 
scription of what is contained in each speech file. This transcription 
usually is in the form of the string of words contained in each sen- 
tence. However, since this was spontaneous speech, there were often 
nonspeech sounds and long periods of silence included among the 
words. Most of these ffects were marked for the spontaneous speech. 
Unfortunately, the transcriptions distributed with the read speech did 
not follow the usual conventions for the stxing of words. A signif- 
icant amount of work was required to correct hese inconsistencies. 
This work was undertaken by BBN and NIST, and was thoroughly 
checked by Lincoln. When all the corrections had been made, they 
were redistributed to the community. 
Definition of Common Baseline 
The new ATIS task presents everal new problems for speech 
recognition. Therefore, itwill be essential to try many new algorithms 
for dealing with it. These experiments wiLl deal with a wide variety 
of topics, including the makeup of the training data, the vocabulary, 
and the grammar. However, it is just as important with this domain, 
as it was with the RM domain, that we use well-founded controlled 
experiments across the different sites. Without a baseline, meaningful 
comparisons between techniques cannot be made. It is necessary in
order for researchers atother sites to be able to determine whether 
a new technique has actually made a significant improvment over 
previous techniques. 
Since no common evaluation condition has been specified by the 
speech performance evaluation committee, BBN and IV\[IT/Lincoln 
have defined, promoted, and distributed an ATIS control condition 
to provide a common reference baseline. This baseline condition 
consists of a common lexicon, training set, and statistical grammar. 
In order to provide auseful baseline condition, all of the standardized 
data should represent a reasonable approximation to current state-of- 
the-art conditions. BBN and Lincoln undertook to define such a 
baseline condition, under the severe constraints of limited available 
data and time. 
Training Set We defined as the baseline training set, all of the 
speech that had been distributed by NIST on CD-ROM excepting the 
spontaneous speech spoken by the speakers used for the June 1990 
test of ATIS. This test consisted of 138 sentences spoken by a total of 
5 speakers, Cod, bf, bm, bp, bw). While an additional 435 sentences 
79 
that been recorded at SRI were made available on tapes at a later 
date, we felt that the small amount of additional speech and the late 
date did not warrant including the speech in the baseline conditon. 
Of course the data was available to all who wanted to use it in any 
other experimental or evaluation condition. 
Vocabulary One of the variables in designing a real speech sys- 
tem is to specify the recognition vocabulary. Given that we do not  
know what words will be included in the test speech, we have to make 
our best attempt to include those words that would seem reasonably 
likely. Of course, ff we include too many words, the perplexity of 
the grammar will inerease, and the recognition error rate will in- 
crease. We felt that, for a baseline condition, the vocabulary must 
be kept fixed, since we wanted to avoid random differences between 
sites due to correctly guessing which words would occur in the test. 
We decided, at BBN to define a standard vocabulary based on the 
transcriptions of all of the designated training data. Thus, all of the 
words included in the Standard Normal Orthographic Representation 
(SNOR) were included in the dictionary. We made sure that many 
fixed sets of words, such as the days, months, and numbers were 
complete. In addition, we filled out many open class word categories 
based on the specific ATIS database that was being used. This in- 
eluded plurals and possessive forms of words wherever appropriate. 
This included names of airlines, plane types, fare codes, credit cards, 
etc. When we did this completely, the result was a vocabulary of over 
1700 words, most of which seemed quite unlikely. Therefore, we ap- 
plied an additional constraint on new open class words. We added to 
the vocabulary only the names of all of the airlines and plane types, 
etc., that served the 10 cities whose flights were included the current 
database. In total, we added about 350 words to the vocabulary actu- 
ally used in the training speech. This brought the baseline vocabulary 
up to 1067 words. The result, when measured on the development 
set, was that the number of words in the test that were not in the 
vocabulary was decreased from 13 to 4. 
Grammar While the definition of the grammar to be used in 
speech recognition is certainly a topic of research, it is necessary 
to have a baseline grammar with which any new grammars may be 
compared. It is also essential that this standard grammar be rela- 
tively easy for most sites to implement, in order that this not be an 
impediment to the use of the baseline condition. Therefore, Lincoln 
estimated the parameters of a statistical bigram grammar using the 
back-off technique developed by IBM \[6\]. The derivation of this 
grammar is described in more detail in \[9\]. The transcriptions used 
to estimate this grammar included those of all of the speech in the 
designated training set (SNOR transcriptions only) and also used the 
435 transcriptions for the new SRI set. The parameters of this model 
were distributed in simple text format so that all sites could use it  
easily. The grammar has a test set perplexity of 17 when measured 
on the development test set. Thus, it provided a low upper bound for 
comparison with any new language models. 
BBN SPEECH TECHNIQUES USED FOR ATIS 
In this section we describe the techniques that we used in the 
ATIS speech recognition evaluation. In particular, we only discuss 
those techniques that differed from those used for RM. The techniques 
include: 
1. Speech/silence d tection. 
2. N-Best recognition and rescoring with detailed models. 
3. Optimization. 
Each of these techniques will be described below. 
Speech/Si lence Detect ion 
As described in a previous section, both the training and test 
speech contained large regions of silence mixed with extraneous noises. 
While the HMM training and recognition algorithms are capable of 
dealing with a certain amount of silence and background noise, they 
not very good at dealing with large periods of silence with occa- 
sional noise. Therefore, we applied a speech end-point detector as a 
preprocess to the training and recognition programs. We found that 
this improved the ability of the training algorithms to concentrate on 
modeling the speech, and of the recognition programs to recognize 
sentences. 
N-Best Recognition 
Since the purpose of the speech recognition is to understand the 
sentences, we needed to integrate it with the natural anguage (NL) 
component of the BBN HARC spoken language understanding sys- 
tem. For this we use the N-Best recognition paradigm \[3\]. The basic 
steps aae enumerated bdow: 
1. Find N-Best hypotheses using non-cross-word models and bi- 
gram grammar 
2. For each hypothesis: 
(a) rescore acoustics with cross-word models 
(b) score word stxing with a more powerful statistical gram- 
mar 
3. Combine scores and reorder hypotheses 
4. Report highest scoring answer as speech recognition result 
5. Feed ordered list to NL 
For efficiency, we use the Word-Dependent N-Best algorithm \[11 \]. 
In addition to providing an efficient and convenient interface between 
speech and NL, the N-Best paradigm also provides an efficient means 
for applying more expensive speech knowledge sources. For example, 
while the use of cross-word triphone models reduces the error rate by 
a substantial factor, it  greatly increases the storage and computation 
of recognition. In addition, a trigram or higher order language model 
would immensely increase the storage and computa~on of a recog- 
nition algorithm. However, given the N-Best hypotheses obtained 
using non-cross-word triphone models, and a bigrarn grammar, each 
hypothesis can be reseored with any knowledge source desired. Then, 
the resulting hypotheses can be reordered. The top scoring answer is 
then the speech ~eognition result. The entire list is then sent to the 
NL component, which chooses the highest answer that it can interpret. 
By using the N-Best paradigm we have found it efficient o ap- 
ply more expensive knowledge sources (as a post process) than we 
could have considered previously. Other examples of such knowledge 
sources include: Stochastic Segment Models \[8\] or Segment Neural 
Networks \[ 1 \]. 
Opt imizat ion  
We usually run the recognition several times on development test 
data in order to find the optimal values for a few system parameters, 
such as the insertion penalty, and the relative weight for the gram- 
mar and acoustic scores. This is a very slow and inexact process. 
However, given the N-Best paradigm, it is a simple matter to find 
80 
the values that maximize recognition accuracy. Briefly, we generate 
several hypotheses for each utterance. For each hypothesis, we factor 
the total score into a weighted combination of the acoustic score(s), 
the language model score, and the insertion penalty. Then, we search 
for the values of the the weights that optimize some measure of cor- 
rectness over a corpus. This technique is described more fully in 
\[81. 
ATIS BBN AUGMENTED CONDITION 
We decided to consider three different conditions beyond those 
specified in the common baseline condition. These include: 
1. Use of additional training speech 
2. Inclusion of explicit nonspeech models 
3. More powerful statistical grammars 
Additional t ra in ing  speech 
One of the easiest ways to improve the accuracy of a recognition 
system is to train it on a Larger amount of speech, from a representative 
sample of the population that will use it. Since there was clearly not 
time to record speech from a very large number of speakers, we 
decided to record a large amount of speech from a smaller number 
of speakers. We had shown previously \[7\] that this training paradigm 
results in similar accuracy, with a smaller data collection effort (since 
the effort is largely proportional to the number of speakers rather than 
the total amount of speech.) 
We collected over 660 sentences from each of 15 speakers. Five 
were male and ten were female. Due to the lack of time, most of 
the speakers were from the northeast. However, we made an effort 
to include 4 female speakers from the Southeast and South Midland 
regions. We found that, once started, the subjects were able to collect 
about 300 sentences per hour comfortably. 
Nonspeech  Models 
One of the new problems in this speech data is that there were 
nonspeech sounds. Some were vocal sounds (e.g. "UH", "MIVI', cte.), 
while some were nonvocal (e.g. laughter, coughing, paper rostling, 
telephone tings, etc.). The only frequent nonspeech sound was "UH", 
with 57 occurrences in the training corpus. All the rest occurred oniy 
1 to 5 times. We created a separate "word" for each such event. Each 
consisted of it's own special phoneme or two phonemes. All of them 
were included in the same language model class within the statistical 
language model. 
While several of the nonspeech events were correctly detected in 
the development test speech, we found that the false alarm rate (i.e. 
typically recognizing a short word like "a" as "UH") was about equal 
to the detection rate. Thus, there was no real gain for using nonspeech 
models in our development experiments. 
Stat ist ical  Language Mode ls  
In this section, we discuss the use of statistical language models 
that have been estimated from very limited amounts of text. We 
argue that it is clearly necessary to group words into classes to avoid 
robustness problems. However, the optimal number of classes eems 
to be higher than expected. 
Since there is essentially no additional cost for using complex 
language models within the N-Best paradigm, we decided to use a 
4-gram statistical class grammar. 'Dmt is, the probability of the next 
word depends the classes of the three previous words. 
Need for Class Grarnma~'s An important area of research that has 
not received much attention is how to create powerful and robust 
statistical language models from a very limited amount of domain- 
dependent training data. We would eertainly like to be able to use 
more powerful language models than a simple word-based bigram 
model. 
Currently, the most powerful "fair" grammars used within the pro- 
gram have been statistical bigram class grammars. These grammars, 
which use padded maximum likeliD~od estimates of class pairs, al- 
low all words with some probability, and share the statistics for words 
that are within the same domain-dependent class. One issue of im- 
portance in defining a class grammar is the optimal number of classes 
into which words should be grouped. With more classes we can bet- 
ter distinguish between words, but with fewer classes there is more 
statistical sharing between words making the grammar more robust. 
We compared the perplexity with three different grammars for the 
RM task with 100 classes, 548 classes, and 1000 classes respectively. 
In the first, words were grouped mainly on syntactic grounds, with 
additional classes for the short very common words. In the second, 
we grouped into classes only those words that obviously belonged 
together. (That is, we had elt~.~es for shipnames, months, digits, etc.) 
Thus, most of the classes eoteained only one word. In the third gram- 
mar, there was a separate class for every word, thus resulting in a 
word-bigram grammar. We used the backing off algorithm to smooth 
the probabilities for unseen bigrarns. The Perplexities of the three 
grammars measured on training data and on independent sentences 
am given in the table below.

Training 79 20 14 
Test L 95 42 49 
Table 3: Perplexity for three bigram class grammars measured on the train- 
in 8 and test set. 
As shown in table 3, perplexity on the training set decreases as 
the number of classes increases, which is to be expected. What is 
interesting is the perplexity on the test set. Of the three grammars, 
the 548-class grammar results in the lowest test set perplexity. (Inter- 
estingly, the 548-class grammar is easier to specify than the 100-class 
grammar.) The increased perplexity for the 1000-class grammar is 
due to insufficient training data. 
The effective difference between the 548- and 1000-class gram- 
mars was larger than implied by the average perplexity. The standard 
deviation of the word entropy was one half bit higher, which resulted 
in a doubling in the standard eviation of the perplexity. To explain, 
the word bigram grammar frequently has unseen word pairs with very 
low probabih'ty, while this effect is greatly reduced in the class gram- 
mar. Thus, as expected, the class grammar is much more robust. 
Initial recognition e:-periments also seem to indicate a factor of two 
difference in error rate between a class bigram grammar and a word 
bigram grammar of the same perplexity. These effects are likely to 
be even larger when we use higher order n-gram models.

ATIS RECOGNIT ION RESULTS 
The table below contains the recognition results for the ATIS cor- 
pus for both the development test set and the evaluation set. The first 
line shows the recognition results for the development test set consist- 
ing of 138 sentences spoken by five speakers (bd, bf, bin, bp, bw). All 
speech data from these five speakers was left out of the training. The 
development results are given for the "augmented" enndition only. 
Next, we give the results for the ewAuation test set. The first two 
results are the baseline condition and our augmented condition. We 
also give results separately for the subset of 148 sentences that were 
designated as Class A (unambiguous, context-independent queries) 
for the NL evaluation. 
To review the two basic conditions, the baseline condition used 
the standard vocabulary, training set, and grammar throughout. The 
augmented condition used more training data, a 4-gram class gram- 
mar, and a nonspeech model.

ATIS speech recognition results. 
The first clear result is that the error rates for the evaluation test 
set are more than twice those of the development test set. In addition, 
the perplexity of the evaluation test set is significantly higher than for 
the development set (26 instead of 17 for the standard word-based 
bigram grammar, and 22 instead of 13 for the 4-gram class grammar). 
Thus, we surmise that the evaluation data is somehow significantly 
different han both the training data and the development test set. 
Next, it is clear that the Class A subset of the sentences presents 
fewer problems for the recognition. This is also indicated in the 
perplexities we computed for the two subsets. 
Finally, we see that, for both the full set of 200 sentences and 
the Class A subset of 148, the augmented enndition has about 20%- 
30% fewer word errors than the baseline condition. We are currently 
attempting to understand the causes of this improvement by more 
careful comparison to the baseline. The augmented condition was 
rerun after including the training data from the held-out development 
test speakers (about 900 utterances), but this made no difference. 
We suspect, therefore, that very little gain was also derived from 
the additional training speech collected at BBN (which suffers from 
both environmental nd dialectal differences). We have also retested 
with a class higram grammar instead of the 4-gram, and again, there 
was no change in performance. This behavior may be explained by 
the large difference between the evaluation test and the training. It 
is interesting, then, that the higher order grammar did not degrade 
in the presence of such a difference. This result also indicates that 
smoothing a word-based bigram by class definitions is important for 
training statistical grammars from small training corpora. We have not 
retested without he nonspeech models, but their eon~hation appears 
small from a preliminary review of the recognition errors made. The 
two worst test speakers were also the ones that tended to produce 
numerous pause fillers (e.g. "UH", "ulvr') as well as many other 
disfluencies. Clearly, better nonspeech modeling will be essential if
we continue to evaluate on this kind of data. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have reported several new benchmark speech recognition re- 
sults for both the RM corpus and the new ATIS corpus. On RM, using 
the standard 109 speaker training set and the word-pair grammar, the 
word error rate for the BYBLOS system was 3.8%. Surprisingly our 
new SI paradigm, using only 12 training speakers, achieved the same 
resnitl In addition, we have demonstrated that SI performance is
generally very bad for speakers with s-~ong dialects. But we have 
achieved a 5-fold reduction in error rate for these speakers by using 
speaker adaptation from only 40 training utterances. 
For the ATIS corpus we developed several new techniques based 
on the N-Best paradigm. These have allowed us to use cross-word 
triphone models and a 4-gram statistical grammar efficiently in the 
recognition. We have improved performance over a baseline condition 
by 20%-30% by using additional training, models of nonspeech, and 
a 4-gram class grammar. Our preliminary conclusion is that most of 
this gain is due to the smoothing of the grammar by classes. The 
spontaneous speech effects that appear in this corpus clearly present 
a new set of difficult problems, since the error rates are about 4 times 
higher than for the RM corpus.
