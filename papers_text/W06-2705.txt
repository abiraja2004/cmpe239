Abstract 
This paper presents the compilation of 
the CroCo Corpus, an English-German 
translation corpus. Corpus design, anno-
tation and alignment are described in de-
tail. In order to guarantee the searchabil-
ity and exchangeability of the corpus, 
XML stand-off mark-up is used as repre-
sentation format for the multi-layer anno-
tation. On this basis it is shown how the 
corpus can be queried using XQuery. 
Furthermore, the generalisation of results 
in terms of linguistic and translational re-
search questions is briefly discussed. 
1 Introduction 
In translation studies the question of how trans-
lated texts differ systematically from original 
texts has been an issue for quite some time with a 
surge of research in the last ten or so years. Ex-
ample-based contrastive analyses of small num-
bers of source texts and their translations had 
previously described characteristic features of 
the translated texts, without the availability of 
more large-scale empirical testing. Blum-Kulka 
(1986), for instance, formulates the hypothesis 
that explicitation is a characteristic phenomenon 
of translated versus original texts on the basis of 
linguistic evidence from individual sample texts 
showing that translators explicitate optional co-
hesive markers in the target text not realised in 
the source text. In general, explicitation covers 
all features that make implicit information in the 
source text clearer and thus explicit in the trans-
lation (cf. Steiner 2005).  
Building on example-based work like Blum-
Kulka?s, Baker put forward the notion of trans-
lation universals (cf. Baker 1996) which can be 
analysed in corpora of translated texts regardless 
of the source language in comparison to original 
texts in the target language. Olohan and Baker 
(2000) therefore analyse explicitation in English 
translations concentrating on the frequency of the 
optional that versus zero-connector in combina-
tion with the two verbs say and tell. While being 
extensive enough for statistical interpretation, 
corpus-driven research like Olohan and Baker's 
is limited in its validity to the selected strings.  
More generally speaking, there is a gap be-
tween the abstract research object and the low le-
vel features used as indicators. This gap can be 
reduced by operationalising notions like explicit-
tation into syntactic and semantic categories, 
which can be annotated and aligned in a corpus. 
Intelligent queries then produce linguistic evi-
dence with more explanatory power than low le-
vel data obtained from raw corpora. The results 
are not restricted to the queried strings but extend 
to more complex units sharing the syntactic and/ 
or semantic properties obtained by querying the 
annotation.  
This methodology serves as a basis for the 
CroCo project, in which the assumed translation 
property of explicitation is investigated for the 
language pair English ? German. The empirical 
evidence for the investigation consists in a cor-
pus of English originals, their German transla-
tions as well as German originals and their Eng-
lish translations. Both translation directions are 
represented in eight registers. Biber?s calcula-
tions, i.e. 10 texts per register with a length of at 
least 1,000 words, serve as an orientation for the 
size of the sub-corpora (cf. Biber 1993). Alto-
35
gether the CroCo Corpus comprises one million 
words. Additionally, reference corpora are in-
cluded for German and English. The reference 
corpora are register-neutral including 2,000 word 
samples from 17 registers (see Neumann & Han-
sen-Schirra 2005 for more details on the CroCo 
corpus design).  
The CroCo Corpus is tokenised and annotated 
for part-of-speech, morphology, phrasal catego-
ries and grammatical functions. Furthermore, the 
following (annotation) units are aligned: words, 
grammatical functions, clauses and sentences. 
The annotation and alignment steps are described 
in section 2.  
Each annotation and alignment layer is stored 
separately in a multi-layer stand-off XML repre-
sentation format. In order to empirically investi-
gate the parallel corpus (e.g. to find evidence for 
explicitation in translations), XQuery is used for 
posing linguistic queries. The query process it-
self works on each layer separately, but can also 
be applied across different annotation and align-
ment layers. It is described in more detail in sec-
tion 3. This way, parallel text segments and/or 
parallel annotation units can be extracted and 
compared for translations and originals in Ger-
man and English. 
2 CroCo XML 
The annotation in CroCo extends to different 
levels in order to cover possible linguistic evi-
dence on each level. Thus, each kind of annota-
tion (part-of-speech, morphology, phrase struc-
ture, grammatical functions) is realised in a sepa-
rate layer. An additional layer is included which 
contains comprehensive metainformation in se-
parate header files for each text in the corpus. 
The file containing the indexed tokens (see sec-
tion 2.1) includes an xlink attribute referring to 
this header file as depicted in Figure 2.1. The 
metadata are based on the TEI guidelines1 and 
include register information. The complex multi-
lingual structure of the corpus in combination 
with the multi-layer annotation requires indexing 
the corpus. The indexing is carried out on the ba-
sis of the tokenised corpus. Index and annotation 
layers are kept separate using XML stand-off 
mark-up. The mark-up builds on XCES2. Differ-
ent formats of the multiple annotation and align-
ment outputs are converted with Perl scripts. 
Each annotation and alignment unit is indexed.

2 http://www.xml-ces.org 
The respective annotations and alignments are 
linked to the indexed units via XPointers.  
The following sections describe the different 
annotation layers and are exemplified for the 
German original sentence in (1) and its English 
translation in (2)3. 
 
(1) Ich spielte viele M?glichkeiten 
durch, stellte mir den T?ter in 
verschiedenen Posen vor, ich und 
die Pistole, ich und die Giftfla-
sche, ich und der Kn?ppel, ich und 
das Messer. 
 
(2) I ran through numerous possibi-
lities, pictured the perpetrator in 
various poses, me with the gun, me 
with the bottle of poison, me with 
the bludgeon, me with the knife. 
2.1 Tokenisation and indexing 
The first layer to be presented here is the tokeni-
sation layer. Tokenisation is performed in CroCo 
for both German and English by TnT (Brants 
2000), a statistical part-of-speech tagger. As 
shown in Figure 2.1 each token annotated with 
the attribute strg has also an id attribute, which 
indicates the position of the word in the text. 
This id represents the anchor for all XPointers 
pointing to the tokenisation file by an id starting 
with a ?t?. The file is identified by the name at-
tribute. The xml:lang attribute indicates the lan-
guage of the file, docType provides information 
on whether the present file is an original or a 
translation.

Similar index files necessary for the alignment of 
the respective levels are created for the units 
chunk, clause and sentence. These units stand in

of clauses, clauses consisting of chunks etc.  
2.2 Part-of-speech tagging 
The second layer annotated for both languages is 
the part-of-speech layer, which is provided again 
by TnT4. The token annotation of the part-of-
speech layer starts with the xml:base attribute, 
which indicates the index file it refers to. The 
part-of-speech information for each token is an-
notated in the pos attribute, as shown in Figure 
2.2. The attribute strg in the token index file and 
pos in the tag annotation are linked by an xlink 
attribute pointing to the id attribute in the index 
file. For example, the German token pointing to 
"t65" in the token index file whose strg value is 
stellte is a finite verb (with the PoS tag vvfin).

2.3 Morphological annotation 
Morphological information is particularly rele-
vant for German due to the fact that this lan-
guage carries much syntactic information within 
morphemes rather than in separate function 
words like English. Morphology is annotated in 
CroCo with MPro, a rule-based morphology tool 
(Maas 1998). This tool works on both languages. 
As shown in Figure 2.3 each token has morpho-
logical attributes such as person, case, gender, 
number and lemma. As before, the xlink attrib-
ute refers back to the index file, thus providing 
the connection between the morphological attri-
butes and the strg information in the index file.  
For the morphological annotation of the Ger-
man token "t65" in Figure 2.3 the strg value is 
determined by following the XPointer "t65" to 
the token index file, i.e. spielte. The pos value is 
retrieved by searching in the tag annotation for 
                                                 
4 For German we use the STTS tag set (Schiller et al 1999), 
and for English the Susanne tag set (Sampson 1995). 
the file with the same xml:base value. The 
matching tag, in this case vvfin, carries the same 
XPointer ?t65?.

2.4 Phrase chunking and annotation of 
grammatical functions 
Moving up from the token unit to the chunk unit, 
first we have to index these units again before we 
can annotate them. The chunk index file assigns 
an id attribute to each chunk within the file. The 
problem of discontinuous phrase chunks is 
solved by listing child tags referring to the indi-
vidual tokens which make up the chunk via xlink 
attributes. Figure 2.4 shows that the VP ?ch14? 
in the German phrase annotation consists of 
?t70? (stellte) and ?t77? (vor).

Figure 2.4. Chunk indexing 
 
The phrase structure annotation (see Figure 2.5) 
assigns the ps attribute to each phrase chunk 
identified by MPro. XPointers link the phrase 
structure annotation to the chunk index file. It 
should be noted that in CroCo the phrase struc-
ture analysis is limited to higher chunk nodes, as 
our focus within this layer is more on complete 
phrase chunks and their grammatical functions.

Figure 2.5. Phrase structure annotation 
 
The annotation of grammatical functions is again 
kept in a separate file (see Figure 2.6). Only the 
highest phrase nodes are annotated for their 
grammatical function with the attribute gf. The 
XPointer links the annotation of each function to 
the chunk id in the chunk index file. From this 
file in turn the string can be retrieved in the token 
annotation. For example, the English chunk 
?ch13? carries the grammatical function of direct 
object (DOBJ). It is identified as an NP in the 
phrase structure annotation by comparing the 
xml:base attribute value of the two files and the 
XPointers.

2.5 Alignment 
In the examples shown so far, the different anno-
tation layers linked to each other all belonged to 
the same language. By aligning words, gram-
matical functions, clauses and sentences, the 
connection between original and translated text is 
made visible. The use of this multi-layer align-
ment will become clearer from the discussion of 
a sample query in section 3. 
For the purpose of the CroCo project word 
alignment is realised with GIZA++ (Och & Ney 
2003), a statistical alignment tool. Chunks and 
clauses are aligned manually with the help of 
MMAX II (M?ller & Strube 2003), a tool allow-
ing assignment of own categories and linking 
units. Finally, sentences are aligned using Win-
Align, an alignment tool within the Translator?s 
Workbench by Trados (Heyn 1996). 
The alignment procedure produces four new 
layers. It follows the XCES standard. Figure 2.7 
shows the chunk alignment of (1) and (2). In this 
layer, we align on the basis of grammatical func-
tions instead of phrases since this annotation in-
cludes the information of the phrase chunking as 
well as on the semantic relations of the chunks. 
The grammatical functions are mapped onto each 
other cross-linguistically and then aligned ac-
cording to our annotation and alignment scheme. 
The trans.loc attribute locates the chunk index 
file for the aligned texts in turn. Furthermore, the 
respective language as well as the n attribute or-
ganising the order of the aligned texts are given. 
We thus have an alignment tag for each language 
in each chunk pointing to the chunk index file. 
As can be seen from Figure 2.7, chunks which do 
not have a matching equivalent receive the value 
?#undefined?, a phenomenon that will be of in-
terest in the linguistic interpretation on the basis 
of querying the corpus.

3 Querying the CroCo Corpus 
The comprehensive annotation including the 
alignment described in section 2 is the basis for 
the interpretation to be presented in what fol-
lows. We concentrate on two types of queries 
into the different alignment layers that are as-
sumed relevant in connection with our research 
question.  
3.1 Crossing lines and empty links 
From the linguistic point of view we are inter-
ested in those units in the target text which do 
not have matches in the source text and vice 
versa, i.e. empty links, or whose alignment 
crosses the alignment of a higher level, i.e. 
crossing lines. We analyse for instance stretches 
of text contained in one sentence in the source 
text but spread over two sentences in the target 
text, as this probably has implications for the 
overall information contained in the target text. 
We would thus pose a query retrieving all in-
stances where the alignment of the lower level is 
not parallel to the higher level alignment but 
points into another higher level unit. In the ex-
ample below the German source sequence (3) as 
well as the English target sequence (4) both con-
sist of three sentences. These sentences are each 
aligned as illustrated by dashed boxes in Figure 
3.1.  
(3) Aus dem Augenwinkel sah ich, 
wie eine Schwester dem Bettnachbarn 
das Nachthemd wechselte. Sie rieb 
den R?cken mit Franzbranntwein ein 
und massierte den etwas j?ngeren 
Mann, dessen Adern am ganzen K?rper 
bl?ulich hervortraten. Ihre H?nde 
lie?en ihn leise wimmern.  
(4) Out of the corner of my eye I 
watched a nurse change his 
neighbor?s nightshirt and rub his 
back with alcoholic liniment. She 
massaged the slightly younger man, 
whose veins stood out blue all over 
his body. He whimpered softly under 
her hands.  
 
In German the first two sentences are subdivided 
into two clauses each. The English target sen-
tences are co-extensive with the clauses con-
tained in each sentence. This means that two 
English clauses have to accommodate four Ger-
man clauses. Figure 3.1 shows that the German 
clause 3 (Sie rieb den R?cken mit Franzbrannt-
wein ein) in sentence 2 is part of the bare infini-
tive complementation (?and rub his back with 
alcoholic liniment) in the English sentence 1. 
The alignment of this clause points out of the 
aligned first sentence, thus constituting crossing 
lines.

The third sentence also contains a crossing line, 
in this case on the levels of chunk and word 
alignment: The words Ihre H?nde in the German 
subject chunk are aligned with the words her 
hands in the English adverbial chunk. However, 
this sentence is particularly interesting in view of 
empty links. The query asks for units not match-
ing any unit in the parallel text, i.e. for xlink at-
tributes whose values are ?#undefined? (cf. sec-
tion 2.5). In Figure 3.2, the empty links are 
marked by a black dot.

Our linguistic interpretation is based on a func-
tional view of language. Hence, the finite lie?en 
(word 3) in the German sentence is interpreted as 
a semi-auxiliary and thus as the finite part of the 
verbal group. Therefore, wimmern (word 6) re-
ceives the label PRED, i.e. the non-finite part of 
the verb phrase, in the functional analysis. This 
German word is linked to word 2 (whimpered) in 
the target sentence, which is assigned FIN, i.e. 
the finite verb in the layer of grammatical func-
tions. As FIN exists both in the source and in the 
target sentences, this chunk is aligned. The Ger-
man functional unit PRED does not have an 
equivalent in the target text and gets an empty 
link. Consequently, word 3 in the source sen-
tence (lie?en) receives an empty link as well. 
This mismatch will be interpreted in view of our 
translation-oriented research. In the following 
subsection we will see how these two phenom-
ena can be retrieved automatically.  
3.2 Corpus exploitation using XQuery 
Since the multi-dimensional annotation and 
alignment is realised in XML, the queries are 
posed using XQuery5. This query language is 
particularly suited to retrieve information from 
different sources like for instance individual an-
notation and alignment files. The use for multi-
layer annotation is shown in (Teich et al 2001).  
The query for determining an empty link at 
word level can be formulated as follows: find all 
words which do not have an aligned correspon-
dent, i.e. which carry the xlink attribute value 
?#undefined?. The same query can be applied on 
the chunk level, the query returning the gram-
matical functions that do not have an equivalent 
in the other language.  
 
(5)Ihre H?nde lie?en ihn leise wim-
mern.  
(6) He whimpered softly under her 
hands.  
 
Applied to the sentences in (5) and (6) the 
XQuery in Figure 3.3 returns all German and 
English words, which receive an empty link due 
to a missing equivalent in alignment (lie?en and 
under). This query can be used analogously in all 
other alignment layers. It implies the call of a 
self-defined XQuery function (see Figure 3.4), 
which looks in the correspondent index file for 
words not aligned.

ment 
 
Querying crossing lines in the German source 
sentence in (5) and the English target sentence in 
(6) is based on the annotation at word level as 
well as on the annotation at the chunk level. As 
mentioned in section 3.1, crossing lines are iden-
tified in (5) and (6) if the words contained in the 
chunks aligned on the grammatical function layer 
are not aligned on the word level. This means 
that the German subject is aligned with the Eng-
lish subject, but the words within the subject 
chunk are aligned with words in other grammati-
cal functions instead. 
In a first step, the query for determining a 
crossing line requires information about all 
aligned German chunks with a xlink attribute 
whose value is not ?#undefined? and all aligned 
German words with a xlink attribute whose 
value is not ?#undefined?. Then all German 
words that are not aligned on the word level but 
are aligned as part of chunks on the chunk level 
40
are filtered out. Figure 3.6 reflects the respective 
XQuery.

for $k in $doc//chunks/chunk

Figure 3.6. XQuery for crossing lines 
 
First, the aligned chunks ($ch1 and $ch2) are 
saved into variables. These values are important 
in order to detect the span for each of the chunks 
($ch1/tok[position()=1], $ch1/tok[last()] and 
$ch2/tok[position()=1], $ch2/tok[last()]), and to 
identify the words making up the source chunks 
as well as their German or English equivalents. 
In the second step all words that do not have 
empty links are saved ($tok1 and $tok2). The 
last step filters the crossing lines, i.e. word align-
ments pointing out of the chunk alignment. For 
this purpose, we define a new function (local:-
containsToken) which tests whether a word be-
longs to a chunk or not. By applying local:con-
tainsToken for the German original and not-
(local:containsToken) for the English transla-
tion, all words in the German chunks whose 
aligned English equivalent words do not belong 
to the aligned English chunks are retrieved. The 
example query returns the German words Ihre 
H?nde that are part of the German subject chunk 
and which are aligned with the English words 
her hands that again are part of the second ad-
verbial chunk. 
4 Summary and conclusions 
In a broader view, it can be observed that there is 
an increasing need in richly annotated corpora 
across all branches of linguistics. The same holds 
for linguistically interpreted parallel corpora in 
translation studies. Usually, though, the problem 
with large-scale corpora is that they do not re-
flect the complexity of linguistic knowledge we 
are used to dealing with in linguistic theory. 
Simple research questions can of course be an-
swered on the basis of raw corpora or with the 
help of an automatic part-of-speech tagging. 
Most linguistics and translation scholars are, 
however, interested in more complex questions 
like the interaction of syntax and semantics 
across languages.  
The research described here shows the use of 
comprehensive multi-layer annotation across 
languages. By relating a highly abstract research 
question to multiple layers of lexical and gram-
matical realisations, characteristic patterns of 
groups of texts, e.g. explicitation in translations 
and originals in the case of the CroCo project, 
can be identified on the basis of statistically rele-
vant linguistic evidence. 
If we want to enrich corpora with multiple 
kinds of linguistic information, we need a lin-
guistically motivated model of the linguistic 
units and relations we would like to extract and 
draw conclusions based on an annotated and 
aligned corpus. So the first step for the compila-
tion of a parallel translation corpus is to provide 
a classification of linguistic units and relations 
and their mappings across source and target lan-
guages. The classification of English and Ger-
man linguistic units and relations chosen for the 
CroCo project (i.e. for the investigation of ex-
plicitation in translations and originals) is re-
flected in the CroCo annotation and alignment 
schemes and thus in the CroCo Corpus annota-
tion and alignment.  
From a technical point of view, the representa-
tion of a multilingual resource comprehensively 
41
annotated and aligned is to be realised in such a 
way that 
? multiple linguistic perspectives on the corpus 
are possible since different annotations and 
alignments can be investigated independ-
ently or in combination, 
? the corpus format guarantees best possible 
accessibility and exchangeability, and 
? the exploitation of the corpus is possible us-
ing easily available tools for search and 
analysis. 
We coped with this challenge by introducing a 
multi-layer stand-off corpus representation for-
mat in XML (see section 2), which takes into ac-
count not only the different annotation layers 
needed from a linguistic point of view, but also 
multiple alignment layers necessary to investi-
gate different translation relations.  
We also showed how the CroCo resource can 
be applied to complex research questions in lin-
guistics and translation studies using XQuery to 
retrieve multi-dimensional linguistic information 
(see section 3). Based on the stand-off storage of 
annotation and alignment layers combined with 
the possibility to exploit the required layers 
through intelligent queries, parallel text segments 
and/or parallel annotation units can be extracted 
and compared across languages. 
In order to make the CroCo resource available 
to researchers not familiar with the complexities 
of XML mark-up and the XQuery language, a 
graphical user interface will be implemented in 
Java which allows formulating queries without 
knowledge of the XQuery syntax.
