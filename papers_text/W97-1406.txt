This paper deals with aspects of the resolu- 
tion of deictic and elliptic expressions that 
are related to gestures. It discusses differ- 
ent approaches todistinguish between deic- 
tic pointing and manipulative gestures. We 
compare two strategies of combining nat- 
ural multimodal communication with di- 
rect manipulation. The first approach uses 
click free mouse gestures for deictic point- 
ing, while manipulative gestures are per- 
formed by using mouse button events as is 
usual in graphic interfaces. The second ap- 
proach uses a touchscreen asgestural input 
device. 
1 In t roduct ion  
This paper deals with aspects of the resolution of 
deictic and elliptic expressions that are related to 
gestures. It discusses two approaches to distinguish 
between deictic pointing and manipulative gestures. 
The resolution methods for both approaches have 
been implemented in a project for the development 
of a multimodal interface for route-planning, traf- 
fic information and driver guidance MOFA (Ger- 
man acronym for "Multimodale Fahrerinformation"- 
"Multimodal Driver Information"). 1 We proved 
the reusability of the methods and the architecture 
of MOFA in a completely different domain by imple- 
menting a prototype for multimodal calendar man- 
agement (the system TALKY). 
The input modalities supported by our system are 
spoken and written natural language, deictic point- 
ing gestures and the interaction methods known 
from direct manipulation systems. As input devices 
for gestures we use either a mouse or touch screen

technology. The latter allows the user to perform 
deictical pointing in an (almost) natural way. 
Our approach to multimodal systems aims at a 
smooth integration of a conversational communica- 
tion style with the features of direct manipulation. 
By conversational style of multimodal communica- 
tion we understand the use of natural speech sup- 
ported by deictical gestures, as in the combination 
of the utterance "an dem Tag gesch~iftlich in Kalser- 
slautern", ("at this day in Kalserslautern for busi- 
ness") with a pointing act to a graphical presenta- 
tion of the day under consideration. In this example 
the gesture acts only passively, supplying the spo- 
ken utterance with additional information. In con- 
trast gestures used in direct manipulation are active, 
they are expected to trigger some action by the sys- 
tem, e.g. clicking at an icon which represents "1st 
of May" opens a representation f this day. Verbal 
utterances that accompany or follow such gestures 
may be related to this gesture: 
? If in this context he user utters "um 12 Uhr 
in Raum 17" ("at 12 o'clock in room 17") it is 
most likely that he specifies an appointment a
the 1st of May. In this case the elliptic verbal 
utterance can be resolved by the manipulative 
gesture. 
? But if the user utters "at 2nd of May meeting 
with Mr. X" he performs an unrelated tasks. 
2 Overview of the System 
Architecture of MOFA 
In our architecture the MOFA interface is organized 
into four main components hat are realized as in- 
dependent processes that communicate via sockets: 
? The Graphical Interface (GI) for gestural input 
and graphical output, 
? the Speech Recognizer (SR), 
Active and Passive Gestures 45 
? the multimodal interpretation, dialogue and 
presentation planning process (MIDP) 
? and the speech synthesis component (SYN). 
The back end application (AP) may be integrated 
in the MIDP or realized as separate process (in case 
of MOFA, the AP is the route planner). This or- 
ganization allows for parallel input and output and 
also an overlapp of user input, interpretation and 
presentation. 
The GI sends both gestural events like pointing 
to an object or selecting a menu item, and written 
input to the MIDP. It also realizes graphical presen- 
tations, which are planned by the MIDP. The speech 
recognizer is activated by the user via a speech- 
button which can be operated from the GI. We do 
this to avoid problems with recognition results that 
are not intended by the user (see \[Gauvain 96\]). 
Both the results of the speech recognition and the 
input processed by the GI are augmented with time 
information. 
The MIDP consists of the following components: 
1. The input controller checks if modalities are 
used in parallel or subsequently and determines 
temporal relations between events. 
2. The interpretation module is responsible for ro- 
bust parsing and plan recognition. Parsing and 
plan recognition work in close interaction and 
produce a task oriented representation. The in- 
terpretation depends on the dialogue state as 
specified by the clarification or the continua- 
tion module. The interpretation module also 
handles gestures that the input controler recog- 
nizes as monomodal input. 
3. Deictic and elliptic expressions are resolved in 
the resolution module. 
4. A plan library and a simple domain model sup- 
port plan recognition and resolution. 
5. The clarification module checks in a case based 
manner the partly instantiated task hypotheses. 
It first tries silently to repair certain inconsis- 
tencies and then starts a clarification dialogue 
or calls the back end application. The clarifica- 
tion module has an interface to the user model 
which proposes fillers for parameters which are 
not specified by the user. 
6. The continuation module decides if the system 
keeps the initiative or if it simply waits for 
further user input. The modules (5) and (6) 
also control speech recognition. Depending on 
the dialog state they select he appropriate lan- 
guage model. 
7. The presentation module plans the presentation 
of the result of an application call. It controls 
the output of SYN and GI. 
8. The user model follows a memory based learn- 
ing approach. The user model is an optional 
module, since it can be left out from the system 
without any changes to modules.

3 Two implemented Applications: 
Sample Interactions with MOFA 
and TALKY 
In MOFA, the interaction style is mainly conversa- 
tional, menus are only used for commands on the 
meta level (e.g starting a trip simualtion along a 
planned route, or introducing some external events 
46 M. Streit 
into the trip simulation (e.g. invoking a traffic jam). 
TALKY is much more a mixture between manipu- 
lative interaction and multimodal conversation. If 
the system is running on a SUN Ultra Sparc, speech 
recognition is real time, if the user speaks slowly. 
In the following we give three examples which are 
processed by our systems MOFA and TALKY. In 
these examples, natural language is spoken, unless 
otherwise stated. System reactions are given in spo- 
ken and written form. In our sample dialogs ,/a, 
indicates a pointing gesture, '/~(Y)' means that the 
gesture is unambiguously pointing to some object, 
where Y refers to an object on the screen.

4 Problems with the integration of 
direct manipulation and natural 
mult imoda l  dialog 
In direct manipulation gestures lead to an imme- 
diate reaction. The referent of a gesture is always 
unambiguous: Either there is a single object selected 
or the gesture is not successful at all. In this pro- 
cess of selection only the gesture and the objects 
are involved. In natural communication deictic ges- 
tures may be vague or ambiguous. They have to 
be interpreted by considering context and the nat- 
ural language utterances that occur together with 
the gesture. The possibility of modifying a pointing 
gesture by spoken information is not a weakness but 
a valuable feature multimodal communication, that 
makes it easier to refer to structured objects or to 
closely assembled tiny objects. 
For multimodal systems we are faced with the 
problem that speech recognition and natural lan- 
guage analysis takes some time, which is somewhat 
contrary to the immediate reaction expected from 
direct manipulative gestures. The problem cannot 
be completely solved by making analysis faster be- 
cause the user may want to perform some manipula- 
tion and see the result while he is speaking a longer 
utterance. 
If we could distinguish the manipulative or deictic 
nature of the gesture by analysing it's form and the 
object referred to we could avoid waiting for linguis- 
tic analysis. In the following we will discuss some 
approaches for a solution of this problem. 
5 Act ive  and  Pass ive  gestures  
Without the support of other modalities, an active 
gesture determines an ction of the system (in case 
of a graphical user interface) or it causes the dia- 
log partner to perform an action (in case of natural 
communication). A passive or "merely referential" 
pointing gesture serves only as a reference to objects 
and does not call for any reaction, aside from rec- 
ognizing the act of reference. The gesture may be 
ambiguous or vague. Passive gestures are not always 
communicative in nature (e.g someone may point at 
a map to support his own perception without any 
intention to communicate an act of reference). 
If a gesture is active depends on the form of the 
gesture (e.g. moving the mouse to some object is a 
passive form, pressing a mouse button at an object 
is an active form), but also on the object, which be- 
ing referred to with the gesture. E.G. a mouse click 
performed on a menu item will start an action, while 
clicking on a picture may be without any result. We 
will now give a short definition of passive and ac- 
48 M. Streit 
tive gesture forms and of passive and active objects. 
Then we analyse possible combinations. 
Passive gesture forms are not used to trigger ac- 
tions, they may be used non-communicatively. Ac- 
tive forms are always intended communication, they 
may be used to trigger an action. Passive objects 
serve only as potential referents of referential acts, 
while active objects react if they are activated by 
an active gesture form without the support by other 
modalities. There may be mixed objects as well, 
that behave actively using certain active gesture 
forms and passively with others. With passive ges- 
ture forms every object behaves passive by defini- 
tion. 
There are six possible cases for a combination of 
objects with gesture forms: 
1. Passive gesture forms performed on passive ob- 
ject 
2. Passive gesture forms performed on mixed ob- 
ject 
3. Passive gesture forms performed on active ob- 
jects 
4. Active gesture forms performed on passive ob- 
ject 
5. Active gesture forms performed on mixed object 
6. Active gesture forms performed on active ob- 
jects 
We consider cases (1) to (4) as passive gestures, 
while (6) is considered an active one. If (5) is ac- 
tive or passive depends on the concrete gesture form. 
Passive gestures are candidates for conversationaly 
used deictic gestures, while manipulative gestures 
must be active. In the following, we will discuss 
two approaches to distinguish between deictic and 
manipulative uses of gestures. 
5.1 Distinction between Deietic and 
Manipulative Gestures by Active and 
Passive Gesture Forms 
To allow for a coexistence of natural communica- 
tion style and direct manipulative interaction in one 
multimodal interface we dedicate 
? (1),(2) and (3) to natural communication 
? and (4),(5) and (6) to graphical interaction ((4) 
could be seen as a communication failure or as 
an attempt o perform natural communication 
by manipulative gestures). 
This results in a clear cut between the communi- 
cation styles: GUIs take passive gesture forms as 
non-communicative. They may give feedback and 
highlight the object the user is pointing to, but we 
must not count this as an action, because it does 
not change the state of the dialog. This means that 
the gestures dedicated to natural multimodal inter- 
action can operate on every object of the graphically 
represented universe of discourse, without unwanted 
manipulative ffects. Another advantage of this ap- 
proach is, that the user can keep with the graphic 
interaction style, he is familiar with from graphi- 
cal interfaces. There is no conflict with the selec- 
tion process (i.e. the direct manipulative principle 
of reference resolution). We can introduce an addi- 
tional process, which combines ambiguous or vague 
information from deictic pointing with natural lan- 
guage information. Furthermore, passive pointing 
gestures with the mouse are much more convenient 
than active ones if they are performed in parallel 
with speech. We noticed that the coordination of 
mouse clicks with deictic expressions requires high 
concentration on the side of the user and frequently 
leads to errors. This is quite different with touch- 
screens. We followed the approach, presented in this 
section, in an earlier version of MOFA (cf. section 6 
Experience with Act ive  and  Passive Gesture Forms 
- MOFA with the Mouse as Input Device). We ob- 
served two problems with that approach. 
? It may be difficult to decide between commu- 
nicative and non-communicative uses of passive 
gesture forms. 
? If we use other input devices than the mouse, 
the distinction between passive and active ges- 
ture forms may be not available , or only be 
achievable by an artificial introduction of new 
gestures. 
5.2 Distinction between Deictic and 
Manipulative Gestures by different 
Active Gesture Forms 
If we make all graphically represented objects mixed 
or passive we arrive again at a clear cut between 
styles, by distinguishing between certain types of ac- 
tive gesture forms. The advantage of this approach 
is, that there is no problem with non-communicative 
uses of gestures. But with this approach we have to 
change the usual meaning of gestures and the usual 
behaviour of objects, that are not mixed (e.g. menu 
items or buttons are active objects). Gestures will 
also tend to become more complicated (in some cases 
we need double clicks instead of simple clicks to ac- 
tivate an action). 
Active and Passive Gestures 49 
If we do not change the normal behaviour of ob- 
jects, we stay with objects for which we cannot de- 
cide if a gesture is meant deicticly or manipulatively. 
In particular, this means that graphical selection 
may prevent pointing gestures from being modified 
by speech. 
There is another small problem with active gesture 
forms. The user may expect that using them will 
cause some action even with passive objects, if the 
context or the nature of the objects suggests how to 
interpret such gestures. 
We will elaborate on these problems in sections 
8.1 Deictic Expressions and Pointing Gestures and 
8.3 Deictic Pointing Gestures as Autonumuos Com- 
municative Acts. 
6 Exper ience  w i th  Act ive  and  
Pass ive  Gesture  Forms - MOFA 
wi th  the  Mouse  as  Input  Dev ice  
This version is implemented with mouse-based ges- 
tural communication. We used active gesture forms 
to achieve manipulative ffects and passive ones for 
deictic pointing. Because the mouse has to move 
across the screen to point to a certain referent, it is 
very likely that objects are touched without inten- 
tion. This is especially important for route descrip- 
tions, where several pointing acts occur during one 
spoken command. Different filters are used to take 
out unintended referents. 
? First, the search for referents is restricted to a 
time frame which is a bit longer than the inter- 
val within the user is speaking. 
? Next, type restrictions are applied to the pos- 
sible referents. Type restrictions are inferred 
from deictic expressions e.g. "diese Strasse" 
" this street","diese U-Bahnstation" - "this 
tube station", but also from inherent restric- 
tions concerning the recognized task(s). 
? Finally, we exploit the fact that deictic expres- 
sions and deictic gestures are strictly synchro- 
nized in natural speech. The problem with 
this approach is that speech recognizers usu- 
ally do not deliver time information on the word 
level. Therefore time stamps on the word level 
are interpolations. There is only a rudimen- 
tary analysis of the track and the temporal 
course of the mouse movement. Such an analy- 
sis would certainly improve referent resolution, 
though we noticed that pointing was sometimes 
not marked and on the other hand, users made 
pauses during mouse movement without point- 
ing intentionally. 
In this MOFA version we can only use linguistic 
information to identify a task. The identification 
of referents by gesture analysis alone is to uncer- 
tain to use the type of the referents for task recog- 
nition. This is different in the recent touchscreen 
based MOFA version, which we will describe in the 
following. 
7 MOFA and TALKY - the  vers ion  
fo r  touchscreen  input  
The recent versions of MOFA and TALKY are im- 
plemented with touchscreen technology as input de- 
vice. The version also works with a mouse as input 
device, but in this case the user must perform mouse 
clicks for deictic pointing. 
With touchscreens, every pointing to the screen is 
normally mapped to mouse button events. There are 
no passive gestures at all. The distinction of deictic 
gestures must rely on active gesture forms. Further- 
more, the problem of vague or ambiguous pointing 
becomes more prominent: In the usual implementa- 
tion of touchscreens, pointing with the finger will be 
mapped to some exact coordination, but these co- 
ordinates are only vaguely related to the point the 
user wanted to refer to. A big advantage of touch- 
screen technology is that there is no problem with 
unintended pointing. Although there is additional 
vagueness in pointing, we can use type information 
that we get from referents much easier than with 
passive mouse gestures. Also, active pointing at 
the touchscreen is completely natural in combina- 
tion with speech. 
8 Reference  Phenomena in  MOFA 
and TALKY 
The system handles temporal and spatial deixis, and 
also certain phenomena t the borderline of deictic 
and anaphoric reference. It is able to treat elliptic 
expressions, in which gestures upply missing argu- 
ments (deictical ellipsis). The system resolves ellip- 
tic expressions and anaphora that occur in in modi- 
fication and follow up tasks. Also dialog ellipsis and 
elliptic utterances that introduce new tasks are han- 
dled. Many expressions including temporal deixis 
are not resolved by deictical gestures, but by com- 
putation of values, depending on the speaking time 
(e.g. heute (today)). Because of the graphic repre- 
sentation of time objects especially in the calendar 
application, there are also deictic gestures referring 
to temporal entities. Deictic expressions occur as 
demonstrative NPs (e.g. diese Kreuzung (this cross- 
ing)) definite NPs (die Route (the route)) and also 
as adverbs (dorthin (there), dann (then), heute (to- 
50 M. Streit 
day)). The NPs and some of the adverbs are also 
used anaphoricly. 
? In MOFA the universe of discourse is the map. 
The objects on the map are not of the active 
type. The interaction with the map is not ma- 
nipulative, but conversational. There are also 
some menu items, to which the user will hardly 
refer deicticly. 
? In TALKY there are many active objects. The 
user may navigate in the calendar by speech or 
by manipulating graphical interaction elements. 
In contrast to MOFA there are manipulative ob- 
jects, that are likely to be referred to also by 
deictic gestures. 
8.1 Deictic Expressions and Point ing 
Gestures 
Reference resolution for gestures as usual in graph- 
ical user interfaces works in an unambiguously way. 
To handle vague pointing we introduce transparent 
fields that constitute neighbourhoods for clusters of 
objects. The selection of these fields or of one ob- 
ject on such a fields makes the neighbouring objects 
salient as referents. (cf. section 3 Two implemented 
Applications: Sample Interactions with MOFA and 
TALKY, example 1 Route Planning). Now type in- 
formation is used as a filter. In example 1 every ob- 
ject that is a possible starting point for a car route 
and also every tube-stations i  of appropriate type. 
If there remains more than one referent, or there is 
no referent left, a clarification dialog is invoked, the 
dialog must not be performed by natural language 
only, zooming on the cluster is also a possible reac- 
tion. 
? (1) " zu dieser U-Bahnstation ("to that tube- 
stat ion") /~ 
In (1) referent resolution applies the type restriction 
tube-node before any clarification dialog is invoked. 
? (2) "dorthin" ("to there") ,2(U1) "von 
dort" (from there") ~2~(U2) 
In (2) the system first recognizes an abstract ask 
route planning. If the two referents of the gestures 
are tube stations the system does that know by an 
unambiguous gesture or after a clarification dialog. 
The system will use these type constraints to recog- 
nize the concrete task "find a tube connection". 
8.2 Elliptic Expression and Point ing 
Gestures 
? (3) mit der U-Bahn (by tube) /~ ,~ 
(3) is an example for an elliptic expression related 
to deictic gestures. The gestures upply additional 
arguments to the task "plan a tube connection". In 
account of the order of the arguments, MOFA will 
guess the first referent is the start, the second is 
the destination of the route. The task is identified 
by analyzing the elliptic expression. The Task now 
imposes type restriction on the arguments. 
8.3 Deictic Point ing Gestures as 
Autonumuos  Communicat ive  Acts 
We recall the fact, that we use active gesture forms 
as deictic (i.e. passive) gestures in the touchscreen 
version of MOFA. As mentioned in section 5.2 this 
may give the user the idea to use them actively 
to communicate without speech. It is very natural 
to order a ticket just by e.g. saying "Saarbrficken 
Mfinchen" with the first town as starting point and 
the second town as destination. Similar one can 
describe a route on a map by pointing first to the 
start and then to the destination. In contrast, if the 
user is pointing only once, it is most likely, that he 
means the destination of a route. Such pointing acts 
communicate he same informations as speaking the 
names of the locations. This way to communicate is 
a sort of natural communication, that does not fit to 
direct manipulation. The interpretation of the first 
pointing depends on the fact if there is a second one, 
which is not the way as direct manipulation works. 
We handle these natural gestural communication by 
the following steps. 
? The input control checks if the speech channel 
is active. 
? If speech is not active it waits a short time until 
timeout. 
? If there is a second gesture before timeout it 
waits again a short time. 
? Otherwise the interpretation module is called 
for monomodal gesture interpretation. 
? The interpretation module proceeds this input 
like a sequence of names, perhaps after a clari- 
fication dialog to resolve ambiguous reference. 
8.4 Are Temporal  Relat ions necessary for 
the Resolut ion of  Deictic Expressions 
\[Huls 1996\] proposes instead of analysing temporal 
relation to solve the problem of parallel gestures by 
incrementally parsing and resolving deictic expres- 
sions. We think that approach will not work with 
spoken input and in certain cases will also not work 
for text input. 
Active and Passive Gestures 51 
1. With spoken input the deictic expressions con- 
tained in the utterance can be analysed in general 
only after all deictic gestures are performed, because 
speech recognizers do not provide incremental input. 
Therefore the temporal order has to be accounted 
for. 
2. A deictic gesture may be refer to an object, 
that is not of appropriate type by an error of the 
user. From the temporal synchronization f deictic 
expressions and deictic gestures, we infer, that this 
gesture was intend to communicate he referent of 
the deictic expression. But if we apply anaphora res- 
olution methods, it is very likely that we exclude by 
type considerations the referent of the gesture from 
the set of possible referents of the deictic phrase. 
Perhaps we may instead find some other referent, 
from which we could now by temporal consideration, 
that it is not a possible referent. 
3. If deictic gestures are used as in section 8.3 
Deictic Pointing Gestures as Autonumuos Commu- 
nicative Acts, it is obvious that we need the temporal 
order of the gestural events for interpretation. This 
argument applies also to elliptic utterances as (4). 
? (4) "mit der U-Bahn" ("by tube") ~, /~ 
In (4) we must now the order of the gestures to dis- 
tribute the referent in the right order to the argu- 
ments the route planning task. 
9 Open Quest ion  
As mentioned in section 8 Reference Phenomena in 
MOFA and TALKY some active objects in TALKY 
could appropriately be used for deictic reference. If
the user opens a day-sheet in the calendar by manip- 
ulation and defines an appointment, without spec- 
ifying a day, by speech, TALKY will schedule the 
appointment to the day, opened by the user. The 
effect is the same as with an deictical reference to 
a passive representation f the day under considera- 
tion. 
? (5) "Urlaub von dann/~ bis dann. /~" ("Holi- 
days from then to then") 
In (5) it is doubtful, if the user really wants to open 
the two day-sheets he is referring to. Is there a solu- 
tion for this problem, when you have a touchscreen 
as input device? Does the problem mean, that we 
must use or invent other gestural input technics?
