I .  Amon~ the various traditions established in computer 
processing of natural language during the twenty-odd years 
of research the understanding thet any such processing is to 
be done sequentially has a special status. 
Even the most advanced natural language processing 
systems employ the sequential mode as a necessary evil, or 
do not even consider it an evil due to the ostensible lack 
of alternatives; thus, for instance, such well-known systems 
as SAM, PAM, ELI /cf. e.g. Schank and Riesbeck, 1981/, PHRAN 
/cf. e.g. Arens, 1981/ or PARSIFAL /see e.g. Marcus, 1979/ 
are all based on sequentionslity. 
The recent advances in the VLSI technology suggest 
%her a re-evaluation of this tradition is in order. Indeed, 
non-sequential "parallel ~ methods start emerging. In the 
field of AI one could mention, for example, Kornfeld's 
(1979, 1981) work in problem solving or the approach of 
HEARSAY-II (see Erman et el., 1980) to speech processing. The 
word parallelism seems even to turn gradually into a current 
"buzz-word" in the AI community. Note that the meaning of 
this word still remains largely loose. Thus, Phillips and 
Hendler (1981) snggest a system of several tss___~k-oriented 
- 186  - 
processors  working in  para l le l .  
2. A d i f fe rent  and a more powerfu l  approach to para l le l  
p rocess ing  of  natura l  language i s  suggested here :  in 's teed of  
funct iona l  d i s t r ibut ion  we suggest  para l le l  d i s t r ibut ion  of  
input  stream e lements ;  a p rocessor  i s  ass igned to avery  i tem 
of  input  and each such processor  i s  prov ided with the same 
sof tware  package, so that  a l l  p rocesses  w i th in  a cer ta in  
group become equal  in  s ta tus  and modus operand i .  (Note that  
th i s  a l so  inc reases  the sys tem's  re l iab i l i ty ,  s ince  even in  
the un l i ke ly  case of  fa i lu re  of  n-1 processes  the remain ing 
one w i l l  accompl ish the task  by i t se l f ,  in  the sequent ia l  
mod ? o~ 
Our approach to para l le l i sm i s  based on the phenomenon 
of  loca l i ty .  Cur rent ly  we apply i t  to const ruc t ing  a syntact -  
i c  parsing system for s subset of English, as e simple case 
of natural language processing. 
3. Let us cons ider  a text  as a vector  made up of  d i sc re -  
te  elements wi: 
T = /w0,  wl ,  . . . ,  Wn/ .  
Being fed  with T a cer ta in  Natura l  Laugue~e Processor  (NLP) 
produces a structure of the form S(T) = /v0, Vl, ..., Vm/, 
where vj can be of various nature: words in the object lang- 
uage and/or word~ and symbols in a metalangua~e and/or vari- 
ous kinds of delimiters. 
Let D(Vj) be the minimal subset of T determining v~ in 
the sense that information carried in the elements of th~s 
subset is necessary end sufficient for outputting vj by the 
NLP. Let gj be the index of the leftmost element of D(v.) in 
the string T, and Hi, the index of the rightmost one (e.?g. 
if D(v~) = /w3, ws, w10/ then g~ = 3 and hj = 10). We now de- 
fine the important notion of locality. Locality of an output 
element v;j i s  l ( vS) :  , - h . i -g~ = ~ ;  
hj hj 
- 187  - 
This funct ion  has a number of in teres t ing  proper t ies .  I f  an 
output  element v~ depends on exact ly  one element wi, then i t s  
locality is unity, the highest possible value. On the other 
hand, if a certain v k depends on ? large range of input elem- 
ents, then i t s  loca l i ty  i s  c lose to zero.  Comparir~ para l le l  
and sequent ia l  prooessinE we show that  the ra t io  of the t ime 
necessary  to produce an output  element in  para l le l  mode to 
that  of the sequent ia l  mode s t r i c t ly  depends on the loca l i ty  
of th i s  e lement.  Moreover, the re la t ive  time ga in  of para l le l  
p rocess in8  as regards sequent ia l  process ing i s  exact ly  the 
g iven  e lement ' s  loca l i ty .  In other  words, the greater  the 
~egate  loca l i ty  of e lements in  a cer ta in  text ,  the more 
benefit there is in its parallel processing. Such is the in- 
trinsic connection between the notion of locality and the per- 
formance of a system based on para l le l  p rocess ing .  
4. The process of implementat ion s tar ts  with f ind ing  
c lus ters  of h~h loca l i ty  in  the text .A t  th i s  s t~e we prove 
the fo l low ing  
.Proposition. NPs, .VPs and PPs of English are highly local. 
On this basis we proceed to build a system of parallel pars- 
i r~  fo r  ~ l iah .  In  i t s  p resent  form the system cons is ts  of 
three  modules: a morphologica l  and two syntact i c  ones.  The 
resu l t  of the f i r s t  stage i s  a set  of se ts  of d i s t ionary  en-  
t r ies  fo r  every input  word, which determines the syntact i c  
c lasses  to which the input  words may in  pr inc ip le  be long.  A 
~.ammar fo r  each processor  et  the f i r s t  syntact i c  stage of 
ana lys i s  i s  presented as a tab le  which ind icates  a l l  the cor -  
rec t  t r iads  of syntact i c  c lass  members in  the subset  of E r~ l -  
i sh  We are ana lyz ing .  This means that  th i s  stnge i s  devoted 
to f ind ing  the s ta tes  of compat ib i l i ty  between the "neigh-  
bouts"  in  the input  s t r ing .  I t  te rminates  when a l l  the poss ib -  
le  t r iads  have been checked, produces cand idates  fo r  cor rec t  
parses ( i f  any) and t rans fers  them to the second syntact i c  
stage whose task i s  a /  to car ry  out a l l  k inds  of agreement 
- 188  - 
and completeness  tes ts  (e .g .  the sub jec t -pred icate  number 
agreement and the presence  of  a t  leas t  one verb in  the sent -  
ence,  reap . )  and b /  to  bu i ld  one or  more representat ions  of  
the parse(s )  (e .g .  a const i tuent  t ree  and a pred icate - ro le  
s t ruc ture) .  This  modular framework fac i l i ta tes  the  add i t ion  
of  new s tages  to the system, such as one or  more semant ic  
s tages  and an in ferenc i r~ mechanism (prov ided  a world i s  
de f ined)  ? 
The coBun icat ion  between separate  s tages  of  ana lys i s  
i s  accompl ished g loba l ly ,  and here  a secondary  para l le l i sm,  
th i s  t ime the funct iona l  one (o f .  Ph i l l i ps  and Hendler ,  op. 
c i t . ) - can  be implemented.
