Limits on the human sentence generator 
Anthony S. Kroch

The problem of language generation is the problem of translating communicative intent into linguistic form. 
As such, it implicates the entire richness and complexity of human cognition because, to a close approximation, 
whatever a person can conceive, (s)he can express in language. Computational approaches togeneration have, 
therefore, tightly concentrated onworking out, in conjunction with the linguistic disciplines of discourse analysis 
and pragmatics, the regularities linking communicative intent o linguistic form. In this paper, however, we will 
address adifferent problem; namely, the limits on the capacity of the human language generation mechanism to
translate preverbal messages into sentences ofnatural language. Often functional studies of human communicative 
competence give the impression that people are infinitely subtle and flexible in their ability to use form to signal 
meaning and intent. But so long as we assume that human behavior is ultimately reduceable to the output of a 
machine, however complex, it must be the case that there are limits to the competence we are trying to model. If 
we can find these limits and characterize them theoretically, we will make a contribution to the study of human 
cognition and will help to circumscribe the problem of language generation by computer. While it is certainly too 
early in the development of linguistic science to expect ageneral characterization f the limits on human sentence 
generation, we hope to show in the brief discussion to follow that some evidence as to their nature is available and 
that it is reasonable tohope for progress from future empirical work. 
1. Degrees of difficulty in language processing. 
From the perspective of those of us who would like to develop acomputational theory of human language, 
one of the most puzzling features of people's linguistic behavior is that not all linguistic forms are equally easy for 
them to process. Moreover, these variations in difficulty cannot be translated into simple differences in the length 
of time it takes to process different forms, for speakers regularly make errors sensitive to difficulty in processing 
utterances, both in production and perception. The occurrence of such errors must follow in some way from the 
finiteness of the computational resources of human beings and from the time constraints under which processing 
occurs; and accounting for the distribution of such errors poses an obvious challenge to the theory of language use. 
Of course, some errors, like certain garden path effects in sentence parsing, occur every time the relevant linguistic 
213 
environment occurs; and one can quite easily structure a processing algorithm so that it deterministically produces 
such failures. Indeed, the work on deterministic parsing (Marcus 1980) has shown that one can use the patterning of 
these rrors to choose among competing theories of processing. Other mistakes, however, do not occur every time a 
given environment appears; but there are stochastic regularities in their distribution. These errors may pose the 
biggest challenge to computational linguistics and may provide the biggest opportunity for deepening our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying sentence processing by human beings. 
One example of the sort of error that occurs with measurable frequency in the production of spontaneous 
utterances in English is the use of resumptive pronouns in relative clauses. Consider, for instance, the following 
examples which we collected in the course of a recent study of the syntax of relative clauses used in speech (Kroch 
1980): 
(1) a. ??I was praying for a lady that she lived near my sister. 
b. ??let's get the Babar book, the one that B's gonna read it. 
c. ??Frank had an operation on Friday which we just found out about it. 
d. ??You could have a lock on your door that you give your undergraduates a key to it. 
e. ??I have the ones that she felt she couldn't do anything with ~hem. 
In each of these cases the relative clause sounds odd because apronoun appears in a position where English requires a
gap or 'empty category'. Of course, there are certain environments, like those in (2) below, in which resumptive 
pronouns are more acceptable because the grammar of English does not permit a gap in the position of the pronoun: 
(2) a. People are coming out with symptoms that the doctors don't know what ~hey are. 
b. YU bring a bottle of that stuff that you and I are the only ones that like it. 
Whether these latter cases hould be allowed by the grammar or classed as ungrammatical with the examples in (1) is 
not clear; in any event our concern is with the clearly unacceptable cases, which, somewhat surprisingly, occur with 
measurable frequency in speech. We found in our study that about 1% of relative clauses in spontaneous natural 
discourse contained resumptive pronouns. Why these pronouns hould occur is, of course, hard to determine; but it 
is possible to construct a plausible mechanism for generating them that is worthy of further investigation. Thus, 
consider asentence generating algorithm (e.g., that in MacDonald 1980) under which relative clause gaps are created 
by zeroing a message element under identity with the head of the relative clause being produced (Kroch 1981). If 
that zeroing is subject o random failure, then the identical element will occasionally appear in the output string. It 
will usually be a pronoun, because the mechanism responsible for pronominalization will recognize the repeated 
214 
message element as a second reference to the discourse ntity that the head of the relative clause points to. Of 
course, since pronominaiization is not obligatory, we might expect o find cases in which the resumptive element is 
a full NP rather than a pronoun; and such examples, in fact, also occur. The relative clause in (3) below is one such 
case: 
(3) ??In the middle of the country is a high density area that most of the people come from that area. 
It is interesting to note that under a production algorithm that employs zeroing of an identical element rather 
than movement of the relativized NP to the beginning of the clause, there is no need to fully plan the syntax of a 
relative clause before beginning to send a partially formulated clause to the output device that turns the syntactic 
structure into speech. In particular, the syntactic position of the element to be zeroed need not be calculated because 
the element will be zeroed as it is encountered. If the conditions for zeroing of the identical element are not met, 
generation can simply proceed; and a resumptive pronoun or NP will appear. Just this seems to happen in natural 
spoken English in cases where leaving a gap would violate the conditions on empty categories. If we say that 
zeroing of the identical element isexplicitly blocked in these cases, then essentially the same mechanism that 
explains the sporadic occurrence of clauses like those in (1) above will account for why spoken English commonly 
exhibits clauses like those in (2). In this respect, English appears to differ from languages like German or the 
Slavic languages, which must have a somewhat different algorithm for producing relative clauses. Because German 
and Slavic relative pronouns are marked for case, the speakers of those languages cannot begin to send a relative 
clause to the output device until the syntactic position of the gap is fixed since it is this syntactic position which 
determines the case of the relative pronoun. Under these circumstances, it should be much easier for speakers to 
avoid producing relative clauses with gaps in the wrong position in these languages than in English; and hence 
resumptive pronouns hould be less common in speech in these languages. While no fh-m evidence on the frequency 
of resumptive pronouns in German or similar languages i available, experienced observers seem to agree that the 
sorts of resumptive pronouns that are heard in English do not occur with any noticeable regularity in these other 
languages. In contrast, western European languages that share with English the property of having minimal case 
marking on their relativizers (e.~.. the Romance lanuages and the Scandinavian languages) do exhibit use of 
resumptive pronouns in speech. 
215 
If the random occurrence of resumptive pronouns in spoken English relatives is due to the structure of the 
production algorithm and to a characteristic way in which it can fail, then it should be of interest to find out under 
what conditions failure is more or less likely to occur. Information on this point can be obtained by statistical 
comparison of randomly sampled corpora of relative clauses with and without resumptive pronouns. When we 
carried out such a study on a corpus of 500 relative clauses containing resumptive pronouns collected from naturally 
occurring discourse and 5000 clauses without resumptive pronouns collected from tape recorded sociolinguistic 
interviews, we found that one of the most significant factors influencing the likelihood of appearance ofa 
resumptive pronoun was the degree of embedding of the gap position. Thus, if the gap position was in a 
subordinate clause within the relative clause (as in (le) above) it was more likely to be filled with a resumptive 
pronoun than if it was in the highest clause of the relative (as in (la)-(ld)). Even more strikingly, in simple 
sentence r lative clauses, the likelihood of occurrence of a resumptive pronoun increased with each increase in the 
number of phrasal nodes on the path between the head of the clause and the gap position. In other words, subject 
position resumptive pronouns like (la) were less likely than direct object resumptive pronouns like (lb), and these 
were less likely than resumptive pronoun objects of verb phrase prepositions (as in (lc)). The most likely position 
for the occurrence of resumptive pronoun was the position of complement toa direct object NP (as in (ld)), this 
being the position with the longest path between the gap position and the antecedent. The following table gives 
probability weights for each of degree of embedding calculated for the sample we analyzed using the VARBRUL 2S 
program for multivariate logit analysis (Rousseau and Sankoff 1978):

pronoun. (Weights lie between 0.0 and 1.0, with higher weights indicating increased likelihood of 
occurrence of a resurnptive pronoun.) 
216 
The challenge posed by these results, which from a statistical point of view are quite robust, is to construct a model 
of the sentence generation process in which stochastic effects of complexity have a natural place. 
2. Limits to planning. 
One of the limits on language processing that follows from the time and resource constraints under which it 
operates i that he planning of sentences ingeneration cannot take account of every conceivably relevant fact about 
the discourse situation. At some point decisions must be made which cut short he planning process. If this were 
not so, we would expect, among other things, the forms of sentences used in discourse to be determined by 
arbitrarily complex predicates on prior discourse context, which certainly seems not to be true. Saying that there 
must be limits to planning, however, is a great deal easier than showing what these limits are because of the great 
expressiveness and flexibililty of human discourse competence. Nevertheless, it is possible to find evidence that 
certain mechanical effects - that is, effects not related to meaning or appropriateness - influence syntactic choices by 
speakers. For instance, in an interesting statistical study of the use of the agentless passive in spontaneous 
discourse, Weiner and Labov (1983) found that an important factor influencing speaker's choices between active 
sentences with generalized subjects like (4) and agentless passives like (5) was whether they had used a passive 
sentence in the preceding 5 clauses: 
(4) They broke into the liquor cabinet. 
(5) The liquor cabinet got broken into. 
Weiner and Labov suggested that his result was a 'mechanical' syntactic effect which showed the limits of 
considerations of discourse function in determining syntactic usage in spontaneous speech. However, while these 
results and interpretation were intriguing, itwas clear to students of discourse function that alternative explanations 
of the so-called mechanical effect, which might be considered a 'priming' effect in syntax akin to the well-known 
lexical priming effect, were possible. In particular, itwas possible that the effect was an artifact of discourse 
functional effects not properly controlled for in the study. In order to test the validity of the Weiner and Labov 
finding, Dominique Estival and I planned astudy in which the relevant discourse ffects due to topicality of logical 
subject and object, repetition, aspect, and other factors were explicitly controlled for. We also decided to test whether 
the priming effect, if it did exist, was sensitive to the difference between verbal and adjectival passives ince the two 
forms of passive, illustrated below in (6) and (7), had been argued convincingly not to be the same syntactic 
217 
construction (Wasow 1977): 
(6) John was fired by his boss. 
(7) John was interested in music. 
The results of a statistical study of a corpus of more than 600 passive sentences and a roughly equal sized random 
subsample of active sentences ( ee Estival 1982, 1985) showed that the priming effect was orthogonal to the 
discourse function effects controlled for and that it cleanly differentiated verbal from adjectival passives. Note that 
the probabilistic weights in table 2 below are highest along the main diagonal, which shows that verbal passives are 
priming verbal passives and adjectival passives are priming adjectival passives, but that verbal and adjectival 
passives are not priming one another. 
Likelihood of 
Active Verbal passive adjectival passive 
Clause type found in 
preceding 5clauses: 
active only .44 .26 .30 
verbal passive .22 .56 .22 
adjectival passive .32 .21 .47 
Table 2: Effect of the occurrence of preceding verbal and adjectival passives on the likelihood 
o f  a passive. 
From these results we concluded that the mere fact that a speaker uses a construction seems to increase the likelihood 
that (s)he will use it again and hence that the use of syntactic onstructions is conditioned, not just by discourse 
appropriateness but also by their 'accessibility' orqevel of psychological ctivation' for the sentence production 
mechanism (see Bock 1982 for further discussion). The fact that he priming effect differentiates verbal from 
adjectival passives uggests, moreover, that the identity criteria for priming reflect quite abstract linguistic 
properties. 
Another ecent study of ours which points out both the flexibility of human sentence planning and the limits 
on that flexibility is a quantitative study of 700 transitive particle verbs. We investigated the factors which 
influenced the position of the direct object in these sentences, which, as the examples in (8) and (9) below illustrate, 
may be either before or after the particle: 
(8) The boy put the dog down. 
(9) The boy called up his friend. 
218 
Two of the factors which heavily influenced the relative order of direct object and particle, already known to us from 
a previous tudy (Kroch and Small 1978), were the length of the direct object NP and the semantic contribution of 
the particle to the sentence meaning. The first effect was that longer object NP's were more likely to appear after the 
particle than shorter ones. The semantic effect was that particles which made an independent contribution to the 
meaning of the sentence, as, for example, in (8) above, were more likely to occur in post-object position (where 
equivalent prepositional phrases occur) than purely idiomatic particles like the one in (9). These effects were exactly 
as expected, given the results of our previous tudy. We were curious to know, however, whether the two effects 
were independent of one another; in particular, we wanted to know what happened incases where the length effect 
and the semantic effect cut against one another, the relevant case being that of sentences with long direct objects and 
non-idiomatic particles. The following table shows gives the cross-tabulation f these two factors: 
Semantic type of particle 
Length of direct object NP 
1-2 words 3-4 words 5 or more 
Idiomatic: 
particle before object NP 114 45 45 
total cases 240 62 47 
percent particle before NP 48 73 96 
Compositional: 
particle before object NP 79 18 9 
total cases 263 65 13 
percent particle before NP 30 28 69 
Table 3: Crosstabulation f particle type by direct object length, showing effects on order 
of particle and NP and on number of cases of each type. 
It is obvious from inspection that he ceU which crosses non-idiomatic particles with direct objects five or more 
words long is much smaller than expected. The fast and second columns are roughly the same size in each row; but 
in the third column, which represents he figures for long NP's, the cell with the figures for idiomatic particles is 
three times as large as the cell representing the non-idiomatic ones. It appears, therefore, that speakers are avoiding 
the use of the verb-particle construction i the case where the conditioning factors favor opposite orderings of 
particle and object NP. Of more interest for our present discussion, however, is that those sentences which do occur 
in this ceU show exactly the intermediate frequency of object last order that we would expect if the two effects were 
independent of one another. This result is consistent with a model of the production of these sentences in which the 
decision on how to order the particle and direct object was unaffected by the decision as to whether to use the verb- 
particle construction atall. It is as though the production mechanism were organized into a simple decision tree in 
219 
which the decision as to whether to use a particle verb is made first, apparently on the basis of information about he 
semantic relationship between verb and particle and about he qaeaviness' (perhaps the amount of descriptive content) 
of the object NP, and then the particle object ordering decision is made independently. To the extent hat such a 
simple organization of decisions for sentence production, without complex interactions among levels, can be 
justified by further work, it will be possible to construct a more constrained model of the generation process; and we 
will have a better idea of the structural characteristics ofthe system within which discourse functional considerations 
have their effects.
