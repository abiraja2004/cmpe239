Usnal plan-based approaches to speech act interpreta- 
tiott require that perib~zning a speech act implies its suc- 
ces:s. These approaches are thus useless for describing 
failing illecut~onary or perlocutionary acts. We propose 
an t~lternatiw~ plan-based view of speech acts centered 
around the notion of trying to do - as opposed to actually 
do ing-  an action. This approach is contrasted with that 
of I'errault which aims to overcome similar problems. 
1. :~ntroduction 
The., plan-based approach to the analysis of natural an- 
gu~bge dialogues, inspired by the work of Austin \[Austin 
62\] and Searle \[Searle 75\] \[Searle/Vanderveken 85\], has 
dominated most of the dialogue-oriented NLU research 
since the late seventies, cf. \[Allen 79\], \[Allen 84\], \[Cohen 
78\], \[CohenfPerrault 791\], \[Perrault/Allen 80\], \[Litman 
85\]~ \[Pollack 86\]. It is characterized by the following as- 
sumptions: 
o Utterances are actions planned and executed by the 
speaker to satisfy some of her goals. 
? Speech acts can be represented as operators in plan- 
ning systems such as STRIPS \[Fikes/Nilsson 71\] 
which relate actions to their preconditions and ef- 
fects. 
$ The speaker's beliefs and intentions can be inferred 
by observing her utterances. 
Sew~ral variants of describing actions in planning sys- 
tems have been proposed in the lkerature. We will use 
the tbllowing c, onventions: an action is defined by a quin- 
tuple comprising 
? an ac t ion  descr ip t ion ,  e.g. (pick-up ?x) in the 
blocks world domain, 
o a set of precondit ions,  e.g. (on-table ?x), 
? the add-llst, a set of propositions which become true 
once the action has been performed, e.g. (holding ?x), 
? the delete-l ist,  a set of propositions which are no 
longer true after the action has been pertbrmed, e.g. 
(on-table ?x), 
? the body, a list of lower-level actions comprising the 
described action, e.g. the movements of a robot arm 
:in the blocks world domain. 
1Thi:~ paper was written by the first author but describes work 
jointly undertaken with the second. 
The relationship between these elements is interpreted 
as condit ional generation (following \[Goldman 70\], 
\[Pollack 86\]): the execution of the body actions generates 
the defined action (and thus its effects as described in 
the add- and delete-list) iffthe preconditions hold. 
All three acts involved in making an utterance, the lo- 
cutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts, may 
fail: the addressee may not hear the utterance, she may 
not understand the speaker, or she may not react accord- 
ing to the speaker's intentions. 
But when actions are defined in terms of their effects, 
a failure to achieve the effects implies a corresponding 
failure to perlbrm the action. When I try to drive a nail 
into the wall with a hammer, and fail, then I have not 
driven a nail into the wall. Similarly, when I utter a 
declarative sentence, and fail to convince the hearer, I
have failed to perform the intended perlocutionary act. 
When the addressee does not understand me, 1 have not 
even performed an illocutionary act, and so on. Regard- 
less of the level of description there's always the chance 
that the action may fail, i.e. that there was no action. 
Even granted that we could capture practically all of the 
relevant cases by describing the action on the level of, 
say, producing sounds, there's no way to relate that level 
of description to the intentions of the speaker. 
This is a rather unfortunate r sult, as we take the ob- 
served action as the starting point for inferring the 
speakers beliefs and intentions - -  which may well be the 
same, regardless of the speech act's success. Clearly, an 
approach facilitating a uniform treatment of succeeding 
and failing speech acts would be most welcome. 
There are two ways to cope with failing speech acts. 
The first amounts to weakening the inference from the 
performance ofan action to its effects being achieved, i.e. 
making it defeasible. The other solution is to describe ac- 
tions in terms not presupposing their successful execu- 
tion. The former approach was proposed by Perrault 
\[Perrault 87\] and further efined by Appelt and Konolige 
\[Appelt/Konolige 88\], while the latter is the one we use. 
2. Perrault 's approach 
Perrault describes the way assertions influence peoples 
beliefs by distinguishing between axioms describing 
strong evidence for beliefs, and default rules capturing 
the effects of (sometimes failing) speech acts. The most 
important axioms are: 
179 
Memory: I'- Bx,tP ~ Bx, t+l\]~x,tp 
Persistence: l -  Bx, t+lBx,tP:3 Bx,t+lP 
Obseroability: ~ DOx,ta & DOy,tObs(x)D 
By,t+lDOx~ta 
Agents remember their previous beliefs (memory), they 
stick to what they believe they believed previously 
(persistence). If an agent observes another agent, she 
knows of all actions the observed agent performs (ob- 
servability). Memory and persistence together imply that 
agents never forget and never change their beliefs. Ob- 
serving is regarded as the only dependable mode of ac- 
quiring new knowledge. 
Speech acts are considered to be a weaker kind of evi- 
dence, and thus the effect of uttering a declarative sen- 
tence is modelled by default rules: 
Declarative rule: DOx,t(p.) ~ Bx, tp 
Belief transfer: Bx,tBy, tp~ 13x,tp 
i.e., an agent believes what she thinks other agents be- 
lieve, provided this is consistent with her previous be- 
liefs (belief transfer ule). Uttering a declarative sentence 
implies by default hat the speaker believes its proposi- 
tional content (declarative rule). 
For the most part, this theory makes correct predic- 
tions. For example: 
? The hearer will not be convinced by an assertion if it 
contradicts one of her previous beliefs. 
? A liar will not be convinced by her own lie, but may 
still believe that she successfully deceived the un- 
suspecting hearer. 
In both of these cases do the axioms (memory and persis- 
tence) override the defaults. 
However, adopting Perrault's olution has the unfor- 
tunate side effect of depriving speech act rules of their 
definitional import: an action may be executed without 
its effects being achieved. What are the effects anyway? 
According to Perrault, uttering a declarative sentence 
implies (by default) that the speaker believes its proposi- 
tional content ~ this can hardly be thought of as an ef- 
fect of the speech act, and it isn't a precondition, either. 
As neither the effects of an assertion or its constituting 
body actions are specified, this leaves assertions as a pri- 
mitive, 'undefined notion. But what is a theory of asser- 
tions worth if it does not say what an assertion is or 
what would count as "making an assertion"?. 
There's also another, more technical problem: when a 
speaker has no belief whatsoever about P, she can con- 
vince herself that P is true by simply uttering "P.': as it's 
perfectly consistent for her to believe P, both of the 
declarative rule and the belief transfer ule are applica- 
ble and will lead to her believing P. Thus, a speaker may 
convince herself of anything she is incompetent of. 
As Appelt and Konolige have shown, this deficiency 
can be overcome by employing a more sophisticated 
nonmonotonic theory, cf. \[Appelt/Konolige 88\]. But is 
this added complexity really necessary? Even though 
Appelt and Konolige claim (without proof) that there can 
be no specification of the effects of an assertion that ap- 
plies under all possible circumstances, we aim to achieve 
just that. Instead of assuming that speech acts some- 
times fail to achieve their normal effects, we admit that 
in fact no (successful) speech act was performed in these 
cases and relate the speakers behaviour to the intended 
act by some other means, namely by making explicit the 
notion of"tlTing'. 
3. Trying to do things with words 
The missing link between an agent's intentions and her 
(sometimes unsuccessful) performance of the intended 
action is the notion of"trying~: when an agent has a pre- 
sent directed intention to A (cf. \[Bratman 87\]), she will 
try to do A, and - -  if the preconditions for doing A are 
sat is f ied-  she will thereby do A. Fig. 1 illustrates this: 
(S  intendsA) 
leads to 
in 
Fig. 2: From intention to action 
The try-to-do level of description provides an ideal basis 
for analyzing the agent's intentions, as such an analysis 
is independent ofthe action's uccess. 
The interpretation process uses a default rule to de- 
termine whether an action was executed successfully: 
F rom try-to-do to do: If it is known that an 
agent S tries-to-do A in the situation SITA2 , then 
assume (by default) that S does A in SIT'A. 
The consequence of this conclusion is modelled by an- 
other (non default) rule: 
F rom act ion to effect: If an agent S does A in 
the situation SITA, then the preconditions of A 
are satisfied in a situation SITp temporally in- 
cluding SIT A (because otherwise it would have 
been impossible to do A), and the effects of A are 
satisfied in a situation SIT E temporally met by 
SITA. 
If this conclusion contradicts a previous belief, the de- 
fault assumption that S had successfully done A is de- 
feated. 
Here lies one of the main differences between 
Perrault's approach and our's: where he uses defaults for 
the inference from the performance of an action to its 
effects, we use defaults for the inference from try-to-do to 
do. rFhe results are similar, but this move allows us to 
2perrault associates belief~ and other propositional ttitudes with 
time points, whereas we use situations as partial descriptions of
the world over a time interval. For the purpose of this paper we 
deliberatly slur over this distinction as it is unimportant for the is- 
sue at hand. 
180  
use strict definitions of speech acts. For example, the 
,!~peech act assertion is defined as follows: 
Aetion~ Assert P (in SITu) 
Pre~ondi t ionm The hearer believes that the 
speaker is sincere and competent in SIT U. 
Add-list: The hearer believes that the speaker 
believes P. 
Body: Utter ~P." (in SIT v) 
':\[~e effect (as specified in the add-list) is what we take to 
be the fllocutionary point: to achieve that the hearer be- 
lieves that the speaker believes the propositional con- 
~nt.  
Let us assume the following scenario: a speaker S ut- 
4~ers "P." (referring to a situation SIT R) in the situation 
SIT v. Sincerity and competence of the speaker can be 
judged by an observer O (who may be identical to the 
~!~peaker) using the following rules: 
Ins incer i ty  o f  a speaker  in ut ter ing an asser- 
t ion: If it is known to O that for some situation 
SIT 1 temporally included in SITR, S believes P to 
be false in SIT1, then O knows that S is insincere 
in SITu. 
I ncompetence  of a speaker  in u t te r ing  an 
assert ion:  If it is known to O that for some situa- 
tion SIT 2 temporally including SITR, S has no be- 
lief regarding the truth of P in SIT2, then O 
knows that S is incompetent inSITu, 
To complete the picture, we use a belief transfer ule 
quite similar to the one Perrault uses, except that it 
~flocks inferences of the form 
BxByBxp ~ BxBxp -~ BxP 
which we think are unreasonable: an agent does not 
~dopt he beliefs she thinks other people have of her - -  
at least not automatically. Fig. 2 illustrates the overall 
:~tructure of the interpretation process, which is the 
~mme for the speaker, the hearer, or any incidental over- 
hearer:

Fig. 2: Interpreting an assertion 
The thick gray line encloses the aspects of the interpre- 
~;ation process described in this paper. 
An example: the speaker S and the hearer H original- 
ly beth believe that -P. There are no other relevant be- 
liefs. When S utters "P.', 
? S recognizes herself to be insincere and thus her 
assertion - -  as an utterance to herse l f -  fails. On 
the other hand, it is consistent for S to believe that 
H will take her to be competent and sincere by de- 
fault, and that as an utterance to H the assertion 
will succeed, i.e. BsBHBsp and thus BsBtl p. 
? H believes S to be competent and sincere by default 
and therefore the illocutionary act succeeds as an ut- 
terance to H. H believes that S believes P (BnBsp), 
but sticks to her previous belief that -P. 
As a result, beth S and H will continue to believe -~P, but 
will also (wrongly) attribute to the other a belief that P. 
If instead the speaker had no belief about P initially, she 
would judge herself incompetent and again would not 
trust her own words. 
Determining the speaker's intentions is considerably 
more complex, as it requires earch in a web of action de- 
scriptions linked by (conditionally-) generates and gener. 
ated-by relations. In general, the observed action A o and 
the intended action A x are linked by a path 
Ao generated-by generates A 1 
The separation of the analysis of belief and intentions 
enables a straight-forward interpretation of a speech 
act's effects while offering a sound basis for the subse- 
quent analysis of the speaker's and hearer's intentions. 
4. Intending to try 
We have described trying-to.do A as an intermediate 
step between intending to A and doing A. An agent may 
describe her actions as "doing A" or "trying to do A', and 
the latter will often just reflect her doubts as to whether 
she will succeed. Nevertheless, i fA is an action, then so 
is tryA, and intending to tryA is a genuine intention dis- 
tinct from an intention to A. 
In both cases will the intending agent ry-to-do A, and 
sometimes doA, but even if she fails to do A, she cannot 
fail to try A. Trying A will sometimes have the effects of 
A-ing --  and, if it does, will have caused these effects - -  
but its only necessary result is that A has been tried. 
Therefore, trying A can be successful where A-ing is not. 
For example, I may intend to try to move a heavy log (cf. 
\[Bratman 87:38f\]) while strongly believing I will fail - -  
just to demonstrate hat I cannot move it. This demon- 
stration is successful only if I do not succeed in moving 
the log despite trying real hard to do so. 
Bratman (cf. \[Bratman 87:111ff\]) did not recognize 
the difference between trying.to-do A as a consequence of 
intending toA and trying-to-do A as a consequence of in- 
tending to try A. His term endeavoring (adopted from 
\[Chisholm 76\]) encompasses both cases. This missing 
distinction seems to be responsible for most of the less 
elegant aspects of Bratman's theory, especially the way 
he relates acting with an intention to acting intentional- 
ly. On the "Simple View", ml agents doing A intentionally 
implies her intention to A. Bratman dismisses this 
Simple View on the grounds that an agent will some- 
times act intentionally without (in a strong sense) in- 
tending the action. 
181 
Consider the following example taken from \[Bratman 
87:137\]: Bratman very much wants to mar~ T Susan, and 
he equally much wants to marry Jane. He knows he can- 
not marry both but is unable to resolve the conflict. 
Therefore he hopes that Susan and Jane will settle the 
issue for him: he tries to persuade both women to marry 
him, expecting that just one of the two will agree. This 
kind of behaviour seems perfectly rational ~ though 
probably immoral - -  but according to Bratman's trong 
consistency requirement for intentions he should not in- 
tend to persuade Susan and Jane to marry him when he 
knows he cemnot marry both (and thus cannot achieve 
both perlocutionary acts). Bratman concludes that he in- 
tentionally persuades Susan as well as Jane, without 
endorsing the inconsistent intention to persuade both. 
Instead he proposes "guiding desires ~as a weaker kind 
of intentions guiding an agents conduct. 
We can offer a simpler solution: while sticking to the 
Simple View, we agree that it is irrational for Bratman 
to intend to persuade two women to marry him. It is not 
(necessarily) irrational, however, to intend to try to per- 
suade both women, believing that at most one of the two 
will agree, and such an intention will lead to the same 
behaviour towards Susan and Jane as an intention to 
persuade them simpliciter would. The distinction be- 
tween stronger and weaker kinds of intentions is there- 
fore unnecessary. 
Returning to the issue of speech act interpretation, 
consider the following case: Mary is tried for a crime she 
did not commit. She has all the evidence against her, 
though, and thus she is convinced no one will believe her 
if she pleads "Not guilty", or even trust her she believes 
it herself. Unfortunately, Mary cannot rationally intend 
to assert she is innocent when she is certain of her fail- 
ure, so what could she do? Again, the intention to try 
comes to the rescue: poor Mary may rationally intend to 
try to assert she is innocent (as she has every reason to 
do so), and this intention will lead to her uttering "Not 
guilty ~. 
5. What has been achieved? 
We have developed a descriptive framework to provide a 
uniform account of successful as well as unsuccessful 
speech acts. The notion of trying-to.do an action is appli- 
cable in both cases and can serve as the basis for ana- 
lyzing the ~,peaker's intentions. Our theory makes all the 
correct predictions that Perrault's theory makes, but it 
does additionally handle the cases which are problematic 
for Perrault's account. 
MEDIAS, a module for speech act interpretation 
along the lines of the approach presented here has been 
implemented using the expert system shell HARES as a 
rapid prototyping tool \[Genzmann 89\]. MEDIAS handles 
assertions as well as yes/no questions, distinguishing in- 
formation-seeking from information-probing questions. 
We are currently investigating the role of natural an- 
guage utterances in initiating, planning, and coordinat- 
ing cooperative behaviour (cf. \[Werner 89\]). This re- 
search will build upon and extend the first prototype of 
the MEDI~LS system.
