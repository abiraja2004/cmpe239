Abstract
This paper presents CUCWeb, a 166 mil-
lion word corpus for Catalan built by
crawling the Web. The corpus has been
annotated with NLP tools and made avail-
able to language users through a flexible
web interface. The developed architecture
is quite general, so that it can be used to
create corpora for other languages.
1 Introduction
CUCWeb is the outcome of the common interest
of two groups, a Computational Linguistics group
and a Computer Science group interested on Web
studies. It fits into a larger project, The Span-
ish Web Project, aimed at empirically studying the
properties of the Spanish Web (Baeza-Yates et al,
2005). The project set up an architecture to re-
trieve a portion of the Web roughly correspond-
ing to the Web in Spain, in order to study its for-
mal properties (analysing its link distribution as a
graph) and its characteristics in terms of pages,
sites, and domains (size, kind of software used,
language, among other aspects).
One of the by-products of the project is a 166
million word corpus for Catalan.1 The biggest
annotated Catalan corpus before CUCWeb is the
CTILC corpus (Rafel, 1994), consisting of about
50 million words.
In recent years, the Web has been increasingly
used as a source of linguistic data (Kilgarriff and
Grefenstette, 2003). The most straightforward ap-
proach to using the Web as corpus is to gather data
online (Grefenstette, 1998), or estimate counts
1Catalan is a relatively minor language. There are
currently about 10.8 million Catalan speakers, similar
to Serbian (12), Greek (10.2), or Swedish (9.3). See
http://www.upc.es/slt/alatac/cat/dades/catala-04.html
(Keller and Lapata, 2003) using available search
engines. This approach has a number of draw-
backs, e.g. the data one looks for has to be known
beforehand, and the queries have to consist of lex-
ical material. In other words, it is not possible
to perform structural searches or proper language
modeling.
Current technology makes it feasible and rela-
tively cheap to crawl and store terabytes of data.
In addition, crawling the data and processing it
off-line provides more potential for its exploita-
tion, as well as more control over the data se-
lection and pruning processes. However, this ap-
proach is more challenging from a technological
viewpoint. 2 For a comprehensive discussion of
the pros and cons of the different approaches to
using Web data for linguistic purposes, see e.g.
Thelwall (2005) and Lu?deling et al (To appear).
We chose the second approach because of the ad-
vantages discussed in this section, and because it
allowed us to make the data available for a large
number of non-specialised users, through a web
interface to the corpus. We built a general-purpose
corpus by crawling the Spanish Web, processing
and filtering them with language-intensive tools,
filtering duplicates and ranking them according to
popularity.
The paper has the following structure: Sec-
tion 2 details the process that lead to the consti-
tution of the corpus, Section 3 explores some of
the exploitation possibilities that are foreseen for
CUCWeb, and Section 4 discusses the current ar-
chitecture. Finally, Section 5 contains some con-
clusions and future work.
2The WaCky project (http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/) aims
at overcoming this challenge, by developing ?a set of tools
(and interfaces to existing tools) that will allow a linguist to
crawl a section of the web, process the data, index them and
search them?.

2 Corpus Constitution
2.1 Data collection
Our goal was to crawl the portion of the Web re-
lated to Spain. Initially, we crawled the set of
pages with the suffix .es. However, this domain
is not very popular, because it is more expensive
than other domains (e.g. the cost of a .com do-
main is about 15% of that of an .es domain), and
because its use is restricted to company names or
registered trade marks.3 In a second phase a dif-
ferent heuristic was used, and we considered that
a Web site was in Spain if either its IP address was
assigned to a network located in Spanish land, or if
the Web site?s suffix was .es. We found that only
16% of the domains with pages in Spain were un-
der .es.
The final collection of the data was carried
out in September and October 2004, using a
commercial piece of software by Akwan (da Silva
et al, 1999). 4 The actual collection was started
by the crawler using as a seed the list of URLs in a
Spanish search engine ?which was a commercial
search engine back in 2000? under the name of
Buscopio. That list covered the major part of the
existing Web in Spain at that time. 5. New URLs
were extracted from the downloaded pages, and
the process continued recursively while the pages
were in Spain ?see above. The crawler down-
loaded all pages, except those that had an identical
URL (http://www.web.es/main/ and
http://www.web.es/main/index.html
were considered different URLs). We retrieved
over 16 million Web pages (corresponding to
over 300,000 web sites and 118,000 domains),
and processed them to extract links and text. The
uncompressed text of the pages amounts to 46
GB, and the metadata generated during the crawl
to 3 GB.
In an initial collection process, a number of dif-
ficulties in the characterisation of the Web of Spain
were identified, which lead to redundancy in the
contents of the collection:
Parameters to a program inside URL addresses.
This makes it impossible to adequately sep-
3In the case of Catalan, additionally, there is a political
and cultural opposition to the .es domain.
4We used a PC with two Intel-4 processors running at 3
GHz and with 1.6 GB of RAM under Red-Hat Linux. For
the information storage we used a RAID of disks with 1.8 TB
of total capacity, although the space used by the collection is
about 50 GB.
5http://www.buscopio.net
arate static and dynamic pages, and may
lead to repeatedly crawl pages with the same
content.
Mirrors (geographically distributed copies of the
same contents to ensure network efficiency).
Normally, these replicas are entire collections
with a large volume, so that there are many
sites with the same contents, and these are
usually large sites. The replicated informa-
tion is estimated between 20% and 40% of
the total Web contents ((Baeza-Yates et al,
2005)).
Spam on the Web (actions oriented to deceive
search engines and to give to some pages a
higher ranking than they deserve in search re-
sults). Recognizing spam pages is an active
research area, and it is estimated that over 8%
of what is indexed by search engines is spam
(Fetterly et al, 2004). One of the strategies
that induces redundancy is to automatically
generate pages to improve the score they ob-
tain in link-based rankings algorithms.
DNS wildcarding (domain name spamming).
Some link analysis ranking functions assign
less importance to links between pages in
the same Web site. Unfortunately, this has
motivated spammers to use several different
Web sites for the same contents, usually
through configuring DNS servers to assign
hundreds or thousands of site names to
the same IP address. Spain?s Web seems
to be quite populated with domain name
spammers: 24 out of the 30 domains with the
highest number of Web sites are configured
with DNS wildcarding (Baeza-Yates et al,
2005).
Most of the spam pages were under the .com
top-level domain. We manually checked the do-
mains with the largest number of sites and pages to
ban a list of them, mostly sites containing pornog-
raphy or collections of links without information
content. This is not a perfect solution against
spam, but generates significant savings in terms
of bandwidth and storage, and allows us to spend
more resources in content-rich Web sites. We also
restricted the crawler to download a maximum of
400 pages per site, except for the Web sites within
.es, that had no pre-established limit.

2.2 Data processing
The processing of the data to obtain the Catalan
corpus consisted of the following steps: language
classification, linguistic filtering and processing,
duplicate filtering and corpus indexing. This sec-
tion details each of these aspects.
We built a language classifier with the Naive
Bayes classifier of the Bow system (Mccallum,
1996). The system was trained with corpora cor-
responding to the 4 official languages in Spain
(Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Basque), as well
as to the other 6 most frequent languages in
the Web (Anonymous, 2000): English, German,
French, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch.
38% of the collection could not be reliably clas-
sified, mostly because of the presence of pages
without enough text, for instance, pages contain-
ing only images or only lists of proper nouns.
Within the classified pages, Catalan was the third
most used language (8% of the collection). As
expected, most of the collection was in Spanish
(52%), but English had a large part (31%). The
contents in Galician and Basque only comprise
about 2% of the pages.
We wanted to use the Catalan portion as a cor-
pus for NLP and linguistic studies. We were not
interested in full coverage of Web data, but in
quality. Therefore, we filtered it using a compu-
tational dictionary and some heuristics in order to
exclude documents with little linguistic relevance
(e.g. address lists) or with a lot of noise (program-
ming code, multilingual documents). In addition,
we performed a simple duplicate filter: web pages
with a very similar content (determined by a hash
of the processed text) were considered duplicates.
The sizes of the corpus (in documents and
words6) after each of the processes are depicted in
Table 1. Note that the two filtering processes dis-
card almost 60% of the original documents. The
final corpus consists of 166 million words from
204 thousand documents.
Its distribution in terms of top-level domains is
shown in Table 2, and the 10 biggest sites in Ta-
6Word counts do not include punctuation marks.
ble 3. Note that the .es domain covers almost
half of the pages and com a quarter, but .org and
.net alo have a quite large share of the pages.
As for the biggest sites, they give an idea of the
content of CUCWeb: they mainly correspond to
university and institutional sites. A similar dis-
tribution can be observed for the 50 biggest sites,
which will determine the kind of language found
in CUCWeb.

The corpus was further processed with CatCG
( `Alex Alsina et al, 2002), a POS-tagger and shal-
low parser for Catalan built with the Connexor
Constraint Grammar formalism and tools.7 CatCG
provides part of speech, morphological features
(gender, number, tense, etc.) and syntactic infor-
mation. The syntactic information is a functional
tag (e.g. subject, object, main verb) annotated at
word level.
Since we wanted the corpus not only to be an
in-house resource for NLP purposes, but also to
be accessible to a large number of users. To that
end, we indexed it using the IMS Corpus Work-
bench tools8 and we built a web interface to it (see
Section 3.1). The CWB includes facilities for in-
dexing and searching corpora, as well as a special
module for web interfaces. However, the size of
the corpus is above the advisable limit for these
tools. 9 Therefore, we divided it into 4 subcorpora

a corpus has to be split into several parts, a good rule of thumb
is to split it in 100M word parts. In his words ?depending on
various factors such as language, complexity of annotations

and indexed each of them separately. The search
engine for the corpus is the CQP (Corpus Query
Processor, one of the modules of the CWB).
Since CQP provides sequential access to doc-
uments we ordered the corpus documents by
PageRank so that they are retrieved according to
their popularity on the Internet.
3 Corpus Exploitation
CUCWeb is being exploited in two ways: on the
one hand, data can be accessed through a web
interface (Section 3.1). On the other hand, the
annotated data can be exploited by theoretical or
computational linguists, lexicographers, transla-
tors, etc. (Section 3.2).
3.1 Corpus interface
Despite the wide use of corpora in NLP, few in-
terfaces have been built, and still fewer are flex-
ible enough to be of interest to linguistic re-
searchers. As for Web data, some initiatives ex-
ist (WebCorp 10, the Linguist?s Search Engine 11,
KWiCFinder 12), but they are meta-interfaces to
search engines. For Catalan, there is a web inter-
face for the CTILC corpus13, but it only allows for
one word searches, of which a maximum of 50 hits
are viewed. It is not possible either to download
search results.
From the beginning of the project our aim was
to create a corpus which could be useful for both
the NLP community and for a more general au-
dience with an interest in the Catalan language.
and how much RAM you have, a larger or smaller size may
give better overall performance.?.

12http://miniappolis.com/KWiCFinder
13http://pdl.iec.es
This includes linguists, lexicographers and lan-
guage teachers.
We expected the latter kind of user not to be fa-
miliar with corpus searching strategies and corpus
interfaces, at least not to a large extent. Therefore,
we aimed at creating a user-friendly web interface
which should be useful for both non-trained and
experienced users.14 Further on, we wanted the
interface to support not only example searches but
also statistical information, such as co-occurrence
frequency, of use in lexicographical work and po-
tentially also in language teaching or learning.
There are two web interfaces to the corpus:
an example search interface and a statistics inter-
face. Furthermore, since the flexibility and expres-
siveness of the searches potentially conflicts with
user-friendliness, we decided to divide the exam-
ple search interface into two modalities: a simple
search mode and an expert search mode.
The simple mode allows for searches of words,
lemmata or word strings. The search can be re-
stricted to specific parts of speech or syntactic
functions. For instance, a user can search for
an ambiguous word like Catalan ?la? (masculine
noun, or feminine determiner or personal pro-
noun) and restrict the search to pronouns. Or look
for word ?traduccions? (?translations?) function-
ing as subject. The advantage of the simple mode
is that an untrained person can use the corpus al-
most without the need to read instructions. If new
users find it useful to use CUCWeb, we expect that
the motivation to learn how to create advanced cor-
pus queries will arise.
The expert mode is somewhat more complex
but very flexible. A string of up to 5 word units
can be searched, where each unit may be a word
14http://www.catedratelefonica.upf.es/cucweb
22
form, lemma, part of speech, syntactic function or
combination of any of those. If a part of speech
is specified, further morphological information is
displayed, which can also be queried.
Each word unit can be marked as optional or
repeated, which corresponds to the Boolean op-
erators of repetition and optionality. Within each
word unit each information field may be negated,
allowing for exclusions in searches, e.g. requiring
a unit not to be a noun or not corresponding to a
certain lemma. This use of operators gives the ex-
pert mode an expressiveness close to regular gram-
mars, and exploits almost all querying functional-
ities of CQP ?the search engine.
In both modes, the user can retrieve up to 1000
examples, which can be viewed online or down-
loaded as a text file, and with different context
sizes. In addition, a link to a cache copy of the
document and to its original location is provided.
As for the statistics interface, it searches for
frequency information regarding the query of the
user. The frequency can be related to any of the
4 annotation levels (word, lemma, POS, function).
For example, it is possible to search for a given
verb lemma and get the frequencies of each verb
form, or to look for adjectives modifying the word
dona (?woman?) and obtain the list of lemmata
with their associated frequency. The results are
offered as a table with absolute and relative fre-
quency, and they can be viewed online or retrieved
as a CSV file. In addition, each of the results has
an associated link to the actual examples in the
corpus.
The interface is technically quite complex, and
the corpus quite large. There are still aspects to
be solved both in the implementation and the doc-
umentation of the interface. Even restricting the
searches to 1000 hits, efficiency remains often a
problem in the example search mode, and more
so in the statistics interface. Two partial solutions
have been adopted so far: first, to divide the cor-
pus into 4 subcorpora, as explained in Section 2.2,
so that parallel searches can be performed and thus
the search engine is not as often overloaded. Sec-
ond, to limit the amount of memory and time for a
given query. In the statistics interface, a status bar
shows the progress of the query in percentage and
the time left.
The interface does not offer the full range of
CWB/CQP functionalities, mainly because it was
not demanded by our ?known? users (most of them
linguists and translators from the Department of
Translation and Philology at Universitat Pompeu
Fabra). However it is planned to increasingly add
new features and functionalities. Up to now we did
not detect any incompatibility between splitting
the corpora and the implementation of CWB/CQP
deployment or querying functionalities.
3.2 Whole dataset
The annotated corpus can be used as a source of
data for NLP purposes. A previous version of the
CUCWeb corpus ?obtained with the methodology
described in this paper, but crawling only the .es
domain, consisting of 180 million words? has al-
ready been exploited in a lexical acquisition task,
aimed at classifying Catalan verbs into syntactic
classes (Mayol et al, 2006).
Cluster analysis was applied to a 200 verb set,
modeled in terms of 10 linguistically defined fea-
tures. The data for the clustering were first ex-
tracted from a fragment of CTILC (14 million
word). Using the manual tagging of the corpus, an
average 0.84 f-score was obtained. Using CatCG,
the performance decreased only 2 points (0.82 f-
score).
In a subsequent experiment, the data were ex-
tracted from the CUCWeb corpus. Given that it
is 12 times larger than the traditional corpus, the
question was whether ?more data is better data?
(Church and Mercer, 1993, 18-19). Banko and
Brill (2001) present a case study on confusion set
disambiguation that supports this slogan. Surpris-
ingly enough, results using CUCWeb were sig-
nificantly worse than those using the traditional
corpus, even with automatic linguistic processing:
CUCWeb lead to an average 0.71 f-score, so an 11
point difference resulted. These results somewhat
question the quality of the CUCWeb corpus, par-
ticularly so as the authors attribute the difference
to noise in the CUCWeb and difficulties in linguis-
tic processing (see Section 4). However, 0.71 is
still well beyond the 0.33 f-score baseline, so that
our analysis is that CUCWeb can be successfully
used in lexical acquisition tasks. Improvement in
both filtering and linguistic processing is still a
must, though.
4 Discussion of the architecture
The initial motivation for the CUCWeb project
was to obtain a large annotated corpus for Catalan.
However, we set up an architecture that enables
23
Figure 1: Architecture for building Web corpora
the construction of web corpora in general, pro-
vided the language-dependent modules are avail-
able. Figure 1 shows the current architecture for
CUCWeb.
The language-dependent modules are the lan-
guage classifier (our classifier now covers 10 lan-
guages, as explained in Section 2.2) and the lin-
guistic processing tools. In addition, the web inter-
face has to be adapted for each new tagset, piece
of information and linguistic level. For instance,
the interface currently does not support searches
for chunks or phrases.
Most of the problems we have encountered in
processing Web documents are not new (Baroni
and Ueyama, To appear), but they are much more
frequent in that kind of documents than in standard
running text.15 We now review the main problems
we came across:
Textual layout In general, they are problems
that arise due to the layout of Web documents,
which is very different to that of standard text. Pre-
processing tools have to be adapted to deal with
these elements. These include headers or footers
(Last modified...), copyright statements or frame
elements, the so-called boilerplates. Currently,
due to the fact that we process the text extracted by
the crawler, no boilerplate detection is performed,
which increases the amount of noise in the cor-
pus. Moreover, the pre-processing module does
not even handle e-mail addresses or phone num-
bers (they are not frequently found in the kind of
15By ?standard text?, we mean edited pieces of text, such
as newspapers, novels, encyclopedia, or technical manuals.
24
text it was designed to process); as a result, for
example, one of the most frequent determiners in
the corpus is 93, the phone prefix for Barcelona.
Another problem for the pre-processing module,
again due to the fact that we process the text ex-
tracted from the HTML markup, is that most of the
structural information is lost and many segmenta-
tion errors occur, errors that carry over to subse-
quent modules.
Spelling mistakes Most of the texts published
on the Web are only edited once, by their au-
thor, and are neither reviewed nor corrected, as is
usually the case in traditional textual collections
(Baeza-Yates et al, 2005). It could be argued
that this makes the language on the Web closer
to the ?actual language?, or at least representative
of other varieties in contrast to traditional corpora.
However, this feature makes Web documents diffi-
cult to process for NLP purposes, due to the large
quantity of spelling mistakes of all kinds. The
HTML support itself causes some of the difficul-
ties that are not exactly spelling mistakes: A par-
ticularly frequent kind of problem we have found
is that the first letter of a word gets segmented
from the rest of the word, mainly due to formatting
effects. Automatic spelling correction is a more
necessary module in the case of Web data.
Multilinguality Multilinguality is also not a
new issue (there are indeed multilingual books or
journals), but is one that becomes much more ev-
ident when handling Web documents. Our cur-
rent approach, given that we are not interested in
full coverage, but in quality, is to discard multi-
lingual documents (through the language classifier
and the linguistic filter). This causes two prob-
lems. On the one hand, potentially useful texts
are lost, if they are inserted in multilingual doc-
uments (note that the linguistic filter reduces the
initial collection to almost a half; see Table 1). On
the other hand, many multilingual documents re-
main in the corpus, because the amount of text
in another language does not reach the specified
threshold. Due to the sociological context of Cata-
lan, Spanish-Catalan documents are particularly
frequent, and this can cause trouble in e.g. lexical
acquisition tasks, because both are Romance lan-
guages and some word forms coincide. Currently,
both the language classifier and the dictionary fil-
ter are document-based, not sentence-based. A
better approach would be to do sentence-based
language classification. However, this would in-
crease the complexity of corpus construction and
management: If we want to maintain the notion
of document, pieces in other languages have to be
marked but not removed. Ideally, they should also
be tagged and subsequently made searchable.
Duplicates Finally, a problem which is indeed
particular to the Web is redundancy. Despite all
efforts in avoiding duplicates during the crawl-
ing and in detecting them in the collection (see
Section 2), there is still quite a lot of dupli-
cates or near-duplicates in the corpus. This is a
problem both for NLP purposes and for corpus
querying. More sophisticated algorithms, as in
Broder (2000), are needed to improve duplicate
detection.
5 Conclusions and future work
We have presented CUCWeb, a project aimed at
obtaining a large Catalan corpus from the Web and
making it available for all language users. As an
existing resource, it is possible to enhance it and
modify it, with e.g. better filters, better duplicate
detectors, or better NLP tools. Having an actual
corpus stored and annotated also makes it possible
to explore it, be it through the web interface or as
a dataset.
The first CUCWeb version (from data gathering
to linguistic processing and web interface imple-
mentation) was developed in only 6 months, with
partial dedication of a a team of 6 people. Since
then, many improvements have taken place, and
many more remain as a challenge, but it confirms
that creating a 166 million word annotated corpus,
given the current technological state of the art, is a
relatively easy and cheap issue.
Resources such as CUCWeb facilitate the tech-
nological development of non-major languages
and quantitative linguistic research, particularly so
if flexible web interfaces are implemented. In ad-
dition, they make it possible for NLP and Web
studies to converge, opening new fields of research
(e.g. sociolinguistic studies of the Web).
We have argued that the developed architecture
allows for the creation of Web corpora in general.
In fact, in the near future we plan to build a Span-
ish Web corpus and integrate it into the same web
interface, using the data already gathered. The
Spanish corpus, however, will be much larger than
the Catalan one (a conservative estimate is 600
25
million words), so that new challenges in process-
ing and searching it will arise.
We have also reviewed some of the challenges
that Web data pose to existing NLP tools, and ar-
gued that most are not new (textual layout, mis-
spellings, multilinguality), but more frequent on
the Web. To address some of them, we plan to de-
velop a more sophisticated pre-processing module
and a sentence-based language classifier and filter.
A more general challenge of Web corpora is the
control over its contents. Unlike traditional cor-
pora, where the origin of each text is clear and
deliberate, in CUCWeb the strategy is to gather
as much text as possible, provided it meets some
quality heuristics. The notion of balance is not
present anymore, although this needs not be a
drawback (Web corpora are at least representa-
tive of the language on the Web). However, what
is arguably a drawback is the black box effect
of the corpus, because the impact of text genre,
topic, and so on cannot be taken into account.
It would require a text classification procedure to
know what the collected corpus contains, and this
is again a meeting point for Web studies and NLP.
