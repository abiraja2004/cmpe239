Summary 
Model theoretic semantics (MTS) has 
a special attitude to describe seman- 
tics, to characterize both artif icial 
and natural languages by pure mathemat- 
ical tools and some of the basic prop- 
erties of this attitude are disscussed. 
The arsenal of MTS equipped here with 
such tools allowing the investigation 
at such a level of complexity that 
approximates the real situations. These 
tools are developed within the frame of 
category theory. 
i. The challan~e of formal 
ha ndlin@ of semantics 
For long times, natural language 
has been regarded as some very soft, 
amorphous, and whimsical  phenomenon. 
Although theoretical considerations 
showed that this may not be so, the very 
fact that actual l inguistic methodology 
was quite soft and intuitive seemed to 
confirm the conviction that language 
cannot be treated very rigorously. It 
is clear, however, that the more ex- 
plicit and transparent framework we use 
for handl ing a very complex phenomenon, 
the more can learn about what its com- 
plexity really consists of. It has been 
the use of more or less mathematical-  
-minded methods improving the situation 
in recent decades. 
A very important first step in the 
direction of establ ishing such a frame- 
work has been generative grammar. USing 
the theory of formal languages it gave 
a fairly abstract picture of what syntax 
{s, and it has also proved to be an 
extremely powerful tool in analysing 
admittedly very subtle syntactic phe- 
nomena and, what is even more, in dis- 
covering formerly unnoticed intercon- 
nections. 
Whatever revealing the results of 
generative grammar should be with res-  
pect to syntax, however, it cannot be 
regarded as paradigmatic if one is in- 
terested in a semantics-oriented model 
of language. Generative grammarians 
never put the question of what semantics 
is and what role it plays in language at the 
same theoretical level they reached 
with syntax. 
It is reasonable to require that 
any treatment of semantics be adequate 
to rigorously formalized methods used 
for syntax. For this we should use 
formalism not as abbreviation but as 
basic tool of investigation, e.g. re- 
lating exact mathematical  objects to 
components of language. Moreover we 
aim to characterize language through 
analysing the corresponding mathemati-  
cal methods. An appropriate approach 
can be borrowed from mathematical logic. 
This results the so called model theore~c 
semantics (MTS). MTS is an attitude to  
investigate natural language from the 
point of view of semantics. This atti- 
tude provides the investigation of 
natural language on an abstract level. 
Namely, it answers the question in the 
most abstract sense what language is 
and what its basic components are. The 
basic properties of the MTS's attitude 
are analysed in \[31. 
2. What is MTS? 
Language can be analysed only 
through analysing language carriers. 
From the different possible functions, 
the language possesses, we find the 
cognitive one the most signif icant and 
this answers our question above. Consid- 
ering a language carrying system 
/whether it be human or a machine or 
else/ the cognitive function is real- 
ized while the language is used to de- 
scribe objects and events of the envi- 
ronment under cognition. Characteris ing 
language we abstract from the cognitive 
process itself and from the internal 
213 
organ izat ion  of the system. Our mere 
concern is the outcome of the cogni t ive 
process, that is, descr ipt ive texts and 
their  re lat ion to the env i ronment  which 
they refer  to. MTS att i tude demands an 
ideal external  observer  (EO) who is to 
model the system (S) and the system's 
env i ronment  wor ld  (W). EO forms models 
of S, of W and of the S-W relat ion. 
In order that EO should be able to 
form the intended models,  he must pos- 
sess the fo l lowing kinds of knowledge 
about the sample s i tuat ion (and EO being 
an ideal observer,  we assume he real ly  
does): 
(i) EO knows the aspect and the 
level at which S may perceive 
and descr ibe the environment;  
in other words, EO knows S's 
sensit iv i ty.  
(ii) EO knows those fundamental  as- 
pects of W that S may 
describe. 
(i)-(i i) together  ensure that EO 
models W adequate ly  wi th  respect  to S. 
( i i i )EO knows that S is f inite 
whereas W is both inf in i te 
and inf in i te ly  complex. 
(iv) EO knows that S's actual  en- 
v i ronment  is accidental .  The 
knowledge S may obta in  at 
each stage of its cogni t ion is 
compat ib le  wi th  inf in i te ly  many 
poss ib le  worlds.  The S-W re- 
lat ion is therefore uncerta in:  
the texts of S always corre-  
spond to in f in i te ly  many envi-  
ronments,  rather than a unique 
one. 
On the bas is  of (i)-(iv) EO forms 
the fo l lowing models:  The model of S wi l l  
just be a system product ing  texts (more 
precisely,  the mater ia l  bodies of texts, 
whatever  they should be). In case EO 
happens to be a mathemat ic ian ,Mode l  (S) 
wi l l  be a formal grammar capable of gen- 
erat ing the texts of the language. 
The model of  W is a meta l ingu is t i c  
descr ipt ion  of the world, adequate to S' 
s sensit iv i ty.  For purely theoret ica l  
purposes,  EO only has to take into ac- 
count that S has some f ixed though 
arbi t rary sensit iv i ty,  determin ing the 
poss ib le  character  of the objects and 
phenomena of W S may descr ibe.  When 
model l ing  some concrete language, S's 
sens i t iv i ty  is also f ixed though no 
longer arb i t rary ly  . In case EO happens 
to be a mathemat ic ian,  Model  (W) wi l l  be 
a mathemat ica l  object. Because of the 
uncerta inty  of the S-W re lat ion,Model (W)  
is a class of models  of inf in i te ly  many 
poss ib le  worlds. 
The model of the S-W relation is some 
cor respondance between e lements of texts 
and things in the wor ld-models .  In case 
EO happens to be a mathemat ic ian,  
Model(S-W) can be a class of re lat ions 
or funct ions.  
We have reached the point where we 
may def ine language as it appears at 
this level of abstract ion.  By an abstraot 
language La we mean a triple <Model (S), 
Model  (W~, Model  (S-W)>. Furthermore,  
we cal l  Model  (S) the syntax of LA, 
and Model  (W) and Model  (S-W) together  
the semantics of L A. We emphasize that 
all these models are formed by an ideal 
external  observer  and are descr ibed in 
his own language.

In the case of c lass ica l  mathemat-  
ical logic f irst of all a s imi lar i ty  
type t is f ixed (t is a funct ion that 
renders a natura l  number, the arity, to 
each re lat ion and funct ion symbols of 
the basic  alphabet, i.e. of the signa- 
ture}. The set F t of all poss ib le  
formulas generated from the a lphabet  
with logical  connect ives in the usual  
way corresponds to Model(S) .  The class

3. MTS in more complex s i tuat ions 
A very simple, we may say, an ide- 
a l ized s i tuat ion has been cons idered 
above. Namely wi th  respect  to S it 
was supposed that its cogni t ion goes on 
at a f ixed level and aspect of analysis,  
i.e. with a f ixed sensit iv i ty.  We call 
this type of cogni t ion homogeneous 
cognit ion.  
214 
However  MTS att i tude enables us to 
character ize  natura l  language not only 
in the above s impl ic i ty  but in the 
complex i ty  that approx imates  more 
rea l i s t ic  cases. 
Indeed a system S can desr ibe 
the same objects and events of W from 
d i f ferent  aspects and at d i f ferent  lev- 
els cf detai l ing.  Moreover  beyond the 
great spect rum of sens i t iv i ty  d i f ferent  
env i ronment  wor lds can be the object  of 
cognit ion.  Cogni t ion  in this s i tuat ion 
is said to be heterogeneous cognit ion.  
The s i tuat ion  to be descr ibed f rom the 
point of v iew of EO is as fol lows.

i I 
The natura l  language i tse l f  vir-  
tual ly seems to enable us to speak about 
very d i f ferent  k inds of env i ronment  at 
very d i f ferent  levels from very d i f fer -  
ent aspects. 
Thus in this l ight natura l  lan- 
guage appears as an extremely  r ich many- 
-purpose language. 
Beyond the surface natural  lan- 
guage consits  of such parts which them- 
selves are languages as wel l  (cf. w i th  
the subdev is ion  of natura l  language 
into a set of d ia lects  or socio lects) .  
These parts, the sublanguages,  are 
h is tor ica l ly  formed from others. With 
the growth of the observable  env i ronment  
the cor respond ing  knowledge also widens. 
The latter needs new language e lements  
so as to be descr ibed.  Therefore some 
words change their  meanings,  new con- 
cepts appear which emerge into new 
sublanguages.  
E.g. the word "tree" has quite a 
d i f ferent  meaning for a woodman, for a 
b io logist ,  for a painter,  for a child, 
for a l inguist,  for a mathemat ic ian,  
etc. The d i f ferent  meanings are con~ 
nected with  d i f ferent  sub languages which  
are but  d i f ferent  soc io lects  in this 
case. 
However  the sublanguages are not 
independen t . They are in a very complex 
connect ion,  e.g. one may extract  lexical  
morpho log ica l  or other  k inds of connec-  
t ions on the base of wh ich  one or other 
h ierarchy of sublanguages can be sorted 
out. Such a h ierarchy provides a 
poss ib le  "select ion" for the natura l  
language. Thus a hierarchy of languages 
consists  of the const i tuent  languages 
together  wi th  the re lat ion cons idered 
between them. 
Note that one can f ind a deta i led  
survey of d i f ferent  approaches to sub- 
languages in \[6\], where another  ap- 
proach has ar isen to analyse sublan- 
guages which are ca l led there subsystems 
of languages. 
How natura l  language as a many 
purpose one can be invest igated wi th  
MTS att i tude. 
F i rst  of all a so ca l led disjunctive 
approach can be appl ied for, accord ing 
to which EO subdiv ides the language into 
such parts each of wh ich  can be model led  
as a homogeneous one, i.e. as a language 
that corresponds to a unique and f ixed 
sensi t iv i ty .  
Now it is supposed that S has 
several  languages rather  than a single 
one. So Model  (S} should consist  of a 
conglomerate  of sublanguages.  However 
if the sublanguages were independent  
then EO could model  S as a conglomerate  
of subsystems. But this is not the case 
because among most  of the sublanguages 
there are some t rans i t ion  poss ib i l i t ies  
e.g. t ranslat ion,  interpretat ion.  
The MTS att i tude possesses  tools 
(developed w i th in  the frame of mathe-  
mat ica l  logic) by the use of which the 
homogeneous cases can be descr ibed.  So 
a conglomerate  of languages can also be 
descr ibed by these tools but only as a 
conglomerate  of independent languages. 
What  about the connect ion between two 
languages? Mathemat ica l  logic prov ides  
tools only for the case when the lan- 
guages have the same s ignature,  i.e. 
when their  a lphabet  is the same. In 
this case the not ion of homomorph ism is 
power fu l  enough to descr ibe the connec- 
t ion between the languages. But such a 
case is of not much interest  to lin- 
guists. 
Perhaps it is more interest ing to 
analyse the connect ion  between languages 
of d i f ferent  type (e.g. between a tl- 
- type and t~-type f irst  order c lass ica l  
languagesl .  
Let us see e.g. t ranslat ion.  
Having two d i f ferent  languages say, 
Engl ish  and Russlan, t rans lat ing  a text 
from one into the other  f irst of all we 
require not a d i rect  cor respondence 
215 
between the words, but a connect ion 
between the cor respond ing  "world concep- 
t ions" of the languages and only then is 
it resonable  to estab l i sh  the connect ion  
between the syntact ica l  e lements.  In MTS 
this means that for the t rans la t ion  we 
have to 
i) represent  the "world concep- 
tion" of the languages in 
quest ion.  A "world concept ion"  
is but a set of sentences 
(knowledge) that determines  a 
subclass of Model(W);  
ii) es tab l i sh  the connect ion  be- 
tween the cor respond ing  sub- 
c lasses of models,  i.e. be- 
tween the "world concept ions" ;  
iii) es tab l i sh  the connect ion  among 
the cor respond ing  syntact ica l  
e lements.  
But up to now MTS has not been in pos- 
sess ion of tools to sat is fy  the above 
requ i rements  ( i)-( i i i ) .  
Note that in mathemat ica l  logic a 
set of sentences determines  a theory. A 
theory T determines  a subclass Mod (T) 
of models,  namely those models  where 
each sentence of T is val id. (Thus a 
theory T induces a new language 
<Ft,Mod(T)  , I = >.) Thus f i rst  of all a 
connect ion  between the cor respond ing  
theor ies is requ i red for the translat ion.  
However  t rans la t ion  between any two 
languages may not always exist. E.g. let 
us have two languages phys ics  and bio l -  
ogy and we want  to estab l i sh  connect ion  
between them. For this we should analyse 
the connect ion  between the cor respond ing  
knowledges .However  this analysis,  as 
usual, cannot  be es tab l i shed  direct ly.  
A med iator  theory is needed. The media-  
tor is an in terd i sc ip l inary  theory, e.g. 
the language of general  system theory 
(see e.g. \[2\]). By the use of the media-  
tor a new language with a new k ind of 
knowledge ar izes from the input lan- 
guages, namely b iophys ics .  
Our aim is the extens ion  of the MTS 
att i tude to analyse the semant ics  of 
many-purpose  languages and language 
h ierarchies .  We deve lop such tools (wlth- 
in the frame of mathemat ica l  logic) by 
the use  of which  EO can model  a language 
carry ing system not only in a homogene-  
ous s i tuat ion,  but in a heterogeneous  
one too, the complex i ty  of which  approx- 
imates the real cases. 
Here we only out l ine the basic  idea 
prov id ing  the basic  not ions,  s ince the 
bounds of this paper  do not a l low us to 
give a deta i led  descr ip t ion  of the tools 
This can be found in \[i\]. 
A l though the f irst order  c lass ica l  
languages do not seem to be adequate for 
l inguist ics ,  it st i l l  prov ides basis  for 
any MTS research.  Therefore  we introduce 
the necessary  tools of the analys is  of 
the h ierarch ies  of c lass ica l  f i rst order 
languages. These tools can be extended 
for the analys is  of d i f fe rent  kinds of 
languages mak ing  use of the exper ience 
prov ided  by the analys is  of the c lass i -  
cal case. 
4. Basic not ions 
Definition I. (similarity type) 
A s imi lar i ty  type t is a pair  t=<H,t '> 
such that "t' is a function, t' : Dom t '~N 
where N is the set of natura l  numbers 
and O~N, and H ~_ Dom (t'). 
Let <r,n>Et'  (i.e. let t'(r) = n). If 
r6H then r is said to be an n-1 -ary 
function symbol, if r~H then r is 
said to be an n-ary relation symbol .? 
Let ~ be an ordinal .  F~ denotes 
the set of al l  t - type formulas conta in-  
ing var iab le  symbols f rom a set of var i -  
ables of card ina l i ty  a. Thus a t - type 
f i rst  order language is <F?,M., t = > . If 
Ax  - F. and 9CF  then ~x I: ~ means . ~ . 
that 9 is a semant ica l  consequence of 
Ax. 
Definition 2. (theory) 
A pair  T = <Ax,F.~>, where Ax ~ Fa is 
- -  t said to be a theory in a var iables.  ? 
Note that a theory prov ides  a sub- 
language of L , namely  the tr ip le 
Mod 
Let T = <Ax,F~> be a theory, and 
~ ~ ~ ~ x Fa be~the semant ica l  equ i~ 
nc . t T tde f ined  as fol lows. For 
any formulas ~,% E F t : ~ ~T% iff 
Ax f= ~ ~-~ ~ . 
Definition 3. (concept) 
The~set  of the concepts of a theory T is 
Cm ~ F~ /~. (F~ / ~T  means the factor i -  
z~t ion-of  ?he ~et of formulas into such 
c lasses any two e lements  of which  are 
semant ica l ly  equ iva lent  w . r . t .T . )  ? 
Thus in the case of a given theory 
T C_ contains all the formulas which are 
compat ib le  wi th T. Moreover  C deter-  
mines what  can be descr ibed aT all about 
the models  by the use of theory T. Note 
that to CT a Boole a lgebra can be corre-  
sponded where O and 1 cor respond to 
"false" and "true" respect ive ly  and the 
operators  cor respond to the logical  con- 
nect ives.  Let us cons ider  the fo l lowing 
216 
Example 
Let t = <~,{<R, i>}> be the s imular i ty  
type and T = <0,F\[> be a theory. (Note 
that this theory is axiomless.)  We wr i te  
x instead of Xo, Rx instead of R(x) 
and ~ instead of 9 / ~ .  The concept  
a lgebra C T looks as fol Iows 
~ ~ x R x

where we use the fo l lowing notat ions:  
c=HxRxAHx~Rx , d=VxRxVVx~Rx , 
e=Rx-VxRx , f=~Rx~VxnRx , 
g=RxAHx~Rx , h=nRxA~xRx , 
i=9xRx~(RxAHx~Rx) ,  j=\ ]x~Rx-(~RxAgxRx) .  
The vertexes marker  by ~are  the fix- 
points of the operat ion  ~Xo. 
The formulas of the above C= tell  all 
T that can be said about the t - type mod- 
els in the c lass ica l  f i rst  order  lan- 
guage of a s ignature  of a s ingle unary 
re lat ion symbol  when the theory is 
atomless. ? 
Now we def ine how a theory can be 
interpreted by an other one. 
Definition 4. (interpretation) 
Let T = <Ax~,F~ > and T0=<Axa,F  k > 
be theor ies in ~ var iables.  Let = 
m:F. e ~F~ . 
The=\ [ r i~e  <T~,m,T~> is said to be an 
interpretation going f rom T~ into Ta 
(or an in terpretat ion  of T~ in T~) 
iff the fo l lowing condi t ions hold: 
a/ m(x .=x. )=(x .=x. )  for every i,j<a; 
b/ m(~) -~m(~)~m(~) ,  m(~)=~m(~) ,  
m( \ ]x .9)=gx.m(~)  for all 9,%~F~ ,i<a; 
c/ Axe~(~)  far all ~6F~ such t~t  
Ax~9.  
We shall  often say that m is an 
in terpretat ion  but in these cases we 
actual ly  mean <T~,m,T2>. ? 
Let m,n be two interpretat ions  of 
TI in Ta. 
The in terpretat ions  <TI ,m,T2>, 
<T1,n ,Ta> are def ined to be semantically 
equivalent, in symbols m~n, iff the 
fo l lowing condi t ion holds: 
I= \[m(~)*-~n(~)\] for all ~F~ Axa 
Let <TI ,m,T~> be an interpretat ion.  
We def ine the equ iva lence class m~ of m 
(or mo~e prec ise ly  <TI ,m,T2>/~) to be: 
m/~ = {<TI,n,T2> : nmm}. 
Now we are ready to def ine the connect ion 
between two theor ies TI and T2. 
Definition 5. (theory morphism) 
By a theory morphism u:T1-T2 going from T~ 
into T2 we understand an equiva lence 
class of in terpretat ions  of TI in Ta,i .e. 
is a theory morph ism ~:TI~T2 iff v= 
=m/~ for some in terpretat ion  <T I ,m,T2>.? 
The fo l lowing def in i t ion  provides a 
tool to represent  theory morphisms 
Definition 6. (presentation of theory 
morphisms ) 
a >be Let T =<AxI ,F9 > and Tp=<Axa,Fta  
two theor ies in ~la var iaSles.  
(i) By a presentation of in terpretat ions  
f rom TI to T2 we understand a 
mapping p : t ~-~F~ . 
(ii) The in terpretat ion  <TI ,m,T2> sat- 
isfies the presentat ion  p:t~ -~ F~2 ' 
iff for every <r,n>Et~ the fo l lowlng 
condi t ions hold: 
a/ If rEHI then m(r(xo ..... Xn_2) = 
=Xn-1 )=p(r,n); 
b/ If r?H1 then m(r(xo ..... xn_l))  = 
=p(r,n). 
We def ine the theory morphisms v to satis- 
fy the presentation p if <TI ,m,T2> satisf ies 
p for some <TI ,m,T2>6~. ? 
Proposition I. 
Let T I=<AxI ,F9 > and T2=<Axa,F9 > be 
, 1 t . .~  ~ ~2 two theorles.  ~et p:tl F~ be a pres -  
entat ion of in terpreta t io~ from TI to 
Ta. Then there is at most  one theory 
morph ism which  sat is f ies  p. ? 
Category  theory  provides the ade- 
quate mathemat ica l  frame wi th in  which  
theor ies and theory morphisms can be 
considered.  From now on we use the basic 
not ions of category theory in the usual  
sense (see e.g. \[4\] or \[5\]). 
F i rst  of all we show how the cate- 
gory interest ing for us looks like.

Let v:TI~T2 and w:Ta--Ts be two

The identity morphism Id~ on T is 
def ined to be IdT~( IdF~)/~ ? 
Proposition 2. 
TH a is a category with objects Ob/H a, 
morphisms MorTH a, compos i t ion  v0v for 
any v,96Mor lH a and ident i ty  morphisms 
Id T for all T~ObTH a. ? 
5. The main property  of TH a 
The heterogeneuous  s i tuat ion ,where  
the language carrying system uses not 
only one language to descr ibe the envi-  
ronment  wor ld  can be descr ibed by EO as 
the category TH ~. Note that TH ~ contains 
all poss ib le  h ierarchies ,  because the 
connect ion between any two const i tuents  
is but an e lement of MorTH a. The mathe-  
mat ica l  object  TH a provides the usage 
of the apparatus of category theory to 
analyse the propert ies  of language 
hierarchies.  Moreover  this frame al lows 
us to estab l i sh  connect ion between any 
two theories even if there is not any 
k ind of d i rect  re lat ion between them. 
In the latter case a "resultant" theory 
should be constructed which has d i rect  
connect ion with or ig ina l  ones and the 
power of express ion  of which joins that 
of the or ig ina l  ones. This "resultant" 
theory mediates  between the or ig ina l  
d i rect ly  unconnected theories. 
Note that the const ruct ion  of a 
resu l tant  theory to some given uncon- 
nected theor ies is one of .the most  impor- 
tant tasks of the General  System Theory 
(see e.g. \[2\]). 
The fo l lowing theorem claims the 
completeness of IH a (in the sense of

(in category theory) to the above ex- 
pected property.  
Theorem 3. 
(i) The category TH ~ of all theor ies 
is complete and cocomplete.  
(ii) There is an ef fect ive  procedure to 
construct  the l imits and col imits  
of the e f fect ive ly  g iven d iagrams 
in TH ~ . @ 
Now we enl ight  the not ions used in 
the above theorem. 
A diagram D in TH a is a d i rected 
graph whose arrows are label led by 
morphisms u:Ti~T j of Mor/H a and the 
nodes by the cor respond ing  objects 
(T i ,T jEObTH a ) .

are diagrams. 
Here the ident i ty  morphisms IdT

( i=O,i,2) are omit ted for clarity. We 
indicate the ident i ty  morphisms only if 
they are needed. ? 
Definition 8. ( cone, lim~ t, co limit ) 
A cone over a d iagram D is a family 
{a. :T-T.-T. is ob ject  of D} of morphisms 1 i" 1 . from a s ingle ob3ect  T such that T6ObTH ~, 
for any i e. CMorIH a and for any 
morphisms T . !~T.  of D a j=a io~ in TH a 
~ j iT .  \] 
(i.e. T ~ I  3 commutes).  
a i ~-~T i
The l~mit of a d iagram D in TH ~ is a 
cone {a. :T~T. :T. is object  of D\] over D 
such thalt fop anly other cone 
{Si:R~Ti:Ti  is object  of D\] over D there 
is a unlque morph ism v:R~T such that 
Bi=~oa i ? 
The colimit of D is def ined exect ly  as 
above but all the arrows are reversed. ? 
Definition 9. (complete, cocomplete) 
A category K is said to be complete and 
cocomplete if for every d iagram D in K 
both the l imit and the col imit  of D 
exist  in K. ? 
By aboves we see that Theorem 3 
says that every d iagram in IH a has both 
l imit and col imit  in TH a. I.e. in the 
category TH a of all theor ies all possi -  
ble l imits and col imits  exist  (and can 
be constructed) .  
Now let us see some 
Ex~amp l e s 
Let T-~<~,F~o>, T I~<AxI ,Ft I>,  where 
t =<#, .. ,\[<R,2>}> t~=<{+} , {<+,3>\]> and 
A~1-~{(Xo+Xo:Xo) , ( (Xo+Xl)+x2=xo+(x l+x2)) ,  
Xo+X1=X1+Xo} ? 
Let ~:To~TI and ~:To-TI be two theory 
morphisms such that for some mEv and 
n6~ we have 
m(R(xo,xl  )) = Xo+X1=Xl 
and 
n(R(xo,x l ) )  = Xo+X1=Xo . 
A. Cons ider  the  d iagram To...._ .

The col imit  of this d iagram is ~T

~T ~ 
where Ta="Lat t i ce  theory", i.e. 
T2=<Ax2,F~ >,where 
t2=< {+, "\] ,t~<+, 3>,<" , 3>} > and 
AX2={(Xo+(Xo 'X~)=Xo) , (Xo ' (Xo+Xl )=Xo)  }U 
u {(Xo'Xo=Xo), ( (Xo'X~)'x==xo" (x~'x2)), 
(Xo " X~=X~ "Xo )} UAX~ ? 
p and 6 are such that r (xo+x~=x2) = 
=Xo+X~ =x2 and d(xo+x~=x2)=Xo ' x~ =x2 
for some r@p and d~6 
B. Cons ider  the d iagram T~_~T~.  
The col imit  of this d iagram is 
T~ ~ ~T,  ~ ~ T2 
> and where T2=<Ax2, F t 
Ax ={Xo~X~=X~+Xo,  (Xo+X~)+x~=xo+(X~+X2) ,  
Xo+Xo=Xo , 
Xo+Xq=Xo -~ Xl=Xo 
Proof of A 
i./ Proof of pov = 6ow: 
r (m(R(xo ,x l ) ) )=r (xo+x1=xl )=Xo+Xl=Xl .  
d (n (R(xo ,x l ) ) )=d(xo+x1=xo)=Xo 'X1=Xo.  
We have to prove rom=don, i.e. we have 
to show (Xo+X1=Xl ) /~Ta=(Xo 'X1=Xo) /~T2,  
i.e. that Ax2 ~ (Xo+X1=X1*-~Xo'X1=Xo). 
Suppose Xo+X~=Xl.  Then xo'x~=; 
=Xo' (Xo+Xl)=Xo,  by (Xo' (Xo+Xl)=Xo)6Ax2.  
We obtain Ax2 1 = (Xo 'X~=Xo-Xo+X~=X~) 
similar ly.  
2./ Suppose 0'or = 6'o~. We have to 
show ~op = p~ and ~o6 = 6' for some 
theory morph ism ~. 
Let r'~p' and d'E6'. 
Ax~ ?- ( r ' (xo+x1=xl ) -~d ' (xo+x1=xo) )  by 
p ' 0v=6 ' ow. d 
Let p(xo+x1=x2)  ~ r ' (xo+x1=x~) and 
p(xo 'x1=x2)  - d ' (xo+x1=x2)  
We have to show that p determines a 
theory morph ism ~:T2-T2 '. I.e. we have 
to show that (V~EAx2) Ax2' \]= p(~). 
Notat ion:  r'(+) ~-S, d'(?) = ? , 
We know that Ax' l={Xo@Xo=Xo,(Xo@Xl)@x2 = 
=Xo@(X~SX2) ,XoeX1=X~Xo?X1=Xo} ? 
Now p(xoe(Xo 'X~)=Xo)  = Xo@(Xo~X~)=Xo.  
We have to show Ax2' I = Xo@(Xo@Xl)=Xo.  
xo@(Xo@Xl ) = (XoGXo)Sxl =Xo@Xl and 
therefore Xo?(Xo@Xl)=Xo.  S imi lar ly  
for the other e lements of Ax2. ? 
Proof of B: 
The proof is based on the fact that 
Th(Ax21=Th(Ax1@{Xo+X1=Xo*-~Xo+Xl=Xl}).  @ 
Many further in terest ing  features 
of TH a could be detected had we no 
l imits of our paper. 
6. Instead of conc lus ion 
In aboves MTS att i tude has been 
equ ipped wi th  new tools which might  
a l low the invest igat ion  of both natura l  
and ar t i f i c ia l  languages at such a 
level of complex i ty  that approx imates  
the real  s i tuat ions.  We bel ieve that 
these open up new perspect ives  for MTS 
in the invest igat ion  of both computa-  
t ional  and theoret ica l  l inguist ics.  
E.g. MTS may prov ide a descr ip t ion  
in each case where the connect ion 
between two or more sub languages p lay 
a s ign i f icant  role. We think that this 
is the case in the semant ica l  invest i -  
gat ion of certa in types of humor as 
well ,  where humor might  appear by un- 
usual  in terpretat ions  of texts. This 
can be descr ibed by es tab l i sh ing  the 
connect ion between the cor respond ing  
theor ies that represent  knowledge,  i.e. 
presupos i t ions .  The fo l lowing jokes 
ref lect  the afore ment ioned type: 
l."Why didn't you come to the last 
meeting?" 
"Had I known it was the last I would 
have come." 
2.Two men were d iscuss ing  a third. 
"He thinks he is a wit" said one of 
them. 
"Yes", rep l ied the other, "but he is 
only half right"
