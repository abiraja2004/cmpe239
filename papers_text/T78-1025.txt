SEMANTIC PRIMITIVES IN LANGUAGE AND VISION 
Yorick Wilks 
Department of Language and L ingu is t i cs  
Un ivers i ty  of Essex 
Colchester,  England. 
The purpose of th i s  b r ie f  note is to argue 
that ,  whatever the jus t i f i ca t ion  of semantic 
p r imi t lves  for  language understanding may be \[see 
Wilks 1977\] there is no reason to bel ieve that i t  
re lates to v i s ion  in any strong sense. 
By "semantic p r imi t ives"  I mean the general 
sort  of  item proposed w i th in  Ar t i f i c ia l  In te l l i -  
gence (AI) by Wllks (1972, 1977), Schank (1973) 
and w i th in  l ingu is t i cs  by Fodor and Katz (1963), 
Jackendoff (1975) among many others ,  in both cases. 
The genera l i ty  of these items is essent ia l  to my 
argument, and I shal l  not count as semantic 
p r imi t ives  items used for  special tasks, whether 
or not those tasks are related to v i s ion ,  as are 
the v isual  descr ip t ion  pr imi t ives  of Johnson- 
Laird (1977). 
Spat ia l  versus v isua l  
What fo l lows is h igh ly  naive and specu- 
la t ive :  i t  w i l l  rest la rge ly  upon the opposit ion 
of  l ingu is t i c  knowledge to spat ia l  and v isual  
knowledge respect ive ly .  I take i t  for  granted 
that  the la t te r  are not necessar i ly  connected, 
and so to es tab l i sh  that  ~e need spat ia l  know- 
ledge to understand language (to name a task at 
random) does not es tab l i sh  that we need v isual  
knowledge. The lack of necessary connexion is 
shown by such hackneyed examples as the person 
b l ind  from b i r th ,  who has no v i sua l ,  but a great 
deal of spat ia l ,  knowledge. 
One in i t ia l  reason for  d i s t ingu ish ing  the two 
is the great deal of  argumentation in l ingu is t i cs  
in recent years that  fa l l s  under the general 
heading Iocal ism. This th rust  of argumentation 
has sought to es tab l i sh  the central  ro le of spat ia l  
concepts in l ingu is t i cs ,  and among i t s  best known 
proponents are Anderson (1971), F i l lmore (1977) 
and Jackendoff (1975). One stand in th i s  view is 
to argue that  temporal express iomare in general 
reducable, in some sense, to spat ia l  ones: that  
in ten minutes (a time expression) is dependent 
on the spat ia l  sense of such forms as in f i ve  
miles.  This is a very d i f f i cu l t  and general 
debate: there is contrary evidence from cu l tures  
where space is indicated by time (The a i rpor t  is 
i.S about ten mlnutes a~az), and there is a strong 
ph i losophica l  t rad i t ion ,  centred round Kant, that  
our sense of  time is log ica l ly  p r io r  to our sense 
of space. That Is to say, we could conceive of  
s t ruc tur ing  our experience wi thout  the concept of 
space, but not w i thout  that of time because, i f  we 
could not know that  one event preceded another, 
then we could probably not know anything at a l l ;  
not even mathematics i f  that  consists at bottom in 
sequences of operat ions.  Michotte 's  famous 
experiments on the w i l l ingness  of subjects to 
attach the word cause to moving p ictures  of pai rs  
of "s t r i k ing  b i l l i a rd  ba l l s "  is sometimes c i ted  
as prov id ing a v isua l  basis for  causa l i ty  (Clarke 
& Clark 1977), although the not ion of causa l i ty  
may wel l  in fact  make no sense wi thout  the 
concept of time. We could assert (wrongly, as i t  
happens) that  l ighten ing  causes thunder wi thout  
the aid of  a spat ia l  concept, but not w i thout  a 
temporal one. 
The log ica l  or l ingu is t i c  p r iq r i ty  of space 
to time is by no means a set t led  matter,  and 
ne i ther  therefore is the thesis  of local ism. I 
have argued that  the role of the v isua l  in 
language is not necessar i ly  supported by the need 
for  spat ia l  knowledge, and so the status of  the 
la t te r  need not be discussed. Nonetheless, I 
have questioned the se l f -ev ident ia l  t ru th  of  
180 
Iocal ism, jus t  in case anyone should think that ,  
i f  i t  were t rue,  i t  would support the cent ra l i ty  of  
v isual  knowledge in language understanding. 
Let us now, as the br ie f  substance of  th is  
paper, look at three arguments that might be put 
forward to support the dependence, or in ter -  
dependence, of l i ngu is t i c  and visual knowledge. 
Evolut ionary ar~umants 
This comes in phylogenetic and ontogenetlc 
forms. The former is the ingenious argument 
(Gregory 1970) that ,  since the human race has been 
able to see for  many times more mi l len ia  than i t  
has been able to speak or wr i te ,  then i t  might 
seem reasonable to be l ieve,  on evo lut ionary  
grounds that the brain "took over" the ex is t ing  
visual  structures for  language understanding and 
production. This argument may well  be true,  but 
at present there is no independent evidence that 
would count for  or against i t .  
The "ontogenetic form" of the argument - in 
the ind iv idua l ,  that is - is that one f i r s t  learns 
words essent ia l l y  through the visual channel, and 
so again our l ingu is t i c  knowledge is essent ia l l y  
dependent upon visual c r i te r ia  and experience. 
The best quick answer is to turn to the sort  of  
word often used as a semantic p r imi t ive  in AI 
language understanding systems: STUFF (=substance), 
ATRANS (=changing the ownership of an ent i ty ) ,  
CAUSE (=preceding and necess i tat ing an event).  
I t  is h ighly dubious that such very general 
concepts are, or can be, taught by v i sua l /  
ostensive methods. Can one point  at substance as 
such? One may want, or mean, to, but can one in 
fact re l iab ly  do so? 
One structure for  many purposes 
This is a widespread view in AI that has been 
argued for exp l i c i t l y  by Hinsky (1975) and Rieger 
(1976), among others. Roughly speaking, i t  is 
that implemented systems should use a s ingle 
knowledge structure for  a range of purposes: 
language understanding, problem solv ing,  etc.  
I t  is an addi t iona l  assumption that human beings 
do funct ion in th is  way. 
The thesis can be expressed at many leve ls ,  
and at a su f f i c ient ly  general level i t  is almost 
cer ta in ly  true. But i t  might then mean no more 
than that a s ingle programming language could 
express general sub-routlnes for  parsing, noise 
reduction etc. for  a number of  input channels. 
At a more spec i f i c  level was the thesis ,  not now 
widely supported, that language and v is ion  in some 
sense shared the same "grammar", in the sense of  
Chomsky's transformational  grammar (Clowes 1972). 
S t r ik ing  evidence from the para l le l i sm between 
visual and l ingu is t i c  ambiguity was found, and the 
fact that Chomsky's grammars no longer seem such 
p laus ib le  candidates for  such a ro le does not mean 
that the thesis i t se l f  is fa lse at that leve l .  
Let us concentrate for  a moment on two more 
spec i f i c  leve ls .  F i r s t ,  consider the well-known 
contrast between such sentences as: 
The paper moved 
The dog moved 
Linguists who d i f fe r  about much else would 
want to ascribe a notion of agency to the subject 
of  the second sentence but not the f i r s t .  Hany 
in AI working on natural language would agree, and 
add that the notion of agency is essent ia l  i f  other 
important inferences are to be made. But, surely 
no one would argue that agency is ,  in any useful 
sense ascribed a visual  c r i te r ia ,  that could be 
reduced to the visual d i f ferences of  paper and 
dogs. I t  is in fact a complex theoret ica l  notion 
dependent upon our be l ie fs  and theories about the 
world: we do not now at t r ibute  agency to trees,  
though some fe l low humans do. But th is  d i f ference 
is a theoret ica l  ( inc luding l ingu is t i c )  one, not 
one of  d i f ference of visual perception. 
Secondly, we may return to general semantic 
p r imi t ives  of  the sort already mentioned (and 
s imi la r  inventor ies may be found in (Bierwisch 
1970) and (Leech 1974)). 
There are many possible ways in which one 
might seek to jus t i fy  such pr imi t ives  (see Wilks 
1977), and Bierwisch (1970) has gone on record 
as saying that they do denote, and are to that 
extent dependent upon v i sua l ly  observable 
ent i t ies .  I suggested above that that may not be 
so: one may point  at t reac le ,  water or elephant 
meats but i t  is not so c lear  one can point  at 
SUBSTANCE, yet th is  notion has a role to play in 
language understanding for  how, without i t ,  can 
one economically express such axioms as "A 
quant i ty  of  a substance plus a quant l t~of  i t  
181 
y ie ld  a quant i ty  3 of i t " .  This axiom is not true 
of  physical objects,  as d i s t inc t  from substances. 
A well-known confusion must be avoided here: 
i t  may well  be true,  as the model theoret ic  
semanticists l i ke  Montague claim, that any 
contentfu l  not ion,  p r imi t ive  or not,  refers to a 
funct ion of  sets. In that sense move might be 
said to refer  to a set of  ent i t ies  that move. 
However, th is  point  about logica l  reference 
has no consequences for  the point  about whether 
or not such pr imi t ives  denote ent i t ies  in the 
real world. 
Visual and spat ia l  imagery 
F ina l ly ,  i t  is sometimes argued that the 
structures underlying language must depend upon 
those underlying v is ion  i f  only because natural  
language is so fu l l  o f  v isual  imagery. In 
whatever sense "v isua l  imagery" is taken, th is  
fact  is ,  I be l ieve,  i r re levant  to any precise 
assert ion under discussion, by which I mean any of  
I )  Language understanding processes in humans 
depend, e i ther  as to p r imi t ive  elements or 
s t ructure,  on visual  experience and the 
mechanisms that in terpret  i t .  
I I )  The spec i f i ca t ion  of  language in humans has 
no s ign i f i cant  over lap,  in terms of  p r imi t ive  
elements or s t ructure,  with that of other 
facu l t ies ,  l i ke  v i s ion .  
I I I )  Visual processes in humans depend, e i ther  as 
to elements or s t ructure,  on l ingu is t i c  
experience and the mechanisms that in terpret  
and produce (sic) i t .  
For a l l  three theses only anecdotal evidence 
is ava i lab le ,  though I would be strengthened by 
empir ical  evidence that the b l ind from b i r th  were 
less able to understand the use o f~sua l  imagery 
in language. Those with a prede l l c t ion  for  motor 
theories should be tempted to consider the Whorfian 
thesis I I I  (Whorl, remember, bel ieved we might 
perceive, say l ightn ing ,  as an ent i ty ,  rather than 
an ac t iv i ty  or process because we denoted i t  by 
a member of the theoret ica l  category NOUN, rather 
than VERB) since, as the st ructura l  d i f ference of  
I and I I I  makes c lear ,  language is an ac t iv i ty  in 
a way v is ion  is not. 
Thesis I I  w i l l  be agreeable to those who are 
impressed by the way in which confusion can ar ise 
when one t r ies  to br ing together information on 
the same top ic ,  but obtained v ia d i f fe rent  
channels. As when one refers to two c i t ies  whose 
mutual re la t ion  of  pos i t ion  one knows from a map; 
between which one can dr ive "without  th ink ing" ;  
and also about both of  which one has a great deal 
of  textua l / fac tua l  information.  Readers of  
(Fillmore 1977) wi l l  feca l |  his attempt to 
describe the re la t ion  of  a text-based frame and 
an exper ient ia l l y -based  scene to the same 
, ,  
s i tuat ion .  I th ink AI workers at th is  par t i cu la r  
inter face could pro f i t  from considering the 
extent to which such possible inconsistencies 
can be matters of  theory rather than super f i c ia l  
fact :  an observer who is asked whether two sides 
of  a long ra i lway l ine  meet at the fur thest  point  
he can see w i l l  give an answer not independent 
of  of  his abstract (possibly l ingu is t i ca l l y  based) 
theory of  para l le l  l ines.  
In conclusion, th is  note has t r ied  to do no 
more than ward o f f  certa in  confusions, and to 
stress how many points of  view are s t i l l  open, 
stnce the evidence for  and against them is no 
more than anecdotal,  even when the anecdotes come 
from Psychology labs. The choice between theses 
1/11/111 is a metaphysical one, in the more red- 
blooded sense of  that over t i red  word: i t  cannot 
be made on empir ical  grounds now, but i t  can have 
important pract ica l  consequences about where one 
chooses to look for  answers.
