Abstract  
Degree words in natural lauguage, such as 'often' ~md 
%ometinies,' do not ha.ve (ieln)t,~tions in the reid world. 
This causes some interesting clmracteristics tor degree 
words. For exami)h; ~the correspondence between the. 
English word 'often' :rod the intuitively corresponding 
aa>nese word is not ebvhms. This paper proposes 
a conceptual representat;ion to describe a wide range 
of linguistic phenomelul, which are rehtted to degree 
concepts in natural language. 
1 Int roduct ion  
Degree words in natural l;mguage, which are exempll- 
lied by the tbllowing, exist across p~rts of speech and 
across specific languages.

Degree words haw,. S()llle interesting characteristics. 
First, quantities in the real workl which can be repre 
sented by degree words w~.ry pragmatically, depending 
on speakers, situa.tions, etc. (Fauconnier, 1.975). This 
means that degree words do not have denotations in
the rea,1 world. IIowever, lllalty degreL' expressions are 
used in daily life and it; is not tblt thai, they are par- 
ticula.rly incomprehensil~le. The authors do not think 
thaC to underst~md the lneanhtgs of degree words is to 
understan(\[ tit(; rea.l quantities in the real world. 
Second~ it is difficult to compare: degree words in dif- 
ferent languages, in the case of the English non-degree 
word ~dog, ~ we may think that the word semantically 
corresponds to the ;lapanese word 'iml' because these 
two words reli!r to ~he same object 'clog' in the real 
world. However, this correspondence is not true of de- 
gree words. Tim English woM %ften' intuitively cor- 
responds to Lit('. Japanese word %hitmshib% ~but this 
correspondence is not ol)vious. 'Fhat is because these 
words do not have. denota.tions in the real world. 
These chttra.cteristics a, re related to the b~vse of Ma- 
chine Tr~tnslation and its dietionaries. Even when the 
real quantity, which is reti?rred to by ~t degree word in 
~t ext, is not clearly understood, it is usually believed 
that it is possible to translate the word into ~tnother 
language. When building bi-lingual dictiomtries, it is 
necessary to consider the correspondence b tween (lm 
gree words in each htnguage. A new reference frame- 
work is needed by which to investigate to what extent 
the two words correspond to each other. These issues 
are. also related to conceptual descriptions in btrge scale 
knowledge l)aae projects, wlfieh have started recently. 
Third, degree words tuwe some ch~racteristics which 
are indepelMent from in~rts of speech. One of the phe- 
nomena degree words have in comnlon is modification 
restrictions between degree words and rlegree intensi.- 
tiers. Each degree word ha.s its own modification re- 
striction (Bolinger, 1972; Quirk, 1985; Kamei, 1988, 
1990). For example, %IP and qm ~ can be modified 
by 'Minos(,' but 'tall,' 'short,' hnany~' and 'few' can- 
not usually be so h~mdled. On the other hand, %all,' 
%hort,' many,' and 'ihw' rail be modified by ~ve.ry,' but 
'all' a,nd %0' cannot. 'Some' trod 'sometimes' cannot 
be modified by either %ery' or ~ahnost.' 
Previous researchers pointed out a lot of important 
linguistic phenonmna~ which ~re related to degree words 
but, the issues described abow ~. were left uninw~stigated. 
Barwise trod Cooper (1981) investigate relations I)c~ 
taween determiners in English and ge,mrMized quantl- 
tiers in logic. Howew.'r, they did not focus so much on 
degree words, such ~s ~tdjeetiw'.s and adverbs in gen- 
eral. it is still undetermined how to fully comprehend 
such words as 'ma.ny' and % i'ew.' Oazdar (1979) and 
IIirsehberg (1985) introduced ideas of a linear ordering 
of degree words and treated ~ wide range of phenom- 
elut related to degree words. However, they directly 
htmrlled real words and treated ~positive words ~ such 
as %11' and hnany,' ~nd qmgative words ~ such as flew' 
and %o ~ separ~ttely. Relations between the positive and 
negative words were not clear. In order to con,prehend 
these, unsolwM linguistic phenomena~ the authors pro- 
pose a semantic model of degree, concepts.

2 D isc re te  Degree  Pr imi t ives  
and a List Express ion  
This section introduces discrete degree priinitives and 
a list expression 'co represent mea.nings of degree con- 
cepts. From the perspective of quantities in the real 
world, hnany' and 'some' are sfmilar. However, The 
modification restriction be.tween degree words and de- 
gree intensifier shows that e~mh word is normally mod- 
ified by intensifiers electively. This suggests the exis- 
tence of DISCILETE degree concept primitives, which 
are independent from parts of speech. The authors 
introduce five basic semantic primitives (~A,' ~M,' ~S ,' 
'F,'  and 'N') indicating degree that are abstracted from 
the meanings of %.11,' hnany,' some,' ~fcw,' and ;no.' A 
list of degree primitives is used to describe meanings 
of degree words in terms of relative positions in the list 
expression. 
{A, M, S, l>, N} 
The list expression above is a basic list of the discrete 
model. The ,utthors divide meanings of degree words 
inte two parl;s. For example, 'tall' and %hort' can be 
divided into the semantic axis regarding 'tallness' and 
the degree concepts 'many (much)' ~md 'few (little).' 
Tables 2 and 3 represent the htter  part of meanings of 
degree words. In these lists, ' - '  means that the value 
in that pa.rtict,la.r position is lacking. 
Table 1: List Examples (1) 
Basic list {A, M, S, F, N} 
~dl, always {A, - ,  - ,  - ,  --}

Ttd)le 2: List Examples (2) 
Basic list {M, S, F} 
tall {M, --, -}  
not tall and not short {- ,  S, -}  
short {- ,  - ,  F} 
The authors think that degree words are identified 
by their relative positions in the list expression. It is 
true that quantities in the real world, which are ex- 
pressed by degree words, are continuous, tIow('.ver, the 
authors think that language treats degree concepts in 
a discrete way. T~d)le 3 shows modificatiou restrictions 
on degree intensifiers using the primitives. In this ta- 
ble, % '  shows that the intensifiers can lnodify the (le- 
gree primitives, and ' - '  shows the intensifiers cannot 
modify the prinfitives. Note that these primitives are 
not real words and that they consistently describe re- 
lationships that are independent from parts of speech. 
These are important differences between this model 
and previous research reports.

3 A Dua l  List Express ion  of  De-  
gree Concept 
It is pointed out that degree words convey non-literal 
'conversational' meanings when they are used. The dig 
ference between a literati meaning and a converst~tional 
meaning is called 'CouversationM Imf)licature' (Grice, 
1967). This section explains how this model treats this 
aspect of degree concepts. 
3.1  Quest ion  and  Answer  
(17o exemplify Conversational Implicature, let us con- 
sider the following sentence, which includes a number. 
(3) I solved three of the problems. 
A natural interpretation of this sentence i s "I solved 
just three of the prol)lems, not all or four or two or 
one or none of them." Kowever, in a logical way, this 
statement is true, when "I solved FOUR of them." For 
example, if the border line between success and failure 
of a test is three, this sentence is naturally spoken, even 
when, in fact, the person solved four of the i)roblems 
(Chomsky, 1972; Ota, 1980; Ikeuehi, 1985). The fol- 
lowing is a Yes/No question corresponding to sentence 
(3) and its answers. Interestingly, both of the answers 
below are possible in this case. 
(4) A: Did you solve three of the problems ? 
B: - Yes, in fact i solved four. 
- No, I solved four. 
In order to handle these phenomena, more complex 
states than just 'three' for the meaning of the nu,nber 
thre.e are needed. The authors think that five states 
are a.ctually needed fbr clarity: (1) All problems are 
solved. (2) The mmlber of solwxl problems exceeds 
the number which aI)pears in the sentence (=three in 
this case). (3) The number of solved problems is ex- 
actly the number which appears. (4) The number of 
776 
solved problems does not total tilt: mnnber which ap- 
pears. (5) No l)roblenls are solved. The authors intro- 
duce the five primitives, 'A,' '>n\ ]  ~: 1 h' ' In , '  and 'N,' 
corresponding t/) these five states, respec.tively. A list 
expression is introduced as follow.'<

In an atIirmativc sen~,enci:, t.he upper ~direct' lrleilAl-

rogative sentence, the h)w(:r 'pos.~ibh? meaning plays a 
more imp/)r taa:t role. This model explains the two pos- 
~dl)h' a n,~wers in ntwranee (d) in a. simph' way, In Fig.

of 'fonr' in this ci~se) is express(!d with a single list (in

3.2  Negat ion  Operat ions  
This section introduces Neg~tion Operations, which 
axe. deti.ed on the dual list representation. Sentence 
(7) is a negative smite,we which correslmnds to sen- 
tence (3). A negative sentence like this tuus several in- 
terpretations which previous research as pointed out 
but has not been able to treat satisNctorily. This 
model calculates all the possible interpretations of a 
negative sentence fi'om the representation f the origi- 
na.l Mlirmative sentenc.e. 
(7) 1 didn't solve three of tile problems. 
One possible interpretation of sentence (7) is that 
there ~rc three problems that "i (lid uot solve" (Inter- 
pretation A). In tllis interprets.lion, the n/tmber %hree ~ 
is not under the influence of the negation; the number 
in out of the scope of negation. '1'o obtain this interpre- 
tation, it is not necessary to change the dtml list for 
the originM affirmative sentence (6). It is necessary 
to change the meaning of the values from the num- 
ber of tim solved problems to the number of unsolved 
problen:s in the representation of the original Mfirma- 
tiw~ sentence (Fig. 2). The lower row expresses the 
possibility that the number of the unsolved problems 
exceeds  t hl.et:.

Where the musher (=three in this case) is within 
the scope of negation, the negative sentence requires 
other interpretations.

B: No, i didn't (get to) solve three of

.--- Interpretation (B) 
1Lesponse B might mean that some of the 1)roblems 
were solved, but that the munber did :tot reach three. 
This interpretation can be obtained from tile model 
shown in Fig. 3, and the negation operation is shown 
in Table 5.

2. Select the COMMON part of the two rows. 
The result is a new possible interpretation row. 
3. Omit t, he edge values (A aud N). 
The resnlt is a. new direct ineauing row. 
Tabh~ 5: Negation Operation tbr Interpretation B 
Step 1 in Table 5 rea.lizes a primitive negation oper- 
s, tion on each row. This i,~terpretation f the negative 
sentence is consistent with the negations of both the 
direct meaning and the possible implic~tion. Step 2 
realizes this condition. This interpretation usually im- 
plies that there are some solved problems. This means 
the negation usually does not deny the. existence of tile 
solw~d prol)lems, ttowever, in a logical way, no prob- 
lem being solved is a possible situation. Step 3 realizes 
this condition. 
(9) A: l)id you solve three of tke problems? 
C: No, I didn't solve THREE of 
the probh;ms: I solved ALL of them. 
- Interpretation (C) 
The above is a possible utterance, which requires 
~nother interpretation. Table 6 shows the way to cal- 
culate this interpretation (I:~terl)retation (C)). 
1. Reverse ach affirmative row, 
2. Select the DIFFERENT part of the two rows. 
The result is a new possible interpretatiou row. 
3. Omit the edge wdues (A and N). 
The result is a new direct meaning row. 
Table 6: Negation Operation for Interpretation C 
This interpretation differs from interpretation B, 
only at Step 2, that is, 'to select the DIFFERENT 
p~rt of the two rows.' This means that the interpreta- 
tion is consistent with only the negation of tile direct 
meaning, and does not satisfy the negation of the pos- 
sibh." implication. Step 2 realizes this condition. This 
exemplifies that the Conversational Implicature can be 
canceled. In speech~ stress is put on THREE and ALL 
in this interpret,~tion, and this linguistic phenomenon 
is accounted for in Step 2. 
4 Negat ion  of Degree  Expres-  
sions in Natura l  Language 
In this section~ the dual list representation a d the op- 
erations introduced in the previous ection are applied 
to degree words other than numbers. 
4.1 'All,' ~no,' ~some,' and ~not all' 
Here, we will apply the same model to the relations 
between 'all/~some~' 'no,' and blot all' in natural an- 
guage. Sentence (10-1) logically entails sentence (10- 
2). Sentence (10-2) usually implies senteuce (10-3). 
Itowever, sentence (10-3) contradicts the original sell- 
fence (10~1). A careless mixture of logical implication 
and usmd implication in language makes the inference 
of (10-3) from (10-1) unreasonable (t-Iorn, 1972; Ota, 
1980; McCawley 1981). 
(10-1) All students are intelligeut. 
(10-2) Some students are intelligent. 
(10-3) Some students are NOT intelligent. 
The discrete model is ~ usethl tool for describing 
these relations. List (11) is used to express relations 
1)etween 'all,' 'some,' 'no,' ~tnd 'not all (= some ... 
not).' In this case, only three primitives are used. 
(H) {a, s, N} 
In this list, the w~lue ~S' corresponds to the state 
wherein there are SOME students who are intelligent 
and SOME other students who are NOT intelligent. 
The me,~nings of these words are also expressed with a 
dual list. Figure 7 graphically represents this.

same time. Itowever, these two CAN BE FALSE art 
tile s~mm time, beca.use it is 1)ossible that some stu- 
dents a.re intelligent auld seine students are not. The

nothing in this (:ase. (Fig. 5). The negation oper~tions

Note th~tt 'S' in list (11) in this section mentions only 
the existence of intelligent st.ud~mts and non-intolllg('nt 
students. In Section 2, the same symbol 'S' was used 
for the rnea.ning of 'seine' which is relatively defined 
ill the {A, M, S, F, N } (list (2)). \]h, tha.t ease, the 
value ~S' r(;presents a quantlt~ttlve aspect of {SOllle.' A 
relation betwc'eu ~S' in list (11) and %S+ ' = ~S' in list 
(2) is described as iollows: 
S- ( M, S +, F ) 
YIowever, the authors used the same vadue ~S' in 
both list:;, 1)ecaa:se the difl'erence~ between these two 
~S's is represented by the set of values in list expres.- 
sions. These two 'S's correspond to ambiguities which 
the. word 'some' in natural la:Dguage has.

This paper introduced eight basic degree primitives 
for degree concept, that is, 'A,' 'M,' 'S,' 'F,' 'N,' '>n,' 
'=n,'  and '<n.'  ttowever, the authors do not claim 
that these eight primitives are sufficient o indicate 
all degree concepts. Instead~ the authors clMm that 
people comprehend degree concepts in a discrete way, 
and that degree concepts are identified by their rela- 
tlw~ positions in the fl'amework of understanding. Con- 
sider the following cxan~ples concerning ,~nother degree 
concept 'several,' which differs from these eight degree 
concepts. 
(13) They legally have several wives. 
Quantities, which are refl.'rred to by 'sew'.ral' and 'a 
few,' seem to be close. It is often said that quantities 
ret>rred to by 'several' include fiw.' or six, and more 
tha.n the quantities referred to by '~t few.' However, 
sentence (13) shows th~tt 'several' means more than 
one in this case. Previous researchers have not been 
successflfl in describing the diflhrence between 'sevend' 
and 'a few.' The authors think that 'sew.'ral' should 
be in a list including 'several' and 'one,' while 'a few' 
should be in a list which contains 'a few' ~tnd 'many.' 
'Several' implies 'not one,' while '~ few' implies 'not 
many.' An important point is that the ditference be- 
tween 'several' and ~a few' is not the exact quantity 
involved, but a framework of understanding, that is, 
the set of vahms in the lists and their relative posi- 
tions. 
4.3 'OR'  in Natura l  Language and 
Negat ion  
It has been shown that the logical operator ~OR' 
has characteristics similar to degree concepts (Gazdar, 
1979). This is because 'o f  in natural anguage gener- 
ally has two interpretations, the 'inclusive or' and the 
'exclusiw'. or.' This section applies the same model for 
degree concepts to a logical operator 'OIL' and 'or' in 
natural anguage. 
It is difficult to conceptualize the ne.gation of 'or' in 
natural anguage, in a usual sense, although negation 
of 'and' is easy. Logically, however, the negation of the 
logical operation 'OR' (that is, 'Inclusive or') is 'NOR.' 
However, in a sense in natured language, 'AND' instead 
of 'NOR' can also be a negation of 'Oil..' 
and or nor

Fig. 9: Negations of 'OP,' 
Figure 9 shows the relationship between tile inclusive 
and exclusive 'or' and their negations. The authors use 
three states: (,-+), (+- / -+) ,  and ( - - ) .  'Exclusive 
or' is a direct meaniug of 'or' ~tnd 'inclusive or' is a 
possible interpret~tion f 'or' in this framework. The 
same negation operations will produce the two neg>

th)ns of 'or 1' tha.t is, both NOR and AND. Tim direct 
mea, ning rows in the two interl)ret;~tlons of nega.tions of 
'or' ha.ve no values. This corresponds to the Met tha.t 
it. is difficult to consider the nega.tion of %r' in mttura,l 
language. No~(; that the dual list fbr 'or' and the du;d 
list. for 'somo' in Fig. 4 ha.ve an ido.ntical structure. It 
is equally explained that the nega.tion of 'some' is difli- 
cttlt to consider in na.tural language., while the neg~tion 
of %11' is easy. 
5 Conclusion 
This pa.per has present(!d ~ new model for degree con- 
cepts in na.l, ur;d langtutge. The characteristics for the 
model are: (1) The discrete degree primitives. (2) Tim 
list represent~tion f degree concepts. (;3) q'iu', duaJ list, 
representa.tion \[br possibilities of Conw~rs~tiona.1 hnpli- 
ca.tuft. (4) The intersection operation on the list for 
realizing t;nt;a.ihnent of two concepts. (5) The nega?iol| 
ol)era.tions on the dua.1 list to <dculaw~ a,ll the possil)le 
interl)reta.\[ions of nega.tion of degree concepts.

gests theft the model represents substantial structures 
in mttural la.ngu~tge and is ~t suitalJle tool for naturM 
l~nguage understanding. The authors holm that this 
model will be one of the possible extensions of the first- 
order Logic.
