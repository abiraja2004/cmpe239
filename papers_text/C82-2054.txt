The present paper discusses the principles of designing 
a system for man-computer di~lo6ue in natural, language. The 
system is being elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical 
Linguistics at the Institute of Mathematics with Computer 
Center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 
The desorlbed system requires: 
I. A form~ description of the syntax of basic nuclear 
structures of the natural lanEuage sentences which has to be 
used during the process of syntactical analysis of the users" 
phrases in a natural language~ 
2. Techniques for representing in the computer the 
knowledge about a given problem area. The obtained descript- 
ion has to be used during the process of semantical analysis 
of the users" phrases in a natural language! 
3. A dictionary containing the terms used in the chosan 
problem area. The dictionary is compiled by specialists in 
the given problem area; 
4e A dictionary containing the eel-vice vocabulary (in- 
dependent of a particular problem area) - word-groups as 
"less than", "geater  than", "equal to", "slid", "or", "as... 
ash etc. 
5. A basic software system - a data base management 
- 222  - 
system (for example, a relational DBMS), or a program package 
(for example, BMDP - bio-medical data processing). These 
ready software products service users of- a given problem area 
and they usually have their own language for describing and 
process ing  the data .  
The cons idered  system i s  viewed as a supers t ruc ture  
over  the  g iven  so f tware  system and i t  performs:  
1. T rans la t ion  from a language c lose  to the natur~al one 
in to  the in terna l  so f tware  sys tem's  language fo r  descr ip t ion  
or  p rocess ing  the data ;  
2. An e f fo r t  to ana lyse  the cor rec tness  of  the user ' s  
request  in  terms of the  g iven problem area  descr ip t ion  and 
messages when d iscover ing  mis takes!  
3. When ambigu i t ies  happen a d ia logue  i s  car r ied  out in  
o rder  to  make the user ' s  request  unambiguous. 
4. ~rocess ing  the resu l t s  from the bas ic  so f tware  sys -  
tem and f ina l  shaping of  the messages in  the context  of  the 
user ' s  request .  
Such a system is called a linguistic processor (or 
l inguistic preprocessor) and is considered as a dynamic sys- 
tem which can be generated over various problem areas and 
various basic software systems. 
By "a natural fan .age  as a tool for the man - computer 
dialogue" in this paper we mean the following: 
- a fixed list of appropriate natural language phrases 
is not aseigned~ 
- restrictions are not imposed on the ~rammatical 
structures of the sentences the man enters into the computer! 
- man has to interact with the computer in a correct 
natural language.

The descr ibe  approach fo r  c reat in~ l ingu is t i c  p rocessors  
can be qua l i f i ed  as a semant ic  - syntact i ca l  one s ince  semant-  
i ca l  ana lys i s  in  terms of  the g iven  problem area  descr ip t ion  
has a lead ing  ro le  in  the process  of  "unders tand ing"  of  the 
input  phrase in  a natura l  language,  whi le syntact i ca l  ana lys i s  
has an aux i l i a ry  ro le .  The s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ion  of  the prob~ 
lem area  i s  a network des igned fo r  the representat ion  of the 
problem area  semant ics  and i s  viewed as a s ta t i c ,  inmobl le  
and determinat ive  too l  fo r  "unders tand ing"  and accompl ish ing 
the d ia logue .  The syntact i ca l  ana lys i s  does not presume a fu l l  
scanning of  the input  sentence .  I t  invo lves  ana lys i s  of  synt -  
ac t i ca l  dependences at  d i f fe rent  leve ls  wi th  respect  to the 
problem area  complex i ty  and, natura l ly ,  to  the input  phrase 
complex i ty .  By means of  an e laborat ion  of  the  formal descr ip t -  
i on  of  Bu lgar ian  syntax ,  an improvement of  the techn iques  fo r  
syntact i ca l  ana lys i s  i s  env isaged .  
When work i r~ out the pr inc ip les  of  const ruc t ion  of  
l ingu is t i c  p rocessors ,  some pecu l ia r i t ies  of  the Bu lgar ian  
lan~age have been taken in to  account ,  namely, i t s  f lex iona~ 
character ,  the absence of  a case system, f ree  word-order ,  e tc .  
The approach proposed fo r  the  rea l i za t ion  of  the man - 
computer dialogue in a natural language allows to process 
problem areas with different complexity. Linguistics process- 
ors at two levels are bein~ elaborated at the Laboratory of 
Mathematical Linguistics - for access of users - nonprogr~mn- 
ere to a relational data base in Bulgarian l~ags  and for 
access of users - nonprogrammere to the facil ities for stat- 
Istloal analysis proposed by the program package \ ]~DI  )
