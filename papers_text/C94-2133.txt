Abstract 
This paper describes the first reported gram- 
matical framework for a nmltimodal inter- 
face. Although multimodal interfaces offer the 
promise of a flexible and user fl'iendly means 
of human-coml)uter interaction, no study has 
yet appeared on formal granunatical f'l'ame- 
works for theln. We have developed Multi- 
Modal Definite Clause Ch'ammar (MM-I)CG), 
an extension of Definite Clause Gramumr. The 
major features of MM-I)CG inch, de eal)ability 
to handle an arbitrary mlmber of modes and 
temporal information in grammar ules, l:ur- 
ther, we have developed MM-DCG translator 
to transfer ules in MM-DCG into Prolog pred- 
icates. 
1 In t roduct ion  
This paper describes tile first reported grammatical 
fi'amework for a multimodal interface. Specifically, the 
authors have developed MM-DC.G (Multi-Modal l)cfi- 
nite Clause Gra,nmar), an extension of I)CCI \[Pereira 
and Warren, 1980\] for lnultm3odal input processing. 
The major features of MM-DCG include capability to 
handle an arbitrary nn,nber of modes and temporal in- 
formation in grammar ules. 
The motivation behind this research was two-foht. 
First, the extension to multimodal was found t.o be 
the minimum requirement \[br natural language inter- 
face systems to be insta.lled in real al~plications. We 
have developed natural language interface for relational 
database (RDB) \[Shimazu et. al., I9!)2; Arita et. al., 
1992a; Arita et. al., 1992b\]. Spoken user queries are 
transformed into SQL specifications, and dispatched t.o 
RDBMS. The retrieved results are displayed at a com- 
puter terminal. The results include not only table forms 
but also picture images, like Figure 1. When users see 
picture images on the terminal, they naturally want to 
generate following queries by referring to such picture 
images. For example, they want to say, "Show me the 
interior of this one" or "Are there the same type of cars 
as this ear" while pointing at a specific picture on the 
display. If such multi-modal utterances be accept.able, 
the natural language interface will be more practical 
Figure I: Natural Language Interface Screen hnage 
enough to be used in many real world applications. 
Second, no st;udy has yet appeard on developing for- 
real grammatical fi'amework for multi-modal interfaces. 
Although there have been many researches on multi- 
modal systems, these systems are built as task-specific 
expert systems. The capability of such systems to pro- 
cess multi-moda.l inputs is too limited to interpret com- 
plex multi-modal expressions. This is mainly due to the 
fact that they have not developed their systems on for- 
nml grammatical framework for multi-modal interfaces. 
MM-DCG is the first reported grammatical frame- 
work for a multimodal interface. Multi-modal input 
processing rules can be written in MM-I)CG simply and 
effectively. Rules in MM-I)CG are translated into Pro- 
log predicates easily. 
2 Mul t i -Moda l  Input  P rocess ing  
Consider a query (.'xample to a nmlti-modal interface 
with a screen image like Figure. 1. A user states "Can 
this, attach this," pointing at a picture on the screen 
and clicking the mouse during the first "this" and then 
choosing an item fl'om a lllenu during the second. The 
system must realize that the first point is to a spe- 
cific autonaobile and the second is to the menu item 
"CD player". After integrating the two mouse pointing 
events into the two "this" in the utterance, the system 
nmst create an internal representation f this query that 
conforms to SQI, specifications. \[n tiffs example, even 
if the order of the two mouse clicking events is opposite, 
832 
the system Intlst generate the salne SQI, spcciiicaI.ion, 
but the interl>retation will I>e i\]l(>l'e dill|cult. In order 
to interpret such complex (:ombinatio,s of lmllti-modal 
inputs, the following requirement.s exist: 
(1) Modes  should be inter I ) reted equal ly  an<t in- 
del)ende.ntly. In <:onventiomtl multi-modal systems, 
natural language mode plays a major role, aml other 
modes such as mouse input mode are auxilia.ry. Inl)uts 
of auxiliary modes are merged into <;orresl)onding at- 
ural language expressions iu a surl'ace level, and the 
merged natural language query is interpreted I>y con- 
ventionatl natural language parsers. Therefore, varie.l.y 
of accepte<l multi-modatl exl>r<'.ssions is very limited. 
llowever, If each tnode is treated wit, Is the same man- 
sler as that  of ssatsls'atl \]allgSH/ge IlSOde, SyllldtX assd s(,- 
mantics of iulmts of each mode are (lefim~d with gram- 
sBar forlnulat;ion. 'Fhus, ccmq)lex exl)rcsskms can l>e de 
fined declaratively and more easily 
(2) Mode int<~'rI)reta|;ion should be r<4'(!l'red to 
one another ,  lnl)uts or each mode should be inter- 
preted independently. Ilowever, the interl)retatiol~ of
such inputs should be referred I>y other lnode interl)re- 
tattions. There are alnbiguities which arc solved only by 
integrating partial interl)retabi<ms oF related modes. For 
examl>le, if user states "tiffs car", l>oi~ttit~g at an object 
which is overlal>l)ed on the. car object., the alnhiguity of 
the object pointing must he solved by conHlaring (lie 
two mode interpretations. 
(3) Mode interpre, tai;icm should handle  temI>oral 
in thrmat ion .  Tetlq>oral iuformation of inputs, such 
as input arriving time, inl,erwd between two inl)uts, 
plays an important role to i,~terl)rct mull.i-modal inputs. 
Consider an exasnl>le that a user states "\]low muc\[s is 
this car", and points at, a car i>icture a litt.le after the 
utterance. If tile interwd is three .scco~sds, the l>ointing 
event should be integrated with "this car" in the ut-. 
terance. Ilowever, if the ilH.erwd is three illi~sles, tile 
event should not I)e int.egraled.

3.2 Cal<:ulating the Ins tant ia ted  T ime of 
Grammat ica l  Categorh,,s 
Inputs of a single mode invariably have ordering rela- 
tions among them. A parser like DCG uses such order 
relations to amdyze syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 
h,pul.s of differe.nt modes, however, have no inherent or- 
dering rehd.ions. Therefore, MM-I)CG requires tim at- 
t.achmelH: of both the beginning time and the end time 
to each individual piece or input data. MM-DCG au- 
tomatically calculates the beginning time and the end 
tiuw of any lew4 of grammatical categories generated 
during Imrsing. 
MM-I)C(; translator automatically generates the 
code which calculates the beginsfing and end times of 
any body goal in at grammar ule. The translator gen- 
erates two extra argnments to store the beginning time 
and end time into each head and body goals in MM- 
I)CG rules. The beg|truing time argument of the head 
is unified with the beg|truing time argulner, t of the first 
hody goal. The end time a.rgu,nent of the head is uniIied 
with the end time argument of the last body goal. Fig- 
m'e 3 shows the argtH\]lellt organization of noun_phrase 
rule. 
Thus, for example, if a noun phra~se category is in- 
stantiatcd by pa.rsing "tile blue car", the beginning time 
of the instant|areal category becomes equal to tile begin- 
,ring tilsle of "the", and the end time of the category is 
equal to the end time of "car".

Figure 4: Thneout C.oncept 
MM-DCG requires any input frolu every mode to 
have begimfing and end times. Thus, each item in an 
input sequence will haw; the following sl.ructilre: 
input(beginning-time, end-time, <actual input>) 
which means that the actual input was inputted frolll 
start-tlme and completed at. end-time. Adding of this 
time information is easy for ally of the SOl'l.s of till)ill. 
modes we are considering (i.e. speecll recognition, key- 
board inputs, mouse 1)oint, ing, el.c). 
One other iml)orta.nt item of notation: \[l'a variable 
is explicitly bound within at goal, the variable ret.urus 
the beginning and end times of the goal hi the R)rlll of 
a finletor. Thus, 
Time^goal 
means that "if goal succeeds, the beginnhlg time and 
end time of tile goal are rctnl'ned ill the wu'iable Time." 
Using the time iiflbrmation of instautiated categories, 
rule writers can define chronological collstra.ints aniong 
categories, for exaniple, the following descriptiotl ex- 
presses a constraint hat pronoun category and pointing

Timeout is a constraint of intervals belween an input 
and its succeeding input of n. streanl (See Figure 4). If 
an interval between inputs of a st rean| hecomes larger 
than a threshold defined in gralluiu/r rllles, tile tinieout 
occurs, and tile streani is regarded C.llipl.y l.einporariiy 
although there still exist inputs in it..

4 Rules Wr i t ten in MM~DCG 
4.1 Syntax  
MM-DCG syntax extends I)CG in the following ways: 
? A body goal may o,' may not be specified its con- 
smiting stream: 
Irl' a body goal consumes inputs from specific 
streams, the goal must be accompanied by the 
stream names. For example, tile following rule 
noun_phrase --> keyboard:pronoun. 
nieans that "if the pronoun category is found which 
is generated by inputs from the keyboard stream, 
noun_phrase is found." If a body goal is not accom- 
pa,iied by any stream name, the goal is regarded as 
consunling sonic amount of inputs fi'om all modes. 
For example, the following rule 
noun_phrase --> noun. 
lneans that "if the noun category is found which 
is generated by inpufos frorn certain streams, 
noun_phrase is found." 
? A terminal synibol should always be accompanied 
by a specific stream name: 
For example, the following rule 
pointing--> mouse:\[button(left, loc(X, Y)\]. 
means that "if a flmctor button(left, Ice(X, Y)) is 
found at the mouse strea.nl, pointing is found". 
4.2 l ime Example  
To demonstrate how MM-I)CG rules are written, this 
section describes a simple grammar needed to handle 
"object" with multi-modal inputs. 
Figure 5 shows the definition of "object". A rule 
writer defines existing slmeams pecifically using a unit 
clause, active_stream/1. "Object" are specilied by using 
eitller one of the abow~' inodes or their combinations. 
The first object/ l  delhfition interprets natural lan- 
guage specifh:ations such as "the blue car". The second 
object/ l  interprets a nlouse clicking which points at a. 
sl>ecific grai>hical object on the display. The third ob- 
ject/ l  definition izd.erprets a combination of a natural 
language utterance and a inouse pointing, such as stat- 
ing "the bhle car" while pointing at a graphical object 
oil the display. A natural language utterance is inter- 
preted at. the noun_phrase body goal, and the identified 
object is bound to Objl. A mouse pointing event is in- 
terpreted at the pointing body goal, and the identified 
object is bound to Obj2. 
Then, Objl and Obj2 are compared their values in a 
Prolog predicate enclosed inside curly brackets { and 
}. Both variables honld be equal. If not, because the 
interpretation of noun_phrase or point ing must be wrong, 
bacld.racking occurs. 
As seen above, a single grammar rule in MM-I)CG 
can allow the coexistence of grammatical categories in 
different niodes, thus allowing for their integration. In 
addition, teniporal and context sensitive information 
can be interchanged aniong categories of different modes 
in a single rule.

6 Related work 
The idea of understandillg multi-modal inputs in con- 
junction with each other, as presented in this paper, is 
not particularly new. The idea of a nnllti-n/odal input 
combining motions and pointing has been explored in a 
number of contexts. The classic 1980 paper "I>ut-That- 
There" \[Bolt, 1980\] describes an early system that pro- 
cedurally combined voice and gesture inputs. This idea 
was further explored in terms of integrating natural an- 
guage and pointing by \[/Iayes, 1988\], who related nmlti- 
modal inputs to anaphoric reference in imtural language 
processing, particularly to t.he work o\[' \[Grosz, 1977\] and 
\[Sidner, 1979\]. Recent work in the design of direct ma- 
nipulation interfaces has also explored the notion of in- 
tegrating a set of diverse inpuls. Othe.r palmrs explor- 
ing multimodal interfaces include \[Allgayer el. al., 1989; 
Cohen el. a l . ,  1989; Cohen, 1991; Kobsa et. al., 1986; 
Wahlster, 1989\]. Most of this work, howew.'r, has tb- 
cused on the application of the ideas, and not on the 
principles for integrating the different inputs. 1 
7 Conclusion 
In this paper, we haw; proposed the use of a grammar 
for dealing with input ewmt.s in a lmdti-modal user in- 
terface. We proposed MM-I)C(~, a novel gralnmatical 
framework for amult imodal  inl.erface. MM-I)(:G is an 
extension of 1)CG for rnull.i-modal inpuls processing. 
The major features of MM-D(:G inchldc capability to 
handle an arbitrary nnnaber of modes and feral)oral in- 
formation in grammar rules. We showed its use \['or a 
simple example. The translation technique of the MM- 
DCG rules into Prolog predicates was also presented. 
An initiM implementation of MM-I)CG has been devel- 
oped at NEC Corporation, alld is currently being used 
for the development of a l)rototype mull.i-modal inter- 
face.
