The mudLeX; lin~ulstlo features 
Russ ian and Eng l i sh  have aa~ important  cater - lee  in  ooamen. 
For  ins tance ,  both  have sub jec ts ,  verbs ,  ob jec ts ,  nominal groups,  
OOmmIt:L'ImLoni3. clauses and so one When it comes to finer details, 
though, the dlfferenoes between the two languages become more 
not ieeab le  than the s imi la r i t ies :  the use of aux i l ia ry  verbs 
I;O represent tenses, for instance, is quite different (e.g~ did 
not  ask = we c npocx~)  
The bas ic  task  o f  th i s  model i s  to  prov ide a means of  
represent ing  in  the computer a~ Russ ian  graemat iee l  s t ruc ture  
wh:Loh th.e analysis algorithm a&y have to express. As far as 
possible this representation must be independent of the particular 
conventions of either language. For ezaaple we cnpocx~ would 
not be ascribed an~ internal structure, but would be represented 
as "cHl~oc-/ask, negative, past tense". The ana3~is woul8 
dlsoover these facts, conoe~t.z~ itself only with Russian conven- 
tions~ and the synthesis woula express thee in En s ~ p  o o n ~  
itse\]~ only with the English conventions. "Negative" and u~ 
tense" are examples of choices within closed sets of possibilities. 
Such sets  a re  known as systems.  Our model there fore  has two main 
l insu is t i c  features ,  s t ruc ture  and system, which w~ both be 
needed to describe a Russian sentence. This tez~alnolo~ is taken 
f~oe the work of Halliday (1961). 
~he s t ructure  i s  fundamenta l~ a h ie rarchy  of const i tuents ,  
but  there  are  four  ways in  whieh i t  d i f fe rs  from a convent iona l  
constituent structure: 
(1) Each constituent may e~eeplif~ choices in systems, and, as 
illustrated above, this means that some units in the tez~ 
(e.g. particles and auxiliaries) are not given places in 
the s t ructure .  
(2) One item may occupy more than one place in the structure. 
The on~ nee~ for this in scientiflo Russian seems to be 
-1 -  
the ~ role of a relative wet4 in linking a subordinate 
clause to some +higher eonatituent and at the same tlne 
some role within its structure. 
(3) There is no requirement fo~ a eonstituent to be eontinuous 
in.the text (although "~hose found by the eurrent analysis 
al&urltha always are) ,  
(~) I f  the systems are powerful enough there i s  no need for  
exp l io i t  ordering of suboonstituents.  This point wi l l  
be taken up again la ter .  
The no,el: eoaputln~ features 
A grammatical structure of word-groups is represented in 
the computer by a list structure, that is to say a collection 
of stored items called elements with the property that eaeh 
element e i ther  ( i )  contains addresses of one or more other 
elements, or (ii) is ma~ked as a terminal element? The 
elements represent single items (words or idAome); the other 
elements each represent a larger word-group or eonctituent of the 
sentence= If an element A contains the address of an element B, 
this represents the fact that woz~l-group A inoludes word-group B. 
For example, the d~soriptlon of the structure of the group 
wewSoAee ~pocTas AoKewwa~ CTp_~Typa includes four terLinal 
elements (for the four words) and two other elements, linked as 
follows: 
=aw6oJee . . .  e . . . . ~  ~ 
. . . . . . . . .  ' / I  
121"21"2::2 . . . .  . . . . . . .  I 
(AG = ad ject iva l  group, 
NG = nominal group) 
Eaoh element is labelled with a code giving the constituent 
type (noun, verbal  ~oup,eto . ) ,  and eaeh address re fer r in  8 to 
an inoluded wor&-~oup is  1abe-lied with a code giving the ro le  . 
of the smaller group in the larger  one (complement in prepo-~iona l  
-2 -  
With ro les  includedp the above descr ip t ion  becomes: 
wax6oJee. _~da 
_,oo.,, ...... - ' / T  
::'2:'2:--"_. I 
Role s: 
I = .ed.~ier (in .~) 
. = ~ad ( in  ~G) 
\]E~A = pre-acl~eetive ( in  AG) 
A~ = aa~active ( in  AC~) 
Choices in Systems are also represented in a label in the 
element concerned. This label is called the s~steas word~ 
In the above ezample, the systems word in the nominal group 
element records the numberp gender, and case of the group. 
In theory ,  the observed order of items i s  e i ther  evidence 
fo r  a par t i cu la r  s t ructure  (as in  the order of prepos i t ions  and 
thei~ complements), or evidence for  a choice in  a system (as in  
the order of aux i l i a ry  and subject  in  English in ter ro~t ive  
sentences) .  Jus t  the same i s  true of punctuat ion (some oo~as  
ind icate  s t ructure ,  e .g .  those marking clause boundaries; others 
i r~tnate  a oholo~ in a system, e.g. those d is t~sh ing  
0descr ip t ive '  and ' res t r i c t ive '  qua l i f ie rs  in  nominal groups)?. 
Y~eall~ then the model would have no need to represent  item order 
o r  punctuat ion exp l i c i t l y :  i t  would record the s t ructures  aria 
systems 9 and the synthesis algorithm would have a free hand in  
detera in ing the English order and punctuation a~oording to Engl ish 
s t ructu~ and eystemAc rules. But in practice the language 
features  concerned are not yet  understood in  su f f i c ient  deta i l ,  
so the synthes is  keeps the or ig ina l  order and punctuation except 
.... where i t  has some reason to change them. This means that  they 
need to be recorded in  the model statement. The addresses in  an 
element are therefore stored in  the same order as the const i tuents  
to which they re fer ,  aDd. each element inc ludes deta i l s  of a~ 
pu~tuat ion  s ~  the constituent.

Although most of the te rmino lo~ in the table will be se l f -

the 'members' may be oonstituents of an~ type, Likewise the 
pre f ix  group is  a general one D the *stock'  bein~ nounp ad jec t ive ,  
or verb.  ( In  p ract i se ,  for  reasons of pro~-amming convenience, 
the pre f ix  group was not used, such 6roups bein~ represents& by 
the ' s tock '  a lone,  raged  with the reference number of the pre f ix ) .

I t  should not  be ~er red  that  our ana lys i s  p rocesses  could 
reoognlse all these features; ~eed the clauses and. the eom- 
Imamtlve group were not usea at a l l .  
Assoc ia ted  with each type of const i tuent  there  are  certain 
systems. For example# a clause may beeither non-finite (ec Jw 
w unyzzc nozaT~ ... ) or finite. If finite, choices of mood 
(interro~tive/imperotive/~eclarativ'e), oox~itionali~, ax~ 
personality will have been made; and if the clause is personal 
there  w i l l  be selections of  person and mmber. All these 
systemic, cho ices  would be recorde~ in  the element ropresent ing  
the clause. 
Below, an example is given of the st~otural description 
of a complete sentence; ags~tu it is not a structure which the 
curron~ ~na~Tsis could produce,  but  is in tendad simP~7 to

The En~ish e~nthesis algorithm 
The synthes is  a lgor i thm has the task  of  tak ing  a sente~e 
expressed in  terms of the model descr ibed above, an~ producing 
from it the string of characters which form the English output 
sentenoe. 
The program uses the model statement to &uide it in 
decisions on: 
(1) re-ordering; 
(2) insertion of English 'function' words (auxiliary 
verbs, etc.); 
(3) selection of English equivalents from the short 
list in each dictionary entry; 
(4) inflection of English equivalents. 
These decisions are of course based on grammatical data only 
(both structural an~ systemic); in particular in the selection 
of equivalents no semantic or eolloeational techniques are used. 
The particular tasks under these head in~ which are 
appropriate to a particular type of constituent will in general 
need to be car r ie~ out whatever the ro le  of the const i tuent  in  
some h igher  s t ruc ture  may be; a~ we are therefore  led  to the 
need fo r  a separate rout ine  fo r  each const i tuent  ype.  Such a 
rout ine  w i l l  be ca l led  a const i tuent  ype procedure (CTP). 
The nominal group CTP, fo r  example, w i l l  be ca l led  upon when 
and only  when a nominal group has to be produced by the program. 
Since const i tuents  nest  w i th in  one another  f ree ly ,  one CTP 
w i l l  need to ca l l  on others  to deal  with the par ts  of the 
constituent in turn. The CTPs must in fact be written as fully 
recursive subroutines; and the program consists basically of a 
oontrol routine for exploring the list structure together with 
a set of CTPs, one for each constituent type. 
As was pointed out by Yngve (1960), it is a lin&uistic fact 
(a t  leas t  in  the Indo-European fami ly  of lansuages to which 
Russ ian and Eng l i sh  Both belong) that  in  ma~ const i tuents  the 
f ina l  sub-const i tuent  i s a group of words, whi le other sub- 
const i tuents  are more f requent ly  s ing le  i tems.  Thus ,multiple 
"nest iu~ of the CTPs usua l ly  invo lves  f ina l  suboonst i tuents .  
But in  these cases a l l  deta i l s  of  the higher const i tuent  can be 
" forgotten"  by ~e computer s ince that  const i tuent  w i l l  not need 
to be re turned  to ;  so even a long sentence nsede no great depth 
of  push-down store  to han~e the nested CTPs. (Lan~mge has 
presumably evolved in  th i s  way because of  an analogous advantage 
-6 -  
i n  the 
The first task of a CTP is to decide on any re-ordering 
needed. It implements such a decision simply by r e ~ g  
the addresses in the element concerned. Each CTP entered does 
thls, so that the individual items are met in their new order 
and can be added to the output string at once. 
The se lec t ion  and in f lec t ion  of equ iva lents  are  car r ied  
out a t  the time they  are  to be produced,  when a l l  re levant  
in fo rmat ion  i s  ava i lab le  to the CTP without  excurs ions  in to  
o ther  par ts  of the s t ructure .  The inser t ion  of funct ion  words,  
on the o ther  hand,  say be done by a~y CTP. 
The resu l t ing  Eng l i sh  output s t r ing  i s  then passed to  a 
f ina l  program which i s  respons ib le  fo r  format cont ro l .  The 
normal form of  output  i s  punched paper  tape ,  from which the 
pr in ted  copy,  as  shown in  McDaniel e t  a l ,  ( th i s  conference) ,  i s  
produced on a ' F lex~wr i te r ' .  There i s  an a l te rnat ive  form o f  
output  on punched cards ,  from which pr in ted  copy can be produced 
on a card -cont ro l led  typewr i te r .  This ear l ie r  form g ives  the 
text  in  the two languages s ide  by s ide ,  which was use fu l  fo r  
research  purposes ,  but  the absence of  lower -case  Roman le t te rs  
and pa~Lnat ion,  add the res t r i c ted  width o f  each language 
version, makes this form less well suited for general use. 
This format cont ro l  p rocess ,  and the main cont ro l  rout ine  
which dea ls  with the exp lorat ion  of  the t ree  and the handover 
from one CTP to the next ,  need not be descr ibed  fu r ther ,  but

verbal groups, for instance inserting does not for ~he 
present tense 3r~ person singular ne~tive. The precise 
rules for the position of the insertion are complex, but 
roughly these words are inserted immediately before the verb 
in negative verbal groups and before the verb and a~ 
immediately preceding adverbs in positive verbal groups.

include be, shoul,_...~d or can.

cerned was developed only as far as the flowchart stage. 
Tasks of  c lause CTP 
The pr inc ipa l  task of th i s  CTP i s  to determine the order of" 
sub jec t ,  verb and complements. For ex~ple ,  i f  in  Russian a 
sentence begins with an in t rans i t i ve  verb ,  and the sub ject  
fo l lows ,  the pre fer red  t rans la t ion  depends on the length  of the 
sub jec t -shor t  sub jec ts  can be put  before the verb ,  but  with 
long sub jects  th i s  would not be acceptable in  Eng.lish and some 
exped ient ,  such as the inser t ion  of the dum~ sub jec t  there ,  
must be adopted (e .g .  Then there arose the problem of..----~...

Tasks of noun I verb and ad jec t ive  CTPs 
Apart from cer ta in  inser t ions  (such as ~ before past

~Letioz~ry equivalents are oovered. 
Selection of e~uivalents 
There are five CTPs which select equivalents on ~arious 
grammatical orlterla, usually the role of the item. A typical 
case is that dealing with 'nou~/edjeotives' such as ~pyrom

authors, while rpaww~m ApyroR is translated as boundar~s) 
of another (assueLing, of course, that the analysis has giv~a tJaem 
structures of modifier-head and heed-qualifier respectively). 
Conelusion 
The model and synthesis algorithm described proved 
satisfactory in practical use. They h~ve the advantage that 
translations can be produced when the algorithms are incomplete: 
provided the sub-trees proauced by a partial analysis are linked 
arbitrarily to produce a single sentence structure, this can 
then be explored by a synthesis algorithm, even one in which 
several CTPs are replaced by dummies. As new packages (analysis 
passes or synthesis CTPs) become available they can be incorpor- 
ated very simply. 
The work described above has been carried out at the 
National Physical Laboratory.
