Abstract
In building practical two-way speech-to-speech
translation systems the end user will always wish
to use the system in an environment different from
the original training data. As with all speech sys-
tems, it is important to allow the system to adapt
to the actual usage situations. This paper investi-
gates how a speech-to-speech translation system can
adapt day-to-day from collected data on day one to
improve performance on day two. The platform is
the CMU Iraqi-English portable two-way speech-
to-speech system as developed under the DARPA
TransTac program. We show how machine transla-
tion, speech recognition and overall system perfor-
mance can be improved on day 2 after adapting from
day 1 in both a supervised and unsupervised way.
1 Introduction
As speech-to-speech translation systems move from the
laboratory into field deployment, we quickly see that mis-
match in training data with field use can degrade the per-
formance of the system. Retraining based on field us-
age is a common technique used in all speech systems
to improve performance. In the case of speech-to-speech
translation we would particularly like to be able to adapt
the system based on its usage automatically without hav-
ing to ship data back to the laboratory for retraining. This
paper investigates the scenario of a two-day event. We
wish to improve the system for the second day based on
the data collected on the first day.
Our system is designed for eyes-free use and hence
provides no graphical user interface. This allows the user
to concentrate on his surrounding environment during an
operation. The system only provides audio control and
feedback. Additionally the system operates on a push-to-
talk method. Previously the system (Hsiao et al, 2006;
Bach et al, 2007) needed 2 buttons to operate, one for the
English speaker and the other one for the Iraqi speaker.

Figure 1: The users interact with the system
To make the system easier and faster to use, we propose
to use a single button which can be controlled by the En-
glish speaker. We mounted a microphone and a Wii re-
mote controller together as shown in 1.
Since the Wii controller has an accelerometer which
can be used to detect the orientation of the controller, this
feature can be applied to identify who is speaking. When
the English speaker points towards himself, the system
will switch to English-Iraqi translation. However, when
the Wii is pointed towards somebody else, the system will
switch to Iraqi-English translation. In addition, we attach
a light on the Wii controller providing visual feedback.
This can inform an Iraqi speaker when to start speaking.
The overall system is composed of five major compo-
nents: two automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems,
a bidirectional statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem and two text-to-speech (TTS) systems.
2 Data Scenario
The standard data that is available for the TransTac
project was collected by recording human interpreter
mediated dialogs between war fighters and Iraqi native
speakers in various scenarios. The dialog partners were
aware that the data was being collected for training ma-
chine based translation devices, but would often talk di-
rectly to the human interpreter rather than pretending it
was an automatic device. This means that the dialog
149
partners soon ignored the recording equipment and used
a mostly natural language, using informal pronunciation
and longer sentences with more disfluencies than we find
in machine mediated translation dialogs.
Most users mismatch their language when they com-
municate using an automatic speech-to-speech transla-
tion system. They often switch to a clearer pronuncia-
tion and use shorter and simpler sentences with less dis-
fluency. This change could have a significant impact on
speech recognition and machine translation performance
if a system was originally trained on data from the inter-
preter mediated dialogs.
For this reason, additional data was collected during
the TransTac meeting in June of 2008. This data was
collected with dialog partners using the speech-to-speech
translation systems from 4 developer participants in the
TransTac program. The dialog partners were given a de-
scription of the specific scenario in form of a rough script
and had to speak their sentences into the translation sys-
tems. The dialog partners were not asked to actually react
to the potentially incorrect translations but just followed
the script, ignoring the output of the translation system.
This has the effect that the dialog partners are no longer
talking to a human interpreter, but to a machine, press-
ing push-to-talk buttons etc. and will change their speech
patterns accordingly.
The data was collected over two days, with around 2
hours of actual speech per day. This data was transcribed
and translated, resulting in 864 and 824 utterance pairs
on day 1 and 2, respectively.
3 ASR LM Adaptation
This section describes the Iraqi ASR system and how we
perform LM adaptation on the day 1 data to improve ASR
performance on day 2. The CMU Iraqi ASR system is
trained with around 350 hours of audio data collected un-
der the TransTac program. The acoustic model is speaker
independent but incremental unsupervised MLLR adap-
tation is performed to improve recognition. The acous-
tic model has 6000 codebooks and each codebook has
at most 64 Gaussian mixtures determined by merge-and-
split training. Semi-tied covariance and boosted MMI
discriminative training is performed to improve the model
(Povey et al, 2009). The features for the acoustic model
is the standard 39-dimension MFCC and we concatenate
adjacent 15 frames and perform LDA to reduce the di-
mension to 42 for the final feature vectors. The language
model of the ASR system is a trigram LM trained on the
audio transcripts with around three million words with
Kneser-Ney smoothing (Stolcke, 2002).
To perform LM adaptation for the ASR system, we use
the ASR hypotheses from day 1 to build a LM. This LM
is then interpolated with the original trigram LM to pro-
duce an adapted LM for day 2. We also evaluate the effect
of having transcribers provide accurate transcription ref-
erences for day 1 data, and see how it may improve the
performance on day 2. We compare unigram, bigram and
trigram LMs for adaptation. Since the amount of day 1
data is much smaller than the whole training set and we
do not assume transcription of day 1 is always available,
the interpolation weight is chosen of be 0.9 for the orig-
inal trigram LM and 0.1 for the new LM built from the
day 1 data. The WER of baseline ASR system on day 1
is 32.0%.

Table 1: Iraqi ASR?s WER on day 2 using different adaptation
schemes for day 1 data
The results in Table 1 show that the ASR benefits from
LM adaptation. Adapting day 1 data can slightly improve
the performance of day 2. The improvement is larger
when day 1 transcript is available which is expected. The
result also shows that the unigram LM is the most robust
model for adaptation as it works reasonably well when
transcripts are not available, whereas bigram and trigram
LM are more sensitive to the ASR errors made on day 1.

Unsupervised ASR adaptation 31.55 27.66
Supervised ASR adaptation 32.19 27.65
Table 2: Impact of ASR adaptation to SMT
Table 2 shows the impact of ASR adaptation on the
performance of the translation system in BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2002). In these experiments we only performed
adaptation on ASR and still using the baseline SMT com-
ponent. There is no obvious difference between unsuper-
vised and supervised ASR adaptation on performance of
SMT on day 2. However, we can see that the difference
in WER on day 2 of unsupervised and supervised ASR
adaptation is relatively small.
4 SMT Adaptation
The Iraqi-English SMT system is trained with around
650K sentence pairs collected under the TransTac pro-
gram. We used PESA phrase extraction (Vogel, 2005)
and a suffix array language model (Zhang and Vogel,
2005). To adapt SMT components one approach is to op-
timize LM interpolation weights by minimizing perplex-
ity of the 1-best translation output (Bulyko et al, 2007).
Related work including (Eck et al, 2004) attempts to use
information retrieval to select training sentences similar
to those in the test set. To adapt the SMT components
we use a domain-specific LM on top of the background
150
language models. This approach is similar to the work
in (Chen et al, 2008). sThe adaptation framework is 1)
create a domain-specific LM via an n-best list of day 1
machine translation hypothesis, or day 1 translation ref-
erences; 2) re-tune the translation system on day 1 via
minimum error rate training (MERT) (Venugopal and Vo-
gel, 2005).

Table 3: Performance in BLEU of unsupervised adaptation.
The first question we would like to address is whether
our adaptation obtains improvements via an unsupervised
manner. We take day 1 baseline ASR hypothesis and use
the baseline SMT to get the MT hypothesis and a 500-
best list. We train a domain LM using the 500-best list
and use the MT hypotheses as the reference in MERT. We
treat day 1 as a development set and day 2 as an unseen
test set. In Table 3 we compare the performance of four
systems: the baseline which does not have any adaptation
steps; and 3 adapted systems using unigram, bigram and
trigram LMs build from 500-best MT hypotheses.

Table 4: Performance in BLEU of supervised adaptation.
Experimental results from unsupervised adaptation did
not show consistent improvements but suggest we may
obtain gains via supervised adaptation. In supervised
adaptation, we assume we have day 1 translation refer-
ences. The references are used in MERT. In Table 4 we
show performances of two additional systems which are
the baseline system without adaptation but tuned toward
day 1, and the adapted system which used day 1 trans-
lation references to train a unigram LM (1gramLM MT
Ref). The unigram and bigram LMs from 500-best and
unigram LM from MT day 1 references perform rela-
tively similar on day 2. Using a trigram 500-best LM
returned a large degradation and this LM is sensitive to
the translation errors on day1
5 Joint Adaptation
In Sections 3 and 4 we saw that individual adaptation
helps ASR to reduce WER and SMT to increase BLEU

score. The next step in validating the adaptation frame-
work was to check if the joint adaptation of ASR and
SMT on day 1 data will lead to improvements on day
2. Table 5 shows the combination of ASR and SMT
adaptation methods. Improvements are obtained by us-
ing both ASR and SMT adaptation. Joint adaptation con-
sistently gained more than one BLEU point improvement
on day 2. Our best system is unsupervised ASR adapta-
tion via 1gramLM of ASR day 1 transcription coupled
with supervised SMT adaptation via 1gramLM of day
1 translation references. An interesting result is that to
have a better result on day 2 our approach only requires
translation references on day 1. We selected 1gramLM
of 500-best MT hypotheses to conduct the experiments
since there is no significant difference between 1gramLM
and 2gramLM on day 2 as showed in Table 3.
6 Selective Adaptation
The previous results indicate that we require human
translation references on day 1 data to get improved per-
formance on day 2. However, our goal is to make a better
system on day 2 but try to minimize human efforts on day
1. Therefore, we raise two questions: 1) Can we still ob-
tain improvements by not using all of day 1 data? and 2)
Can we obtain more improvements?
To answer these questions we performed oracle exper-
iments when we take the translation hypotheses on day
1 of the baseline SMT and compare them with transla-
tion references, then select sentences which have BLEU
scores higher than a threshold. The subset of day 1 sen-
tences is used to perform supervised adaptation in a sim-
ilar way showed in section 5. These experiments also
simulate the situation when we have a perfect confidence
score for machine translation hypothesis selection. Table
6 shows results when we use various portions of day 1 to
perform adaptation. By using day 1 sentences which have
smoothed sentence BLEU scores higher than 10 or 20 we
have very close performance with adaptation by using all
day 1 data. The results also show that by using 416 sen-
tences which have sentence BLEU score higher than 40
on day 1, our adapted translation components outperform
the baseline. Performance starts degrading after 50. Ex-
perimental results lead to the answer for question 1) that
151
by using less day 1 data our adapted translation compo-
nents still obtain improvements compare with the base-
line, and 2) we did not see that using less data will lead
us to a better performance compare with using all day 1
data.

7 Conclusions
This work clearly shows that improvement is possible us-
ing collected data for adaptation. The overall picture is
shown in Figure 2. However this result is only based on
one such data set, it would be useful to do such adaptation
over multiple days. The best results however still require
producing translation references, notably ASR transcrip-
tions do not seem to help, but may still be required in the
process of generating translation references. We wish to
further investigate automatic adaptation based on implicit
confidence scores, or even active participation of the user
e.g. by marking bad utterance which could be excluded
from the adaptation.
