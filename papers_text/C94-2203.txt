recognized in (Jhinese litera.turc, i.e. mull, f- 
S(~llS( ~, combinations and interse(;1;ion coral)i- 
nactions (\]hlallg a,lid Liu, 1988). The sl, ring 
1245 
;~N is an example of multi-sense combination; 
(ice), ~I(box) and ~N(refrigerator) are all 
words. The character string ~f lN is an exam- 
ple of intersection combination; Ntfl(paddle) 
is a word and ~fl~(sell.-at-sate-price) s also a 
word, whereas tfl is the intersection charac- 
ter. The example of the string ~ f l ~  f 
illustrates the typical segmentation ambigu- 
ity caused by word chains. The segmentation 
of this string can be either 
(fl'hc ping-pong-balLs were soht outat sale 
price.) or 
('13e paddles for gable tennis were sold out.) 
Some ambiguities can be solved by word 
structure knowledge. Others can be disam- 
biguated by syntactic and/or semantic knowl- 
edge. The most difficult disambiguation is
that requiring contextual or pragmatic knowl-- 
edge to arrive at an appropriate interpreta- 
tion a,s in the string ~ ~ t  which can be 
segmented into: 
(students will write a paper.) or 
(student-association writes a paper'.) 
Both are syntactically and semantically cor- 
rect. in this case, contextual information 
would allow the reader to trace the informa- 
tion claimed in the previous statements to 
solve ambiguity problems. 
3 Reasoning theory for 
Chinese segmentation 
disambiguation 
A model of evidential strength in inexact 
reasoning studied by (Buchanan and Short- 
liffe, 1984) has been successfully implemented 
in the MYCIN system. Tihe theory is that, 
if a hypothesis can be derived from various 
types of mutually exclusive vidence, then the 
strength of truth of the hypothesis can be in- 
creased to reach a plausible conclusion. 
Two concepts MB\[h,e\] and Ml)\[h,e\] have 
been introduced as the measures of belief and 
disbelief. MB\[h,e\] means the measure of in- 
creased belief in the hypothesis h, based on 
the evidence . M l)\[h,e\] means the measure o\[ 
increased isbelief in the hypothesis h, based 
on the evidence c. To facilitate comparison 
of the evidential strength of competing hy- 
potheses, certainty factor CF is introduced to 
combine degrees of belief and disbelief as fop 
\]OWS: 
csqh ,  ~1 = M l~\[t~, e\] - MY\ [h ,  c\] 
in the case that a hypothesis is derived froIn 
a number of mutually exclusive observations, 
the combining functions are defined as: 
if MD\[h, el&,e2\] = 1 
then MB\[h, el&,e2\] = 0 
otherwise 
M l:~\[h, el&,c2\] 
= MB\[h ,  e~\] + M, \ [h ,  e~\] ? (:l - MY\[h ,  e,\]) 
if M13\[h, el&e2\] = 1 
then MD\[h, cl&c~2\] = 0 
otherwise 
M D\[h, cl &c2\] 
= MD\[h,e~,\] + MI)\[h, e2\], (l - mD\[h, ej\]) 
In the case that two hypotheses are estab- 
lished with positive evidence from syntactic 
and semantic knowledge with the same de- 
gree, no discrimination of the strength of 
truth hypotheses can be drawn. If world 
knowledge provides positive evidence for the 
first hypothesis and negative vidence to the 
second; then the strength of the first hypothe- 
sis is stronger than thai; of the second. There- 
fore, the first hypothesis would be the most 
likely correct segmentation. 
A weighted certainty factor is proposed 
he, re to represent he importance of various 
linguistic aspects. The, weight is a vector of 
four elements representing the importance of 
morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmat- 
its, respectively, which total 1, i.e. 
Cl,;\[h,, e\] - w~ , CF\ [h ,  ~\] 
where Wi is the weight of the certainty fac-- 
tor CFi in hypothesis h supported by the ev- 
idence e with respect o one of the linguistic

Therefore, this segmentation is unlikely to be 
a coherent; string. 
4 D iscuss ion  
q_'he assignment for the weight vector is 
empirical. It is based on the following analy- 
sis in which ~l's reresent the truth of each evi- 
dence/hypothesis and ~O's represent the false. 
Since the segmentation algorithm always pro- 
duces a segmented string, it is assumed that 
the evidence from morphology is true in vary- 
ing degrees depending on the complexity of 
the word chain. The justification of a hy- 
pothesis is based on the evidence presented 
by the pragmatic, semantic and syntactic as- 
pects shown in the following table. 
~-~ J pragmte I semte I s-sTfitC- 
(1) 0 0 0 
(2) 0 0 
(3) o o 
(4) 0 1 1

? Case(l) indicates that if no evidence can 
prove the truth of the hypothesis, then 
the hypothesis i false. 
? Case(2) indicates that if the evi- 
dence supports an incoherent grarumat- 
ical sentence inconsistent with the con- 
text/circumstance, then the hypothesis 
is false as in the case of ~ ,g~-~(a  ba- 
nana ate a monkey). 
? Case(3) indicates that if the evidence 
supports a meaningful but ungrammat- 
ical string inconsistent with the con- 
text/circumstance, then the hypothesis 
is false, i.e. ~g~ (he wretch) against 
the real fact that he is a nice guy. 
? Case(4) indicates that even if tile evi- 
dence supports a grammatical meaning- 
ful sentence but is inconsistent with the 
context/circumstance, then tile hypoth- 
esis is false, i.e., ,~,(~ 7vN ~ ~ N (the 
president's forced resignation makes peo- 
ple angry) violates the circumstance that 
people hate the president. 
? Case(5) indicates the case of an idiomatic 
expression where the string is literally 
ungrammatical nd incoherent, but as a 
whole it can be interpreted figuratively 
to make perfect sense. Therefore, we as- 
sutTrle that the hypothesis is true as in 
tile case of :~z~I:~J?, literally means "car- 
water-horse--dragon", but figuratively, it 
n leans  "very crowded". 
? Case(6) indicates the case of a metaphor 
or metonymy which superficially it is 
an incoherent grammatical string, but 
by reasoning with the support of world 
knowledge it can be interpreted as a 
lneaninghd string. Then, it is assumed 
that the hypothesis is true, i.e., ~NN~g 
~t (1 drink North-West wind) means "i 
have nothing to eat". 
? Case(7) indicates that the evidence sup- 
ports a meaningful but ungrammat- 
ical string consistent with the con- 
text/circumstance, then the hypothesis 
is true as in Nla;lti (he wretch) is consis- 
tent with the real fact that he is a bad 
guy. 
? Case(8) indicates that if all evidence 
gives positive support to the hypothesis, 
then tile hypothesis i true. 
1)Yore the analysis, it seems to be that 
pragmatic knowledge provides the strongest 
evidence for the hypothesis. Therefore, 
the highest weight is assigned to the prag- 
matic aspect of the certainty factor, in 
the absence of pragmatic inforrnation a de- 
fault assumption, that semantic evidence is 
more important han syntactic evidence, is 
made. This can he observed in daily life 
people communicate through many ungram- 
matical expressions without having a prob- 
lem of transferring the message such as a 
brief email message: ~ DRAFT-cornmerzts 
hard copy best-asap to yw pls. \[t means "To 
1A brief e_mail message from Dr. Yorick Wilks to 
the researchers in Computing |{esearch I,aboratory at 
New Mexico State University. 
"/248 
write the, comment for the Ill{AFT on the 
ha.rd COl)y would be the best. Please return it 
to Yorick Wilks ~s soon as possible." 
The certainty factor Cl;' ix used under the 
premise tha,t a,ll of I;he evide, nce is rendered by 
mutua, lly exclusive observations. Sitice lem- 
guage is a,n expression integr~ting synl;actic, 
semantic and pr~Lgmatic information, is the 
syntat:ti(:, sema,nti(: a,n(\[ I)r~gmatic evid(mce 
mutually exclusive? This is not so (:lca,r. All 
knowledge is cultur~dly (tel)e~l.d(mt , i.e. one 
paN;ieular instance m~y be ~meepta, b\]e in one 
culture but not in a,nothe, r. In this research a
defmflt assumption is made that the obserw> 
tions from various language ast)ects are inde- 
pendent. The questioa is left ope, for further 
discussiou.
