ABSTRACT 
The paper character izes natural lang- 
uage inferencing in the TIBAQ method of 
question-answering, focussing on three asp- 
ects: ~i) speci f icat ion of the structures 
on which the inference rules operate, (ii) 
c lass i f icat ion of the rules that have been 
formulated and implemented up to now, 
according to the kind of modi f icat ion of 
the input structure ti~e rules invoke, an~ 
(iii) d iscussion of some points in which 
a prover ly designed inference procedure 
may help the searc~ of the answer, and 
vice versa. 
I SPECIFICATION OF THE I:~PUT STRUCTURES 
FOR INFE~ENC I\[IG 
A. Outl ine of the TIBAQ ~lethod 
hhen the TIBA~ (~ext-and-~nference 
based ~nswer ing of ~uest ions)  project was 
~esigned, main emphasis was laid on the 
automatic bui ld-up of the stock of know- 
ledge from the (non-~re-edited% input text. 
The exper imental  system based 6n this meth- 
od converses automat ica l ly  the natural 
language input (both the quest ions and new 
Fieces of information, i.e. Czech sentences 
in their usual form) into the reDresentat-  
ions of n,eaning (tectogranmlatical repres- 
entations, TR's\]; these TR's serve as input 
structures for the inference procedure tilat 
enriches the set of TR's selected by the 
system itself as possibly relevant for an 
answer to the input question. In this en- 
r iched set suitable TR's for direct and in- 
direct answers to the given quest ion are 
retrieved, and then transfered by a synth- 
esis procedure into the output (surface) 
form if sentences (for an outl ine of the 
method as such, see Haji~ov~, 197~; 3aji~o- 
v~ and Sgall, 19~i; Sgall, 1982). 
B. :?hat Kind of Structure Inferences ~houl~i 
Be Based on 
To decide what kind of structures the 
inference procedure should operate, one has 
to take into account several criteria, some 
of which seemingly contradict  each other: 
the structures should be as simple and 
transparent as possible, so that inferenc- 
ing can be perfor,ued in a wel l -def ined way, 
and at the s~e ti~ue, these structures 
~hould be as"exDress ive"as the natural lang- 
uage sentences are, not to lose any piece 
of information captured by the text. 
"~atural language has a major draw- 
back in its ambiguity: when a l istener is 
told that the criticisl~ of the Pol ish del-  
egate was fully justif ied, one does not 
know (unless indicated by the context or 
situation) whether s/he should infer that 
soE~eone cr i t ic ized the Pol ish delegate, or 
whether the Pol ish delegate cr i t ic ized 
someone/something.  On the other hand, there 
are means in natural  language that are not 
preserved by most languages that log ic ians  
have used for drawing consequences, but 
that are cr i t ical  for the latter to be 
drawn correctly: when a l istener is told 
that ~ussiau is ~poken in SIBERIA, s/he 
draws conclusions part ly d i f ferent  from 
those when s/he is told that in Siberla, 
RUS3IAN is spoken (caoitals denot ing the 
intonation center); or, to borrow one of 
the widely d iscussed examples in l inguist-  
ic writ ings,  if one hears that Jonn cal led 
:ary a ~U~LICA~ and that then she insult- 
ed I~IM, one should infer that the sneaker 
considers "being a ~eoubl ican" an insult~ 
this is not the case, if the speaker said 
that then she I~SULTED hi~. 
These and similar cons iderat ions have 
led the authors of T IDAn to a stronc con- 
v ict ion that the structures represent ing 
F.nowledge and serving as the base for in- 
ferencing in a q-uestion-answerin\[~ system 
with a natural  language interface should 
be l inguist ica l ly  based: they should be de- 
prived of all ambiguit ies of natural  lang- 
uage and at the same til:ie they should pre- 
serve all the information relevant for 
drawing conclus ions that the natural lanci- 
uage sentences encompass. The exr.erir,~ental

C. l ectocrar.~n~tical ~eor:_'sentations 
One of the b~sic tenets  of VGD is 
the ar t i cu la t ion  of the sc'~antic re lat ion,  
i.e. th_- re la t ion  bet.:een sound and r,~ean-

As for a forn~al spec i f i ca t ion  of the

Coming back to the not ions  of e lem-

they can be classifie,i into two groups.  
Grammatemes  represent ing  morpho log ica l  
rleanin C in the nar row sense are spec i f ic  
for d i f fe rent  (semantic) word c lasses:  for 
nouns, w~ d is t ingu ish  grammatemes  of num- 
ber an~ of de l imi ta t ion  ( indef in i te ,  def -  
inite, spec i fy ing) : fo r  ad jec t ives  and ad-  
verbs,  g rammate~es  of degree,  for verbs,  
we work wi th  grammatemes  of aspect  (pro- 
cessual ,  complex,  resu l ta t ive) ,  i te ra t ive -  
hess ( i terat ive,  non- i te ra t ive) ,  tense 
(s imul taneous,  anter ior ,  poster io r ) ,  im- 
:nediateness ( immediate,  non-- immediate),  
p red icate  moda l i ty  ( ind icat ive,  Doss ib i l -

ive moda l i ty  (af f i rmat ive,  negative), and 
sentent ia l  moda l i ty  ( iec larat ive,  inter -  
rogat ive ,  imperat ive) .  The other  group o~ 
gr~mmatemes  is not - w i th  some except ions  - 
%~ord-class spec i f i c  and s imi la r ly  as the 
set of the types of complementat ions  is 
c lose ly  connected  wi th  the k inds  of the 
dependency  re la t ions  between the governor  
and the dependent  node; thus the Locat ive  
is accom}~anied by one member  of the set 
{in, on, under,  between . . . .  \]. 
%'he dependency  re la t ions  are very  
r ich and var ied,  and it is no wonder  that 
there were many e f fo r ts  to c lass i fy  them. 
In FGD, a , lear  boundary  is be ing made be- 
tween -~t Jc ipants  (deep cases) and( f ree)  
mod i f i ca t ions :  par t i c ipants  are those com- 
!~lementations that can occur  w i th  the same 
verb token on ly  once and that have to be 
sr~uci~ied for each verb (and s imi la r ly  for 
each noun, ad ject ive ,  etc.) ,  whi le  free 
mod i f i ca t ions  are those comolementat ions  
that may appear  more than once w i th  the 
same verb token and that can be l i s ted  for 
all the verbs  once for all; for a ~ore

Panevov~,  in press;  Ha j i~ov~,  1977; 1983. 
Doth ;~articipants and mod i f i ca t ions  can 
be (semant ica l ly)  opt iona l  or ob l igatory ;  
~oth opt iona l  and ob l igatory  oar t i c iDants  
are to be stated in the case f rames of 
verbs,  whi le  mod i f i ca t io rs  be long  there 
only  wi th  such verbs  wi th  wh ich  they are

In the nresent  vers ion  of FGD, the

In our discussion on types of complementat-  
ions we have up to now concentrated on comp- 
lementations of verbs; with Zhe FGD frame- 
work, however, all word classes have their 
frames. Specif ic to nouns (cf. Pi\[ha, 1980), 
there is the part it ive part ic ipant (a glass 
of water) and the free modif icat ions of 
appurtenance (a leg of the table\], of gen- 
eral relat ionship (nice weather), of ident- 
ity (the city of Prague\] and of a descr ipt-  
ive attr ibute (golden Prague). 
To i l lustrate the structure of the re- 
presentat ion on the tectogrammatical  level 
of FG;), we present in Fi~. $ a com21ex de- 
pendency structure of one of the readings of 
of the sentence "Before the ~ar began, 
Charles l ived in P~AGUE and Jane in BFRLIN" 
(which it has in cormnon with "Before the be- 
ginning of the war, Charles lived in PRAGUE

II INFERENCE TYPES 
A. \[q_eans of Implementation 
The inference rules are progranm~ed 
in 9-1anguage (Colmerauer, 1982), which 
provides rules that carry out transforr~at~ 
ions of oriented graphs. Since the struct- 
ures accepted by the rules must not con- 
tain complex labels, every complex sy~bol 
label l ing a no~e in WR's has the form of a 
whole subtree in the Q-language notation 
(in a "~-tree). 
The set of TR's constitutes a seman- 
tic network, in which the individu~l T!{'s 
are connected into a com\[~lex whole hy 
means of pointers between tl\]e occurrences 
of lexical units and the corresponding 
entries in the lexicon. (Ouestions of dif- 
ferent objects of the same kind referred 
to in di f ferent TR's wil l  be handled only 
in the future ex\]~eriments.) 
The fol lowing procedures eperate o~n 
TI{ "s : 
(i\] the extract ion of (possibly\] relevant 
pieces of information from the stock 
of kno,:?led~e ; 
(ii\] the appl icat ion of inference rules on 
the relevant }?ieces of information, 
(iii) the retr ieval of the answer(s). 
'\]:he extract ion of the so-calleE rs- 
levant .~J~c,~s of inforT~'.~tion is based on 
~:atcbing the. ~"~.-. of the input question with 
the lexicon and extracti~,~ khos?: Y\[''<~ that 
intersect with the Tq o~ the give,: questi-  
on in at least one s~-.ecific 1 ..... ~c~_ v~lue 
(i.e. other than the"g~nerl l  %ztor, -~.,:.

source TR as well as the derived TR consti-  
tute a part of the stock of knowledge a,,d 
a,, serve as source TR s for further pro- 
cessing. In order to avoid infinite cycles, 
the whole proced :r= oI inferencing is div- 
ided into several Q-systems (notice that 
rules within a single Q-system are appl ied 
s ~o,:g as the condit ions for their appl ic-  
ation are fulfi l led, i.e. there is no order- 
ing of the rules ). 
E. Types of Inference Rules 
I. Rules operat in@ on a single TR: 
(i) the structure of the tree is preserv- 
ed; the transformation concerns only (a) 
part(s) of the .o..p~ex symbol of some node 
of the CDS (i.e. label(s) of some node(s) in 
the Q-tree of the TR): 
(a) change of a grammateme: 
V exform-POssib (Ndevice-ACt) 
(X-Pat) ... == 
Vperform-lndic INdevice -Act) 
~X-Pat) ... 
A0te:, In our highly s impl i f ied and 
schematic shapes of the rules we quote 
only thos~ labels of the nodes that 
are relevlnt for the rule in question; 
the sign == stands for "rewrite as"; 
Ndevice stands for any no~n ,,i%h the 
sem~,~t?u f=ature of "device", Vperfor  m 
for a verb with the semantic feature 
of action ve?b=, ~ossib and II~dic de- 
note the |raimnatemes of predicate mod- 
ality. 
E x.: An implif ier can act ivate a Das,-- 
ive network to form an active analogue. 
== An ampl i f ier  activates a passive 
network to form an active anal~gue. 
(b) change of a functor (type of complement-  
ation): 
V-use (Ni-Pat) (Nj-Accomp) ... == 
V-use (Ni-Regard) (~j-Pat) ... 
E__{x.: Operat ional  amplif ier is used with 
negative feedback. == With operational  
a,uplifier negative feedback is used. 
Vperfor m LNi-Act ) (Nj-Pat) ... == 
Vperfor m (Dgen-ACt) (~li-Instr) (Nj-Pat).. 
E x.: Operat ional  amplif iers perform 
mathematical  operat ions == Mathematic-  
al operations are performed by means 
of operat ional  amplif iers. 
Note: Act, Pat, Instr, Accomp, Reg- 
ard stand for the functors of Actor, 
Patient, Instrument, Accompaniment 
and Regard, respectively; D denot-  
es a general part ic ipant,  gen 
~g~ change of the lexical part of the comp- 
lex symbol accompanied by a change of 
some gramnlateme or functor: 
V.-Possibl ((few)Ni) (V-use(Nk-ACc?mpneg) 
...)... ==Vi-Necess ((most)Ni) (V-use 
( Nk-ACcompposit) . . . ) . . .  
Ex.: With few hlgh-performance oper-  
a-~ional ampl i f iers it is possible to 
maintain a l inear re lat ionship betw- 
een input and output without employ- 
ing negative feedback.== Hith most 
&i. it is necessary to mainta in ... 
employing negative feedback. 
(ii) a whole subtree is replaced by another 
subtree: 
Ex.: a negative feedback == a negat- 
ive feedback circuit  
(iii) extract ion of a subtree to create an 
independent TR: 
- relat ive clause in the topic part 
of the TR 
V i (Vj-Gener-L(. . . )) . . .  == 
Vj -Gener-L  (...) 
Ex.: An operat ional  amplif ier,  which 
a--~tivates a passive network to form 
an active analogue, is an unusual ly  
versat i le device. == An operat ional  
ampl i f ier  act ivates a passive net- 
work to form an active analogue. 
Note: L stands for the grammateme 
"contextual ly bound", R for "non- 
-bound", Gener for the functor of 
general relat ionship. 
- causal clause in TR's with aff i r -  
mative modal i ty  
V i -Af f i rm (Vj-Cause (...))... == 
vj t . . . )  
EX.: Since an operat ional  ampl i f ier  
i-~ designed to perform mathematical  
operations, such basic operat ions 
as ... are performed readily. == 
An operat ional  ampli f ier is designed 
to perform mathematical  operations. 
- delet ion of an attr ibute in the 
focus part of a TR 
V i (Nj-R (X-Gener-R)) 
V i (Nj-R) ... 
i 6 0 
294 
E_~x.: Operat ional  ampl i f iers  are used 
as regulators ... to minimize load- 
ing of reference ~\] iod~ vermit t lng 
full explo i tat ion of the diode's 
precis ion temperature stabil ity. == 
Operat ional  ampl i f iers  are used as 
regulators ... to minimize loading 
of reference diodes. 
(iv) the t ransformat ion gives r ise to two 
TR s 
d ist r ibut iv i ty  of conjunct ion and 
dis junct ion (under certain condit-  
ions: e.g. for the d is t r ibut iv i ty  
of d is junct ion to hold, the gramm- 
ateme of Indic with the main verb 
is replaced by the grammateme of 
Possib) 
E x.: Operat ional  ampl i f iers  are used 
in active fi lter networks to provide 
gain and frequency select ivity.  == 
Operat inal  ampl i f iers  are used in 
active fi lter networks to provide 
gain. Operat ional  ampl i f iBrs  are 
used in act ive networks to provide 
frequency selectivity. 
2. Rules operat in 9 (simultaneously) on two 
TR s 
left-hand side of the rule refers 
to two TR's) 
- conjoining of TR's with the same 
Actor 
Ex.: An operat ional  ampl i f ier  act- 
ivates a passive network to form an 
active analogue. An operat ional  
ampl i f ier  performs mathemat ica l  op- 
erations. =~ An operat ional  ampl i f -  
ier act ivates .... and performs .... 
use of def init ions:  the rule is 
tr iggered by the presence of an as- 
sert ion of the form "X is cal led Y" 
and subst itutes all occurrences of 
the lex~cal labels X in all TR's by 
the lexical label Y 
III EFFECTIVE LINKS BETWEEN INFERENCING 
AND ANSWER RETRIEVAL 
A. The Retr ieval  Procedure 
Th~ retr ieval  of an answer in the en- 
r iched set of assert ions (TR's) is perform- 
ed in the fol lowing stepsl 
(a) f irst it is checked whether the 
lexical value of the root of the TR is id- 
entical with that of the TR of the question; 
if the quest ion has the form "What is per- 
formed (done, carr ied out) by X?", then 
the TR from the enr iched set must include 
an act ion verb as a label of its root; 
(b) the path leading from the root to the 
wh-word is checked (yes-no quest ions a re .  
excluded from the f irst stage of our exper- 
iments); the r ightmost path in the relevant 
TR must coincide with the wh-path in its 
lexical  labels, contextual--boundness, 
grammatemes and functors (with some poss- 
ible deviat ions determined by condit ions 
of subst i tutabi l i ty:  Singular - Plural, 
Manner - Accompaniment,  etc.); the wh-word 
in the quest ion must be matched by ~- lex-  
ical unit of the potent ia l  answer, where 
the latter may be further expanded; 
(c~ if also the rest of the two compared 
TR s meet the condit ions of identity or 
subst i tutabi l i ty,  the relevant TR is mark- 
ed as a full answer to the given question; 
if this is not the case but at least one 
of the nodes depending on a node included 
in the wh-path meets these condit ions,  then 
the re levant TR is marked as an indirect 
(partial) answer. 
B. Towards an E f fec t ive  App l i ca t ion  o f  
In fe rence  Ru les  
In the course of the exper iments it 
soon became clear that even with a very 
l imited number of inference rules the mem- 
ory space was rapidly exceeded. It was 
then necessary to find a way how to achie- 
ve an ef fect ive appl icat ion of the inferen- 
ce rules and at the same time not to re- 
strict the choice of re levant answers .  
Among other things, the fo l lowing issues 
should be taken into considerat ion: 
The rules subst i tut ing subtrees for 
subtrees are used rather frequently, as 
well as those subst i tut ing only a label 
of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one ele- 
ment of the complex symbol in the CDS), 
preserv ing the overal l  structure of the 
tree untouched. These rules operate in 
both direct ions,  so that it appears as use- 
ful to use in such cases a similar strat- 
egy as with synonymous expressions,  i.e. 
to decide on a single representat ion both 
in the TR of the quest ion and that includ- 
ed in the stock of knowledge; this would 
lead to an important decrease of the num- 
ber of TR's that undergo further inference 
transformations.  
Only those TR's are selected for the 
final steps of the retr ieval  of the answer 
(see point (a) in III.A) that coincide 
with the TR of the quest ion in the lexical  
label of the root, i.e. the main verb. If 
the inference rules are ordered in such a 
way that the rules changing an element of 
the label of the root are appl ied before 
the rest of the rules, then the first 
step of the retr ieval  procedure can be 
made before the appl icat ion of other in- 
ference rules. This again leads to a con- 
295 
siderable reduct ion of the number of TR's 
on which the rest of the inference rules 
are applied; only such TR's are left in the 
stock of relevant TR's 
(i)that agree with the TR of the quest ion 
in the label of the root (its ~exical lab- 
el may belong to superordinated or subord- 
inated lexioal values: device - amplif ier, 
etc.), 
(ii) that i~clude the lexical label of 
the root oC the question in some other 
place than at the root of the relevant 
TR, 
(iii) if the quest ion has the form "Which 
N " (i.e the wh-n~de depends on its ? o -  , o 
head in the relat ion of general relat ion- 
ship), then also those TR's are preserved 
that contain an identical N node (noun) 
on any level of the tree. 
The use of Q- language brings about 
one diff iculty, namely that the rules 
have to be formulated for each level for 
the tree separately. It is possible to 
avoid this compl icat ion by a simple tempor- 
ary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which re- 
sults in a tree in which all nodes with 
lexical labels are on the same level; the 
rules for a subst itut ion of the lexical 
labels can be then applied in one step, 
after which the tree is "returned" into 
its or iginal  shape. 
These and similar considerat ions have 
led us to the fol lowing ordering of the in- 
d iv idual  steps of the inference and retr ie- 
val procedure: 
I. appl icat ion of rules transforming 
the input structure to such an extent that 
the lexlcal label of the root of the tree 
is not preserved in the tree of a potent- 
ial answer; 
2. a partial retr ieval of the answer 
according to the root of the tree; 
3. appl icat ion of rules subst i tut ing 
other labels pert inent to the root of the 
tree; 
4. partial retr ieval of the answer 
according to the root of the tree; 
5. appl icat ion of inference rules 
operat inq on a single tree; 
6. appl icat ion of inference rules 
operat ing on two trees; 
7. the steps (b) and (c) from the 
retr ieval of the answer (see II I .A above).
