INTRODUCTION 
This session focussed on robustness in speech recognition. 
The first two papers considered the effects of working with a 
population of real users in telephone-services environments, 
while the final two papers looked at front-end technologies, 
namely microphone arrays and representations of acoustic 
information. 
SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS AND 
DISCUSSION 
The first paper, "Field Test Evaluations and Optimizations of 
Speaker Independent Speech Recognition for Telephone 
Applications," by Gagnoulet and Sorin of CNET, was presented 
by Christel Sorin. This paper discussed various ways of 
improving system usability and performance by optimizing 
both the dialog ergonomy and the recognition technology 
within the constraints of low-cost real-time implementation. 
Techniques discussed included use of field data in training, 
increasing the number of parameters, automatic adjustments of
the HMM structure, and better ejection procedures. A brief 
discussion of the rejection rate versus error rate tradeoff ensued; 
nobody had any good data or ideas on how to make this 
tradeoff, so when one person suggested that the rejection rate 
should be adjusted to keep the error rate under 5 percent, we said 
OK and moved on. 
The second paper, "Collection and Analysis of Data From 
Real Users: Impl icat ions for Speech Recognit ion/  
Understanding Systems," by Judith Spitz and the AI Speech 
group at NYNEX, concentrated on analyzing user response 
characteristics as a function of the prompts used, and on 
comparing user versus laboratory speech characteristics with 
respect o their effects on recognition performance. Since 
NYNEX has gone to the trouble of collecting lots of good data, 
including TIM\[I" data run through the telephone network, there 
was some discussion of the possibility of distributing some of 
their data, such as the Network-TIMrr data and telephone 
services data, through NIST. Legal issues are the most serious 
problem at this point for the telephone services data, since it is 
not possible to get explicit consent from the talkers. 
The third paper, "Autodirective Microphone Systems for 
Natural Communication with Speech Recognizers," by 
Flanagan, Mammone, and Elko of Rutgers University, was 
presented by Jim Flanagan. He surveyed recent advances and 
opportunities in steerable-beam icrophone arrays with 
automatic source tracking. An audio tape demonstrated 
excellent-quality recording from a single speaker in a 300-seat 
auditorium using a 2D array on the ceiling. A video tape 
showed the 1D array used in the HuManNet system. The relative 
merits of noise cancellation filters and steerable beams were 
discussed, and it was suggested that noise cancellation may 
actually be a much more useful technique when combined with a 
steerable microphone array. 
The final paper, "Signal Representation, Attribute 
Extraction, and the Use of Distinctive Features for Phonetic 
Classification," by Meng, Zue, and Leung of MIT's Laboratory 
for Computer Science, was presented by Helen Meng. This 
presentation covered results of careful experimental 
comparisons of different front-end representations (e.g. 
auditory, Mel-cepstrum, DFT, etc.) and various ways of 
incorporating acoustic attributes and distinctive features, in the 
context of multilayer peroeptron based vowel classification. 
The dual auditory model (mean rate plus synchrony 
representations) worked best as the front end (especially in 
noise, but by an insignificant margin in some other cases). 
Significant computational savings was possible by reducing 
the front-end output o a few simple acoustic attributes, and the 
loss in accuracy was small and probably insignificant. Using 
distinctive features was said to provide for the possibility of 
better phonological-level generalization; the loss in accuracy 
of incorporating features (followed by a second MLP to do the 
phoneme classification) was not significant. Discussion 
followed on possible explanations for why the auditory model 
works as well as it does; nobody had a sukable xplanation, but 
the conjecture that it was primarily due to the synchrony 
information was shown to be not supported by the data, since 
the rate-only model worked almost as well.
