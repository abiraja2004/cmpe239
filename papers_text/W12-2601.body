Abstract
Automatic evaluation has greatly facilitated
system development in summarization. At the
same time, the use of automatic evaluation
has been viewed with mistrust by many, as its
accuracy and correct application are not well
understood. In this paper we provide an as-
sessment of the automatic evaluations used for
multi-document summarization of news. We
outline our recommendations about how any
evaluation, manual or automatic, should be
used to find statistically significant differences
between summarization systems. We identify
the reference automatic evaluation metrics?
ROUGE 1 and 2?that appear to best emu-
late human pyramid and responsiveness scores
on four years of NIST evaluations. We then
demonstrate the accuracy of these metrics in
reproducing human judgements about the rel-
ative content quality of pairs of systems and
present an empirical assessment of the rela-
tionship between statistically significant dif-
ferences between systems according to man-
ual evaluations, and the difference according
to automatic evaluations. Finally, we present a
case study of how new metrics should be com-
pared to the reference evaluation, as we search
for even more accurate automatic measures.
1 Introduction
Automatic evaluation of content selection in sum-
marization, particularly the ROUGE evaluation
toolkit (Lin and Hovy, 2003), has been enthusias-
tically adopted by researchers since its introduction
in 2003. It is now standardly used to report results in
publications; however we have a poor understanding
of the accuracy of automatic evaluation. How often
do we publish papers where we report an improve-
ment according to automatic evaluation, but never-
theless, a standard manual evaluation would have led
us to different conclusions? In our work we directly
address this question, and hope that our encouraging
findings contribute to a better understanding of the
strengths and shortcomings of automatic evaluation.
The aim of this paper is to give a better assessment
of the automatic evaluation metrics for content se-
lection standardly used in summarization research.
We perform our analyses on data from the 2008-
2011 Text Analysis Conference (TAC)1 organized
by the National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy (NIST). We choose these datasets because in
early evaluation initiatives, the protocol for manual
evaluation changed from year to year in search of
stable manual evaluation approaches (Over et al.,
2007). Since 2008, however, the same evaluation
protocol has been applied by NIST assessors and we
consider it to be the model that automatic metrics
need to emulate.
We start our discussion by briefly presenting the
manual procedure for comparing systems (Section
2) and how these scores should be best used to iden-
tify significant differences between systems over a
given test set (Section 3). Then, we embark on our
discussion of the accuracy of automatic evaluation
and its ability to reproduce manual scoring.
To begin our analysis, we assess the accuracy of
common variants of ROUGE on the TAC 2008-2011
datasets (Section 4.1). There are two aspects of eval-
uation that we pay special attention to:
Significant difference Ideally, all system compar-
isons should be performed using a test for sta-

tistical significance. As both manual metrics
and automatic metrics are noisy, a statistical
hypothesis test is needed to estimate the prob-
ability that the differences observed are what
would be expected if the systems are compa-
rable in their performance. When this proba-
bility is small (by convention 0.05 or less) we
reject the null hypothesis that the systems? per-
formance is comparable.
It is important to know if scoring a system via
an automatic metric will lead to conclusions
about the relative merits of two systems differ-
ent from what one would have concluded on the
basis of manual evaluation. We report very en-
couraging results, showing that automatic met-
rics rarely contradict manual metrics, and some
metrics never lead to contradictions. For com-
pleteness, given that most papers do not report
significance, we also compare the agreement
between manual and automatic metrics without
taking significance into account.
Type of comparison Established manual evalua-
tions have two highly desirable properties: (1)
they can tell apart good automatic systems from
bad automatic systems and (2) they can differ-
entiate automatic summaries from those pro-
duced by humans with high accuracy. Both
properties are essential. Obviously, choosing
the better system in development cycles is key
in eventually improving overall performance.
Being able to distinguish automatic from man-
ual summaries is a general sanity test 2 that any
evaluation adopted for wide use is expected to
pass?it is useless to report system improve-
ments when it appears that automatic methods
are as good as human performance3. As we will
see, there is no single ROUGE variant that has
both of these desirable properties.
Finally, in Section 5, we discuss ways to compare
other automatic evaluation protocols with the refer-
2For now, automatic systems do not have the performance
of humans, thus, the ability to distinguish between human and
automatically generated summaries is an exemplar of the wider
problem of distinguishing high quality summaries from others.
3Such anomalous findings, when using automatic evalua-
tion, have been reported for some summarization genres such
as summarization of meetings (Galley, 2006).
ence ROUGE metrics we have established. We de-
fine standard tests for significance that would iden-
tify evaluations that are significantly more accurate
than the current reference measures, thus warrant-
ing wider adoption for future system development
and reporting of results. As a case study we apply
these to the TAC AESOP (Automatically Evaluating
Summaries of Peers) task which called for the devel-
opment of novel evaluation techniques that are more
accurate than ROUGE evaluations.
2 Manual evaluation
Before automatic evaluation methods are developed,
it is necessary to establish a desirable manual eval-
uation which the automatic methods will need to re-
produce. The type of summarization task must also
be precisely specified?single- or multi-document
summarization, summarization of news, meetings,
academic articles, etc. Saying that an automatic
evaluation correlates highly with human judgement
in general, is disturbingly incomplete, as the same
automatic metric can predict some manual evalu-
ation scores for some summarization tasks well,
while giving poor correlation with other manual
scores for certain tasks (Lin, 2004; Liu and Liu,
2010).
In our work, we compare automatic metrics with
the manual methods used at TAC: Pyramid and Re-
sponsiveness. These manual metrics primarily aim
to assess if the content of the summary is appro-
priately chosen to include only important informa-
tion. They do not deal directly with the linguistic
quality of the summary?how grammatical are the
sentences or how well the information in the sum-
mary is organized. Subsequently, in the experiments
that we present in later sections, we do not address
the assessment of automatic evaluations of linguistic
quality (Pitler et al., 2010), but instead analyze the
performance of ROUGE and other related metrics
that aim to score summary content.
The Pyramid evaluation (Nenkova et al., 2007) re-
lies on multiple human-written gold-standard sum-
maries for the input. Annotators manually identify
shared content across the gold-standards regardless
of the specific phrasing used in each. The pyra-
mid score is based on the ?popularity? of informa-
tion in the gold-standards. Information that is shared
2
across several human gold-standards is given higher
weight when a summary is evaluated relative to the
gold-standard. Each evaluated summary is assigned
a score which indicates what fraction of the most
important information for a given summary size is
expressed in the summary, where importance is de-
termined by the overlap in content across the human
gold-standards.
The Responsiveness metric is defined for query-
focused summarization, where the user?s informa-
tion need is clearly stated in a short paragraph. In
this situation, the human assessors are presented
with the user query and a summary, and are asked
to assign a score that reflects to what extent the sum-
mary satisfies the user?s information need. There are
no human gold-standards, and the linguistic quality
of the summary is to some extent incorporated in the
score, because information that is presented in a con-
fusing manner may not be seen as relevant, while it
could be interpreted by the assessor more easily in
the presence of a human gold-standard. Given that
all standard automatic evaluation procedures com-
pare a summary with a set of human gold-standards,
it is reasonable to expect that they will be more accu-
rate in reproducing results from Pyramid evaluation
than results from Responsiveness judgements.
3 Comparing systems
Evaluation metrics are used to determine the rela-
tive quality of a summarization system in compari-
son to one or more systems, which is either another
automatic summarizer, or a human reference sum-
marizer. Any evaluation procedure assigns a score
to each summary. To identify which of the two sys-
tems is better, we could simply average the scores
of summaries produced by each system in the test
set, and compare these averages. This approach is
straightforward; however, it gives no indication of
the statistical significance of the difference between
the systems. In system development, engineers may
be willing to adopt new changes only if they lead
to significantly better performance that cannot be at-
tributed to chance.
Therefore, in order to define more precisely what
it means for a summarization system to be ?bet-
ter? than another for a given evaluation, we employ
statistical hypothesis testing comparisons of sum-
marization systems on the same set of documents.
Given an evaluation of two summarization systems
A and B we have the following:
Definition 1. We say a summarizer A ?signifi-
cantly outperforms? summarizer B for a given
evaluation score if the null hypothesis of the fol-
lowing paired test is rejected with 95% confidence.
Given two vectors of evaluation scores x and y,
sampled from the corresponding random vari-
ables X and Y, measuring the quality of sum-
marizer A and B, respectively, on the same col-
lection of document sets, with the median of x
greater than the median of y,
H0 : The median of X ? Y is 0.
Ha : The median of X ? Y is not 0.
We apply this test using human evaluation met-
rics, such as pyramid and responsiveness, as well as
automatic metrics. Thus, when comparing two sum-
marization systems we can, for example, say system
A significantly outperforms system B in responsive-
ness if the null hypothesis can be rejected. If the null
hypothesis cannot be rejected, we say system A does
not significantly perform differently than system B.
A complicating factor when the differences be-
tween systems are tested for significance, is that
some inputs are simply much harder to summarize
than others, and there is much variation in scores
that is not due to properties of the summarizers
that produced the summaries but rather properties of
the input text that are summarized (Nenkova, 2005;
Nenkova and Louis, 2008).
Given this variation in the data, the most appropri-
ate approach to assess significance in the difference
between system is to use paired rank tests such as
a paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which is equiva-
lent to the Mann-Whitney U test. In these tests, the
scores of the two systems are compared only for the
same input and ranks are used instead of the actual
difference in scores assigned by the evaluation pro-
cedures. Prior studies have shown that paired tests
for significance are indeed able to discover consid-
erably more significant differences between systems
than non-paired tests, in which the noise of input dif-
ficulty obscures the actual difference in system per-
3
formance (Rankel et al., 2011). For this paper, we
perform all testing using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.
4 How do we identify a good metric?
If we treat manual evaluation metrics as our gold
standard, then we require that a good automatic met-
ric mirrors the distinctions made by such a man-
ual metric. An automatic metric for summarization
evaluation should reliably predict how well a sum-
marization system would perform relative to other
summarizers if a human evaluation were performed
on the summaries. An automatic metric would hope
to answer the question:
Would summarizer A significantly outper-
form summarizer B when evaluated by a
human?
We address this question by evaluating how well
an automatic metric agrees with a human metric in
its judgements in the following cases:
? all comparisons between different summariza-
tion systems
? all comparisons between systems and human
summarizers.
Depending on the application, we may record the
counts of agreements and disagreements or we may
normalize these counts to estimate the probability
that an automatic evaluation metric will agree with a
human evaluation metric.
4.1 Which is the best ROUGE variant
In this section, we set out to identify which of the
most widely-used versions of ROUGE have highest
accuracy in reproducing human judgements about
the relative merits of pairs of systems. We exam-
ine ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4. For
all experiments we use stemming and for each ver-
sion we test scores produced both with and without
removing stopwords. This corresponds to six differ-
ent versions of ROUGE that we examine in detail.
ROUGE outputs several scores including preci-
sion, recall, and an F-measure. However, the most
informative score appears to be recall as reported
when ROUGE was first introduced (Lin and Hovy,
2003). Given that in the data we work with, sum-
maries are produced for a specified length in word
s (and all summaries are truncated to the predefined
length), recall on the task does not allow for artifi-
cially high scores which would result by producing
a summary of excessive length.
The goal of our analysis is to identify which of the
ROUGE variants is most accurate in correctly pre-
dicting which of two participating systems is the bet-
ter one according to the manual pyramid and respon-
siveness scores. We use the data for topic-focused
summarization from the TAC summarization track
in 2008-20114.
Table 1 gives the overview of the 2008-2011 TAC
Summarization data, including the number of top-
ics and participants. For each topic there were four
reference (model) summaries, written by one of the
eight assessors; as a result, there were eight human
?summarizers,? but each produced summaries only
for half of the topics.

Table 1: Data in TAC 2008-2011 Summarization track.
We compare each pair of participating systems
based on the manual evaluation score. For each pair,
we are interested in identifying the system that is
better. We consider both the case when an appropri-
ate test for statistical significance has been applied to
pick out the better system as well as the case where
simply the average scores of systems over the test set
are compared. The latter use of evaluations is most
common in research papers on summarization; how-
ever, in summarization system development, testing
for significance is important because a difference in
summarizer scores that is statistically significant is
much more likely to reflect a true difference in qual-
ity between the two systems.
Therefore, we look at agreement between
ROUGE and manual metrics in two ways:
? agreement about significant differences be-
tween summarizers, according to a paired

date summaries. We do not report results on this task for the
sake of simplifying the discussion.

? agreement about any differences between sum-
marizers (whether significant on not).
Agreements occur when the two evaluation met-
rics make the same distinction between System A
and System B: A is significantly better than B, A is
significantly worse than B, or A and B are not sig-
nificantly different from each other. Contradictions
occur when both metrics find a significant difference
between A and B, but in opposite directions; this is
a much more serious case than a mere lack of agree-
ment (i.e., when one metric says A and B are not
significantly different, and the other metric finds a
significant difference).
Table 2 shows the average percentage agreement
between ROUGE and Pyramid/Responsiveness
when it comes to identifying significant differences
or lack thereof. Column diff shows the recall
of significant differences between pairs of systems
(i.e., how many significant differences determined
by Pyramid/Responsiveness are found by ROUGE);
column no diff gives the recall of the cases where
there are no significant differences between two sys-
tems according to Pyramid/Responsiveness.
There are a few instances of contradictions, as
well, but their numbers are fairly small. ?Auto only?
refers to comparisons between automatic summariz-
ers only; ?Human-Automatic? refers to cases when
a human summarizer is compared to an automatic
summarizer. There are fewer human summarizers,
so there are fewer ?Human-Automatic? comparisons
than ?Auto only? ones.
There are a few exceptional cases where the hu-
man summarizer is not significantly better than the
automatic summarizers, even according to the man-
ual evaluation, which accounts for the uniform val-
ues in the ?no difference? column (this is proba-
bly because the comparison is performed for much
fewer test inputs).
Table 3 combines the number of agreements in
the ?difference? and ?no difference? columns from
Table 2 into the sig column, which shows accu-
racy: in checking system pairs for significant differ-
ences, in how many cases does ROUGE make the
same decision as the manual metric (there is/isn?t
a significant difference between A and B). Ta-
ble 3 also gives the number of agreements about
any differences between systems, not only those
that reached statistical significance; in other words,
agreements on system pairwise rankings. In both
5
tables we see that removing stopwords often de-
creases performance of ROUGE, although not al-
ways. Also, there is no clear winner in the ROUGE
comparison: while ROUGE-2 with stemming is the
best at distinguishing among automatic summariz-
ers, ROUGE-1 is the most accurate when it comes
to human?automatic comparisons. To reflect this,
we adopt both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 (with stem-
ming, without removing stopwords) as our reference
automatic metrics for further comparisons.
Reporting pairwise accuracy of automatic evalua-
tion measures has several advantages over reporting
correlations between manual and automatic metrics.
In correlation analysis, we cannot obtain any sense
of how accurate the measure is in identifying statis-
tically significant differences. In addition, pairwise
accuracy is more interpretable than correlations and
gives some provisional indication about how likely
it is that we are drawing a wrong conclusion when
relying on automatic metric to report results.
Table 3 tells us that when statistical significance
is not taken into account, in 89% of cases ROUGE-
2 scores will lead to the same conclusion about the
relative merits of systems as the expensive Pyramid
evaluation. In 83% of cases the conclusions will
agree with the Responsiveness evaluation. The accu-
racy of identifying significant differences is worse,
dropping by about 10% for both Pyramid and Re-
sponsiveness.
Finally, we would like to get empirical estimates
of the relationship between the size of the difference
in ROUGE-2 scores between two systems and the
agreement between manual and ROUGE-2 evalua-
tion. The goal is to check if it is the case that if
one system scores higher than another by x ROUGE
points, then it would be safe to assume that a manual
evaluation would have led to the same conclusion.
Figure 1 shows a histogram of differences in
ROUGE-2 scores. The pairs for which this differ-
ence was significant are given in red and for those
where the difference is not significant are given in
blue. The histogram clearly shows that in general,
the size of improvement cannot be used to replace a
test for significance. Even for small differences in
ROUGE score (up to 0.007) there are about 15 pairs
out of 200 for which the difference is in fact signif-
icant according to Pyramid or Responsiveness. As
the difference in ROUGE-2 scores between the two
systems increases, there are more significant differ-
ences. For differences greater than 0.05, all differ-
ences are significant.
Figure 2 shows the histograms of differences in
ROUGE-2 scores, split into cases where the pairwise
ranking of systems according to ROUGE agrees
with manual evaluation (blue) and disagrees (red).
For score differences smaller than 0.013, about half
of the times ROUGE-2 would be wrong in identify-
ing which system in the pair is the better one accord-
ing to manual evaluations. For larger differences the
number of disagreements drops sharply. For this
dataset, a difference in ROUGE-2 scores of more
than 0.04 always corresponds to an improvement in
the same direction according to the manual metrics.
5 Looking for better metrics
In the preceding sections, we established that
ROUGE-2 is the best ROUGE variant for compar-
ing two automatic systems, and ROUGE-1 is best in
distinguishing between humans and machines. Ob-
viously, it is of great interest to develop even bet-
ter automatic evaluations. In this section, we out-
line a simple procedure for deciding if a new au-
tomatic evaluation is significantly better than a ref-
erence measure. For this purpose, we consider the
automatic metrics from the TAC 2011 AESOP task,
which called for the development of better automatic
metrics for summarization evaluation NIST ( 2011).
For each automatic evaluation metric, we estimate
the probability that it agrees with Pyramid or Re-
sponsiveness. Figure 3 gives the estimated proba-
bility of agreement with Pyramid and Overall Re-
sponsiveness for all AESOP 2011 metrics with an
agreement of 0.6 or more. The metrics are plot-
ted with error bars giving the 95% confidence in-
tervals for the probability of agreement with the
manual evaluations. The red-dashed line is the
performance of the reference automatic evaluation,
which is ROUGE-2 for machine only and ROUGE-
1 for comparing machines and human summariz-
ers. Metrics whose 95% confidence interval is be-
low this line are significantly worse (as measured
by the z-test approximation of a binomial test) than
the baseline. Conversely, those whose 95% con-
fidence interval is above the red line are signifi-
cantly better than the baseline. Thus, just ROUGE-

BE (the MINIPAR variant of ROUGE-BE), one of
NIST?s baselines for AESOP, significantly outper-
formed ROUGE-2 for predicting pyramid compar-
isons; and 4 metrics: ROUGE-BE, DemokritosGR2,
catholicasc1, and CLASSY1, all significantly out-
perform ROUGE-2 for predictiong responsiveness
comparisons. Descriptions of these metrics as well
as the other proposed metrics can be found in the
TAC 2011 proceedings (NIST, 2011).
Similarly, Figure 4 gives the estimated probabil-
ity when the comparison is made between human
and machine summarizers. Here, 10 metrics are sig-
nificantly better than ROUGE-1 in predicting com-
parisons between automatic summarization systems
and human summarizers in both pyramid and re-
sponsiveness. The ROUGE-SU4 and ROUGE-BE
baselines are not shown here but their performance
was approximately 57% and 46% respectively.
If we limit the comparisons to only those where
a significant difference was measured by Pyramid
and also Overall Responsiveness, we get the plots
given in Figure 5 for comparing automatic summa-
rization systems. (The corresponding plot for com-
parisons between machines and humans is omitted
as all differences are significant.) The results show
that there are 6 metrics that are significantly better
than ROUGE-2 for correctly predicting when a sig-
nificant difference in pyramid scores occurs, and 3
metrics that are significantly better than ROUGE-2
for correctly predicting when a significant difference
in responsiveness occurs.
6 Discussion
In this paper we provided a thorough assessment
of automatic evaluation in summarization of news.
We specifically aimed to identify the best variant
of ROUGE on several years of TAC data and dis-
covered that ROUGE-2 recall with stemming and
stopwords not removed, provides the best agreement
with manual evaluations. The results shed positive
light on the automatic evaluation, as we find that
ROUGE-2 agrees with manual evaluation in almost
90% of the case when statistical significance is not
computed, and about 80% when it is. However,
these numbers are computed in a situation where
many very different systems are compared?some

very good, others bad. We examine the size of dif-
ference in ROUGE score and identify that for differ-
ences less than 0.013 a large fraction of the conclu-
sions drawn by automatic evaluation will contradict
the conclusion drawn by a manual evaluation. Fu-
ture studies should be more mindful of these find-
ings when reporting results.
Finally, we compare several alternative automatic
evaluation measures with the reference ROUGE
variants. We discover that many new proposals are
better than ROUGE in distinguishing human sum-
maries from machine summaries, but most are the
same or worse in evaluating systems. The Basic El-
ements evaluation (ROUGE-BE) appears to be the
strongest contender for an automatic evaluation to
augment or replace the current reference.
