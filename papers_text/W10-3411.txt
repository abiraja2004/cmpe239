Abstract
Our work is confined to word access,
that is, we present here our ideas of how to
improve electronic dictionaries in order to
help language producers (speaker/writer)
to find the word they are looking for. Our
approach is based on psychological find-
ings (representation, storage and access of
information in the human mind), observed
search strategies and typical navigational
behavior.
If one agrees with the idea that lex-
ical access (word finding) is basically a
search problem, then one may still want
to find out where and how to search.
While the space, i.e. the semantic map
in which search takes place is a resource
problem,? any of the following could be
used: dictionary, corpus, thesauraus, etc.
or a mix of them,? its exploration is typ-
ically a search problem. Important as it
may be, the building of a high quality re-
source is not the focus of this work, we
rely on an existing one, and while we
are concerned with its quality, we will be
mostly concerned here with search meth-
ods, in order to determine the best.
1 Problem: find the needle in a haystack
One of the most vexing problems in speaking or
writing is that one knows a given word, yet one
fails to access it when needed. This kind of search
failure, often referred to as dysnomia or Tip of the
Tongue-problem, occurs not only in communica-
tion, but also in other activities of everyday life.
Being basically a search problem it is likely to oc-
cur whenever we look for something that exists
in real world (objects) or our mind: dates, phone
numbers, past events, peoples? names, or you just
name it.
As one can see, we are concerned here with the
problem of words, or rather, how to find them in
the place where they are stored: the human brain,
or an external resource, a dictionary. Our work
being confined to lexical access, we would like
to develp a semantic map and a compass to help
language producers to find the word they are look-
ing for. More precisely, we try to build an index
and a navigational tool allowing people to access
words no matter how incomplete their conceptual
input may be. Our approach is based on psy-
chological findings concerning the mental lexicon
(Aitchison, 2003; Levelt et al, 1999), i.e. storage
and access of information in the human mind, ob-
served search strategies and typical navigational
behavior.
2 Consider the following elements before
attempting an engineering solution
Before conceiving a roadmap leading to an en-
gineering solution it may be useful to consider
certain points. The list here below is by no
means complete, neither is the following discus-
sion. Nevertheless we believe that the following
points are worth consideration: features of the
mental lexicon, how to build and use the resource,
searching, ranking and weights, interface prob-
lems. For reasons of space constraints we will
touch briefly only upon some of these points.
Our main goal is the enhancement of electronic
dictionaries to help speakers or writers to find
75
quickly and intuitively the word they are looking.
To achieve this target we take inspiration in the
findings concerning the human brain (structure,
process) when it tries access words in the mental
lexicon.
2.1 The mental lexicon, a small-world
network?
While forms (lemma) and meanings (lexical con-
cepts, definitions) are stored side by side in pa-
per dictionaries (holistic presentation), the hu-
man brain stores them differently. The informa-
tion concerning meaning, forms and sound is dis-
tributed across various layers. Lexical fragmen-
tation or information distribution is supported by
many empirical findings,1 and while this fact is
arguably the reason accounting for word access
problems, it is probably also the explanation of
the power and the flexibility of the human mind
which generally manages to find in no time the
right term after having searched for it in a huge
store of words.
While it is still not entirely clear what is stored,
or whether anything is stored at all 2 coming close
to the kind of information generally found in dic-
tionaries, it does seem clear though that the struc-
ture of mental lexicon is a multidimensional net-
work in which the user navigates. ?Entries in the
lexicon are not islands; the lexicon has an inter-
nal structure. Items are connected or related in
various ways...There are item relations within and
between entries.? (Levelt, 1989). While the for-
mer relate meanings and forms: syntactic (part
of speech), morphological, phonological informa-
tion, the latter connect lexical entries.3 In sum,
1Speech errors (Fromkin, 1980), studies on aphasia (Dell
et al, 1997; Blanken et al, 2004) or response times i.e.
chronometric studies (Levelt et al, 1999), neuroimaging
(Shafto et al, 2007; Kikyo et al, 2001), eye movements,
(Roelofs, 2004), experiments on priming (Schvaneveldt et
al., 1976) or the tip of the tongue problem (TOT) (Brown
and McNeill, 1996).
2An important feature of the mental lexicon lies in the
fact that the entries are not accessed but activated (Marslen-
Wilson, 1990; Altmann, 1997). Of course, such a detail can
have far reaching consequences concerning knowledge rep-
resentation and use, i.e. structure and process.
3These are typically the kind of relations we can find in
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which happens to be quite rich
in this respect, but relatively poor with regard to intrinsic, i.e.
intralexical information.
lexical networks store or encode the information
people typically have with regard to words, and
finding the needed information, amounts to enter
the graph at some point,? in the case of writing or
speaking, usually a node dedicated to meaning,?
and to follow the links until one has reached the
goal (target word). While computer scientists
call this kind of search ?navigation?, psychologists
prefer the term ?activation spreading. While not
being exactly the same, functionally speaking they
are equivalent though.
As every day language experience shows,
things may go wrong, we lack information, hence
we get blocked. Yet when trying to complete the
puzzle we do not start from scratch, we rely on
existing information, which, in terms of the net-
work metaphor means that we start from (infor-
mation underlying) a word being close to the tar-
get word.4
It is interesting to note, that our lexical graphs
seem to have similar characteristics as small-
world networks. These latter are a type of graph
in which most nodes, eventhough not being direct
neighbors, can be reached via a small number of
clicks, about 6, regardless of the starting point.
This property of networks, where objects, or the
nodes standing for them, are highly connected has
first been described by Frigyes Karinthy (1929)
a Hungarian writer, to be tested then many years
later by a social psychologist (Milgram, 1961).
Nodes can be anything, people, words, etc. If they
represent people, than edges specify their relation-
ship, i.e. the very fact that they know each other,
that they are friends, etc. Given this high connec-
tivity, anything seems to be at the distance of a few
mouse clicks. Hence, it is easy to connect peo-
ple or to find out who entertains with whom what
kind of relationship. Obviously, there is a strik-
ing similarity to our lexical graphs, and the small-
world feature has been tested by mathematicians,
who concluded that the distance for words is even
smaller than in the original Milgram experiments,
namely 4 rather than 6. Indeed, (Motter et al,
2002) and colleagues could show that more than
4As TOT experiments have shown (Brown and McNeill,
1996), people always know something concerning the target
word (meaning, form, relation to other words), hence finding
a word in such a situation amounts to puzzle-completion.
76
99 percent of the word pairs of their corpus could
be connected in 4 steps at the most.
2.2 Building the resource
There are two elements we need to get a clearer
picture of: the nature of the resource (semantic
map), and the search method i.e. the way to ex-
plore it. Concerning the resource, there are many
possible sources (dictionary, thesaurus, corpora,
or a mix of all this) and many ways of build-
ing it. Since our main goal is the building of
an index based on the notion of word relations
(triples composed of two terms and a link), the
two prime candidates are of course corpora and
association lists like the ones collected by psy-
chologists. While the former are raw data, con-
taining the information in a more or less hidden
form, the latter (often) contain the data explicitely,
but they are scarce, subject to change, and some of
the links are questionable.5
Corpora: Concerning the resource the follow-
ing points deserve consideration: size, representa-
tivity and topic sensitivity.
? Size or coverage: While size or coverage are
critical variables, they should not be overem-
phasized though, trading quantity against
quality. We need to define the meaning of
quality here, and whether, when or how lack
of quality can be (partially) compensated by
quantity. In other words, we need to define
thresholds. In the absence of clear guidelines
it is probably wise to strive for a good bal-
ance between the two, which again assumes
that we know what quality means.
? Representativity: Obviously, the system we
have in mind is only as good as the data we
use, i.e. the purity/accuracy and represen-
tativity of the word/feature-association lists.
5This flaw is due to the experimental protocol. Subjects
are asked to give the first word coming to their mind right
after a stimulas. Not having been asked to specify the link it
is the experimenter who does so. Yet, many word pairs,? say,
cat and dog,? allow for various links (love, tease, chase, etc.),
and it is not obvious at all which is the one intended by the
user. This problem could have been avoided to a large extent
if the instruction had been, ?build a sentence containing the
following word?. Another potential problem may be due to
the distance between the source and the target word: the link
may be mediated.
No single set of data (dictionary, corpus, the-
saurus) will ever suffice to capture the knowl-
edge people have. While it would be unreal-
istic to try to model the semantic map of ev-
eryone, it is not unreasonable to try to reach
an average user, say someone who has been
to school and is a computer literate. If we
want to capture the world-knowledge of this
kind of user (target), than we must beware
that it is contained in the material we use,
since our resource will be based on this data.
Hence, taking as corpus only the newspapers
read by an elite (say, Le Monde, in France),
will surely not suffice to capture the informa-
tion we need, as it will not relate information
ordinary citizens, say sport fans, are famil-
iar with or interested in. In sum, we need to
take a wide variety of sources to extract then
the needed information. While there is short-
age of some document types needed, there
are nevertheless quite a few sources one may
consider to begin with: Wikipedia, domain
taxonomies, topic signatures, (Lin and Hovy,
2000), a database like (http://openrdf.org),
etc.
? Topic sensitivity
Weights are important, but they tend to
change dynamically with time and the topic.
Think of the word ?piano? uttered in the con-
texts of a ?concert? or ?household moving?. It
is only in this latter case that this term evokes
ideas like size or weight. The dynamic re-
compution of weights as a function of topic
changes requires that the system be able to
recognize the topic changes, as otherwise it
might mislead the user by providing of in-
adequate weights. For some initial work see
(Ferret and Zock, 2006).
Association lists: Psychologists have built such
lists already decades ago (Deese, 1965; Schvan-
eveldt, 1989). Similar lists are nowadays freely
available on the web. For example, for English
there is the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus 6
and the compilation done by Nelson and his col-
leagues in Florida 7. There are also some re-
6http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/
7http://cyber.acomp.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/
77
sources for German (see 8 or 9), for Japanese,10
and probably many other languages.
While association lists are generally built man-
ually, one can also try to do so automatically or
with the help of people (see section 5 in (Zock
and Bilac, 2004)). JeuxdeMot (JdM), a collec-
tively built resource focusing on French being an
example in case.11
2.3 Searching
The goal of searching is more complex than one
might think. Of course, ultimately one should find
the object one is looking for,12 but the very pro-
cess should also be carried out quickly and natu-
rally. In addition we want to allow for recovery in
case of having taken the wrong turn, and we want
to avoid looping, that is, walking in circles, with-
out ever getting closer to the goal. Last, but not
least we want to make sure that stored informa-
tion can also be accessed.
That this is less obvious than it might seem at
first sight has been shown by (Zock and Schwab,
2008). Taking two resources (WN and Wikipedia)
that contain both a given target word, we wanted
to see whether we could access it or not. The
target word was ?vintage?. In order to find it we
provided two access keys, i.e. trigger words:
?wine? and ?harvest?. Combining the two produced
a list of 6 items in the case of WN and 45 in the
case of Wikipedia, yet, while the latter displayed
the target word, it was absent from the list pro-
duced by WN. This example illustrates the fact
that our claim concerning storage and acess is well
founded. Having stored something does by no
means guarantee its access.
In the next sections we will present a small ex-
periment concerning search.
3 System architecture
To allow for word access, we need at least two
components: an index, i.e. a resource, repre-
senting or encoding the way words are connected
8http://www.schulteimwalde.de/resource.html

10http://www.valdes.titech.ac.jp/ terry/jwad.html
11http://www.lirmm.fr/jeuxdemots/rezo.php
12This poses special requirements concerning the organi-
zation, indexing and ranking of the data, i.e. words. We will
not get into these issues here.
(database or semantic network encoding associa-
tive relations between words) and an efficient
search algorithm to find the needed information,
in our case, words.
In other words, since search requires a map or a
resource in which to search and a good algorithm
to perform the search, we are keen in finding out
how different resources (for example, Wikipedia,
WordNet or JeuxdeMots) and various search al-
gorithms might affect efficiency of word access.
While there is a link between (the quality of) the
resource and the searching, we will separate the
two, focusing here mainly on the search algo-
rithms and possible ways to evaluate them.

algorithms
4 Corpora and resources
Resources are built from corpora which can be of
various kinds: news, books, social media, ency-
clopedias, lexical databases,... They can be gen-
eral or specific, representing a particular domain.
?Text genre? may of course have an impact on
what we can expect to retrieve. Obviously, one
will not take a database of stock exchange news
if one is looking for words referring to tennis- or
fishing equipment.
To build our resource, we relied on Word-
Net (WN).13 The resource can be seen in vari-
ous ways: as a semantic network, an association
13Note, that one may consider WN (Fellbaum, 1998) not
only as a dictionary, but also as a corpus. Actually we used
precisely this kind of corpus for building our resource.
78
matrix, or as a list or database of 4-tuples com-
posed of terms, links and weights. These ele-
ments can be represented in the following way,
< X,Y,RZ ,w>, where X and Y are terms or ar-
guments of a given link, whose name expresses
the type of relationship holding between them
[RZ (synonyme, antonyme, hyperonyme, colloca-
tion,...)]. Links and terms have a certain weight w
which can be crucial for navigation and informa-
tion display (interface). Words may be grouped
into clusters,14 and the clusters as well as their el-
ements may be presented in the descending order
of the weight: frequent terms being shown on top
of the list.
Weights can be calculated in various ways: mu-
tual information, co-occurences, etc. For exam-
ple, for corpora, they can be seen as the number
of times two items co-occur in a given window
(sentence, phrase, paragraph, n words before or
after, . . . ). Unfortunately, this kind of information
is not always available in current resources. For
example, WN relates terms (or senses), but does
not assign them any particular weight. Yet, this
information is very important and might be added
via some learning method.
5 Search Algorithms
5.1 Definitions
Informally, a search algorithm is a method allow-
ing to retrieve a list of terms (candidate target
words presented in a given order) from a list of
pairs containing the cue- or trigger words and their
relations. For example figure 1 shows that the pair
(?beverage?, ako) allows the retrieval of {?coffee?
and ?moccha#2?}, two potential target words. More
formally, let?s define
f({(t1, R1), (t2, R2), . . . , (tm, Rm)})
= {(T1, w1), (T2, w2), . . . , (Tm, wm)}
(1)
where t1,t2,. . . ,tm are keys, cue- or trigger-words,
R1,R2,. . . ,Rm the type of relation, T1,T2,. . . ,Tm
candidate target-words andw1,w2,. . . ,wm, the as-
sociated weights. The curley brackets {} represent
the fact that we have an ordered set.
14All words having the same link will be stored and pre-
sented together. For example, ?cat? and ?dog? are likely to fall
in the category ?animal?, while ?hammer? and ?screwdriver?
will fall in the category ?tools?.
Indeed, the ?trigger word-relation? pairs are or-
dered, that is, they parallel the order in which
these terms were given as input at query time.
The candidate target words are ordered in terms of
confidence, ranking which may vary with respect
to a given search algorithm. In this paper, confi-
dence is based on the weights in the resource. Of
course, one could imagine other ways to define or
compute it.
Note that we can have R1 = R2, provided that
we do not have at the same time t1 = t2. For
instance, while it is possible to have {(?island?, in-
stance), (?island?, ako)}, one cannot have at the
same time {(?island?, instance), (?island?, instance)}
We present in the next sections various ways
to use the resource and various search algorithms.
In these experiments, we tried to use direct and
indirect links (mediated associations) contained in
the tuples and to establish linearly the weight as a
function of the position of the word in the list of
the trigger words.
5.2 General algorithm
In the general algorithm, we consider that our can-
didate target words are at the intersection of the
sets corresponding to the pairs of trigger words
and their relations.
f({(t1, Ra), (t2, Rb)}) =
f({(t1, Ra)} ? f({t2, Rb}))
(2)
We will now show, step by step, how f({(t, R)})
is affected by various uses (direct vs. indirect use)
and orderings. This will yield 4 kinds of search
algorithms.
5.3 The use of the tuples
To illustrate our algorithms, let us consider the fol-
lowing resource:
< ?mouse?,?rodent?,ako,3>;< ?rodent?,?animal?,ako,4>;
< ?rat?,?rodent?,ako,1>;< ?rat?,?animal?,ako,2>;
5.3.1 Direct use
In this case, we rely only on the direct links
< t,T ,R,w> of the resource Res:
f({(t, R)}) = {(T,W )|< t,T ,R,w> ? Res}
(3)
79
that is, in the case of direct use, the search algo-
rithm fed with the trigger word t and the relation-
ship R found all target words T contained in the
tuple < t,T ,R,w> of the resource Res. The com-
putation of the weight W is defined in 5.4. For
example, ?mouse?, would yield ?rodent?, while ?rat?,
would trigger ?animal? and ?rodent?.
5.3.2 Indirect use
In order to boost recall this algorithm takes also
indirect links into account.
f({(t, R)}) = {(T,W )|< t,T ,R,w> ? Res}
?
{(T,W )|< t,X ,R,w1> ? Res
and < X ,T ,R,w2> ? Res}
(4)
Hence, we consider neighbor words of the neigh-
bors of the trigger words.15 Again, for ?mouse?, we
get ?rodent? and ?animal?, while for ?rat?, we continue
to get ?animal? and ?rodent?.
5.4 Weighting
5.4.1 Basic Weighting
For f({(t1, R1)}, {(t2, R2)}, . . . , {(tn, Rn)}),
W = ?ti,T,Ri,wjwj(5)
In our example and for direct use, if our trigger
word list is {?mouse?, ?rat?} then the weight (W)
will be 4 (3 + 1) for ?rodent? and 6 (4 + 2) for
?animal?. In the case of indirect use, the weight will
be 4 (3 + 1) for ?rodent? and 10 (3 + 4 + 1 + 2) for
?animal?.
5.4.2 Weighting based on the cue-word?s
position and its relation to other words
Let us suppose that the user gave in this or-
der the following cue words ?A?, ?B?, ?C?. In this
case we assume that ?A? is more important than ?B?,
which is more important than ?C? in order to find
the target word. Following this line of reasoning,
we may consider the following cases:
For f({(t1, R1)}, {(t2, R2)}, . . . , {(tn, Rn)}),
W = ?ti,T,Ri,wj (n? i+ 1)? wj(6)
15Please note, we consider here only one intermediate
word (two links), as this is, computationally speaking, al-
ready quite expensive.
In our example of direct use, if our trigger word
list is {?mouse?, ?rat?}, W will be 7 (2? 3 + 1? 1)
for ?rodent?while W = 10 (2?4+1?2) for ?animal?.
For indirect use, W is 4 (2+1? 1) for ?rodent? and
17 (2? (3 + 4) + 1? (1 + 2)) for ?animal?.
5.5 Proposed Search Algorithms
Crossing the characteristics of weight (direct vs.
indirect) and use (direct vs. indirect), we get 4
possible search methods : direct use with basic
weighting (A1) or linear weighting (A2); and in-
direct use with basic weighting (A3) or linear
weighting (A4).
6 Evaluation
6.1 The problem of evaluation.
The classical in vivo / vitro approaches do not
seem to fit here. While the former tests the system
for a given application, the latter tests the system
independently. Given the fact that our system has
several components, we can evaluate each one of
them separately. More precisely, we can evaluate
the quality of the resource and/or the quality of
the search algorithm. We will focus here on the
search method.
6.2 Procedure
The basic idea is to provide each algorithm with
an ordered set of trigger words and to see how
many of them are generally needed in order to re-
veal the target word.
Another way to evaluate the quality of the
search mechanism is to check at each step the po-
sition of the target word in the list generated by
the algorithms (output).
6.3 Building the test corpus
Psychologists have studied the differences of
monolingual and bilingual speakers experienc-
ing the ?tip-of-the-tongue? problem (Pyers et al,
2009). Their experiments were based on 52
pictures corresponding to low-frequency names.
Starting from this list we were looking for asso-
ciated words. In order to build this list we used as
resource the results produced by ?Jeux de Mots?
(Lafourcade, 2007).16
16As mentionned by one of the reviewers, we could and
probably should have used the Edinburgh Associative The-
80
6.3.1 JeuxdeMots (JdM)
JeuxdeMots, meaning in English ?word games?
or ?playing with words?, is an attempt to build
collaboratively, i.e. via a game, a lexical re-
source. The goal is to find out which words peo-
ple typically associate with each other and to build
then the corresponding resource, that is, a lexical-
semantic network. What counts as a typical as-
sociation is established empirically. Given some
input from the system ?(term and link, let us say
?Americans? and ?elect as president?)? the user
produces the associated word ?(second term, let
us say ?Obama?),? answering this way the ques-
tion, what term x is related to y in this specific
way. Once the network is built, terms should be
accessible by entering the network at any point
(via some input) and by following the links un-
til one reaches the target word. This is at least the
theory. Unfortunately, in practice things do not
always work so well.
Actually, JdM has several flaws, especially with
respect to acces or search. The shortcomings are
probably rooted in too heavy reliance on the no-
tion of weight and in excessive filtering of the
output, i.e. premature elimination of the can-
didates presented to the user, list of elements
among which the user is meant to choose. In-
deed, JdM presents only the highest ranked candi-
date. Hence, words may never make it to the crit-
ical level to be included in the set from which the
user will choose the target word. Also, weights
do not necessarily correlate with users? interests.
This problem can be solved in interactive search,
provided that the output contains a critical mass of
candidates (possibly organized according to some
point of view), but the problem is most likely re-
main if one presents only one candidate (the high-
est ranked term), as this latter is not necessarily
the target, neither is it always a term from which
one would like to continue search.
There is also a problem with the link names,
saurus (http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/ ) as it contains
authentic word associations collected from people. This
point is well taken and we will consider this resource in the
future as its coverage is better than our current one and it also
avoids possible problems due to the translation. Though be-
ing generic, JeuxdeMots has mainly data on French, yet our
tests were run on English.
i.e. (metalanguage),17 though, to be fair, one must
admit that identifying and naming links is a very
difficult problem. Last, but not least, though more
related to the quality of the resource than to the
problem of search, there is a chance of user-bias.
Indeed, it is not entirely clear whether people re-
ally give the first association coming to their mind,
or the one fitting them best to continue the game
and win more points.
Despite these shortcomings, we will use JdM
as a resource as it exists not only for various lan-
guages, but is also quite rich, at least for French.
Unfortunately, the English version is very poor
compared to the French part.18 This is why we?ve
decided to use the French version for the test cor-
pus.
6.3.2 Building the test corpus
Starting from Pyer?s list, we translated each
term into French and inspected then JDM in order
to find the 10 most frequently connected words ac-
cording to this resource. Next, we translated these
terms into English, producing the list shown in the
appendix.
As we will see later, in our experiment we do
not have typed relations between the words. Actu-
ally we took from JDM what they call ?associated
ideas?.
Nevertheless, when building the list we did
have some problems. Some words do not have
any, only one, or simply very few associated ideas.
This is particularly true for low frequency words.
This being so, we deleted them (in our case 7)
from the list.
6.4 Description of the tool
Our tool is implemented in Java. To allow for on-
line access 19 we use Google?s Web Toolkits20.
The interface is very simple, akin to Google?s
search engine. At the top of the page the user is
invited to provide the input, i.e. the trigger words,
17The term typical association is underspecified to say the
least.
18For example, while for English JdM has by today (july
9, 2010) only 654 relations, the French part contained
1.011.632 the very same day, and 994.889 a month ago.

a checkbox allows to choose relations and at the
bottom are shown the candidate target words.
6.5 Description of the resource for the
experiment
In this experiment, we use the English version of
Wikipedia to build our resource. Due to corpus
characteristics, only one relation is used: neighbor
(ngh). We consider ?words occuring in the same
paragraph? as neighbours. After having deleted
?stop words? (articles, conjunction, . . . ) we lem-
matize ?plain words? by using DELA? 21
For example, a corpus containing the follow-
ing two sentences ?The cat eats the mouse \ The
mouse eats some cheese? would yield the follow-
ing resource :
< ?cat?,?mouse?,ngh,1>; < ?cat?,?eat?,ngh,1>;
< ?eat?,?cat?,ngh,1>; < ?eat?,?mouse?,ngh,2>;
< ?mouse?,?cat?,ngh,1>; < ?mouse?,?eat?,ngh,2>;
< ?mouse?,?cheese?,ngh,1>;< ?eat?,?cheese?,ngh,1>;
< ?cheese?,?mouse?,ngh,1>; < ?cheese?,?eat?,ngh,1>
It should be noted that in this experiment, links
are symmetrical.
< X,Y,ngh,w> ? < Y,X,ngh,w> (7)
6.6 Comparison and evaluation of results
Due to time contraints, we decided to use only a
small sample of words, 10 to be precise. Con-
cerning search we have tested two parameters: the
scope (direct vs. indirect links, i.e. associations,
A1 vs. A3) and the weight (presence or absence,
A2 vs. A4).
The results are shown in table 1, where ?means
that the algorithm did not find any solution, while
? implies that the trigger word list has been fully
exhausted without being able to produce the target
word among the top ten candidates. Indeed, in
order to be considered as a hit, the found target
word has to be among the top ten.
As one can see our algorithms with indirect
use (A3 and A4) never manages to find the tar-
get word. Actually, it does not fail totally. It is
just that the candidate term appears very late in
the list, too late to be considered. The algorithms
with direct use (A1 and A2) do find the elusive
word or produce a ?list? of zero candidates.

Table 1: Comparison of the number of steps
needed by each search algorithm to find the target
word ie. to put it in the list of the top ten. ? signals
the fact that the algorithm does not find any solu-
tion, while ? implies that eventhough the trigger
word list has been totally used, it did not manage
to come up with the target word among the top ten
candidates.

A2 118 98 273 ? ? ?
A3 256 288 254 189 114 59
A4 234 267 262 156 115 54
Table 2: Comparison of the position of the target
word at each step of the algorithm for ?microscope?
Table 2 illustrates this last point by showing the
position of the target word with respect to one of
the six trigger words.
While the target word always appears in A3-
A4, A1 and A2 never produce any results beyond
the 4th trigger word. The two experiments also
show that linear weighting has hardly any effect
on the results.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
We have started to caracterize lexical access as a
search problem. Since search requires a resource
in which to search and a good algorithm to per-
form the search, we were interested in establish-
ing how different resources ?(Wikipedia (WiP),
WordNet (WN), JeuxdeMots (JdM))? and various
search algorithms might affect efficiency of word
access. The focus here has been on the latter.
82
Next to search algorithms, we presented some
methods for evaluating them. While our results
are clearly preliminary and on a very small scale,
we believe that the questions we have raised are
of the right sort. Of course, a lot more work is
needed in order to answer our questions with more
authority.
