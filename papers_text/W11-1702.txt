Abstract 
This paper presents a lexicon model for subjec-
tivity description of Dutch verbs that offers a 
framework for the development of sentiment 
analysis and opinion mining applications based 
on a deep syntactic-semantic approach. The 
model aims to describe the detailed subjectivity 
relations that exist between the participants of 
the verbs, expressing multiple attitudes for each 
verb sense.  Validation is provided by an anno-
tation study that shows that these subtle subjec-
tivity relations are reliably identifiable by 
human annotators.  
 
1 Introduction 
This paper presents a lexicon model for the de-
scription of verbs to be used in applications like 
sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Verbs are 
considered as the core of the sentence as they name 
events or states with participants expressed by the 
other elements in the sentence. We consider the 
detailed and subtle subjectivity relations that exist 
between the different participants as part of the 
meaning of a verb that can be modelled  in a lex-
icon. 
Consider the following example: 
 
Ex. (1) ? Damilola?s killers were boasting about      
his murder... 
 
This sentence expresses a positive sentiment of the 
killers towards the fact they murdered Damilola 
and it expresses the negative attitude on behalf of 
the speaker/writer who has negative opinion of the 
the murderers of Damilola. Both attitudes are part 
of the semantic profile of the verb and should be 
modelled in a subjectivity lexicon.   
  As opinion mining and sentiment analysis appli-
cations tend to utilize more and more the composi-
tion of sentences (Moilanen (2007), Choi and 
Cardie (2008), Jia et al (2009)) and to use the val-
ue and properties of the verbs expressed by its 
dependency trees, there is a need for specialized 
lexicons where this information can be found. For 
the analysis of more complex opinionated text like 
news, political documents, and (online) debates the 
identification of the attitude holder and topic are of 
crucial importance. Applications that exploit the 
relations between the verb meaning and its argu-
ments can better determine sentiment at sentence-
level and trace emotions and opninions to their 
holders.   
  Our model seeks to combine the insights from a 
rather complex model like Framenet (Ruppenhofer 
et al (2010)) with operational models like Senti-
wordnet where simple polarity values (positive, 
negative, neutral) are applied to the entire lexicon.  
Subjectivity relations that exist between the differ-
ent participants are labeled with information con-
cerning both the identity of the attitude holder and 
the orientation (positive vs. negative) of the atti-
tude. The model accounts for the fact that verbs 
may express multiple attitudes. It includes a cate-
gorisation into semantic categories relevant to opi-
nion mining and sentiment analysis and provides 
means for the identification of the attitude holder 
and the polarity of the attitude and for the descrip-
tion of the emotions and sentiments of the different 
10
participants involved in the event. Attention is paid 
to the role of the speaker/writer of the event whose 
perspective is expressed and whose views on what 
is happening are conveyed in the text. 
  As we wish to provide a model for a lexicon that 
is operational and can be exploited by tools for 
deeper sentiment analysis and rich opinion mining, 
the model is validated by an annotation study of 
580 verb lexical units (cf. section 4). 
 
2 Related Work 
   Polarity and subjectivity lexicons are valuable 
resources for sentiment analysis and opinion min-
ing. For English, a couple of smaller and larger 
lexicons are available. 
      Widely used in sentiment analysis are auto-
matically derived or manually built polarity lexi-
cons. These lexicons are lists of words (for 
example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), 
Kamps et al (2004), Kim and Hovy (2004) or 
word senses (for example, Esuli and Sebastiani 
(2006), Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006), Su and Mar-
kert, (2008)) annotated for negative or positive 
polarity. As they attribute single polarity values 
(positive, negative, neutral) to words they are not 
able to account for more complex cases like boast 
(cf. example 1) which carry both negative and 
positive polarity dependening on who is the atti-
tude holder.  
  Strapparava and Valitutti (2004) developed 
Wordnet-Affect, an affective extension of Word-
net. It describes ?direct? affective words, i.e. words 
which denote emotions. Synsets are classified into 
categories like emotion, cognitive state, trait, be-
haviour, attitude and feeling. The resource is fur-
ther developed (Valittutti and Strapparava, 2010) 
by adding the descriptions of ?indirect? affective 
words according to a specific appraisal model of 
emotions (OCC). An indirect affective word indi-
rectly refers to emotion categories and can refer to 
different possible emotions according to the sub-
jects (actor, actee and observer) semantically con-
nected to it. For example, the word victory, if 
localized in the past, can be used for expressing 
pride (related to the actor or ?winner?), and disap-
pointment (related to the actee or ?loser?). If victo-
ry is a future event the expressed emotion is hope.  
Their model is similar to ours, as we both relate 
attitude to the participants of the event. However, 
their model focuses on a rich description of differ-
ent aspects and implications of emotions for each 
participant whereas we infer a single positive or 
negative attitude. Their model seems to focus on 
the cognitive aspects of emotion whereas we aim 
to also model the linguistic aspects by including 
specifically the attitude of the Speaker/Writer in 
our model. Moreover, our description is not at the 
level of the synset but at lexical unit level which 
enables us to differentiate gradations of the 
strength of emotions within the synsets. This 
enables us to relate the attitudes directly to the 
syntactic-semantic patterns of the lexical unit.   
  Also Framenet (Ruppenhofer et al (2010)) is 
used as a resource in opinion mining and sentiment 
analysis (Kim and Hovy (2006)). Framenet (FN) is 
an online lexical resource for English that contains 
more than 11,600 lexical units. The aim is to clas-
sify words into categories (frames) which give for 
each lexical unit the range of semantic and syntac-
tic combinatory possibilities. The semantic roles 
range from general ones like Agent, Patient and 
Theme to specific ones such as Speaker, Message 
and Addressee for Verbs of Communication. FN 
includes frames such as Communication, Judg-
ment, Opinion, Emotion_Directed and semantic 
roles such as Judge, Experiencer, Communicator 
which are highly relevant for opinion mining and 
sentiment analysis. However, subjectivity is not 
systematically and not (yet) exhaustively encoded 
in Framenet. For example, the verb gobble (eat 
hurriedly and noisily) belongs to the frame Inges-
tion (consumption of food, drink or smoke) and 
neither the frame nor the frame elements account 
for the negative connotation of gobble. Yet, we 
think that a resource like FN with rich and corpus 
based valency patterns is an ideal base/ starting 
point for subjectivity description. 
  None of these theories, models or resources is 
specifically tailored for the subjectivity description 
of verbs. Studies which focus on verbs for senti-
ment analysis, usually refer to smaller subclasssess 
like, for example, emotion verbs (Mathieu, 2005, 
Mathieu and Fellbaum, 2010) or quotation verbs 
(Chen 2005, 2007). 
 
3 Model  
The proposed model is built as an extension of an 
already existing lexical database for Dutch, i.e. 
11
Cornetto (Vossen et al 2008). Cornetto combines 
two resources with different semantic organisa-
tions: the Dutch Wordnet (DWN) which has, like 
the Princeton Wordnet, a synset organization and 
the Dutch Reference Lexicon (RBN) which is or-
ganised in form-meaning composites or lexical 
units. The description of the lexical units includes 
definitions, usage constraints, selectional restric-
tions, syntactic behaviors, illustrative contexts, etc. 
DWN and RBN are linked to each other as each 
synonym in a synset is linked to a corresponding 
lexical unit. The subjectivity information is mod-
elled as an extra layer related to the lexical units of 
Reference Lexicon thus providing a basis for the 
description of the verbs at word sense level.  
 
3.1 Semantic Classes 
For the identification of relevant semantic classes 
we adopt ? and broaden ? the definition of subjec-
tive language by Wiebe et al (2006). Subjective 
expressions are defined as words and phrases that 
are used to express private states like opinions, 
emotions, evaluations, speculations.  
Three main types are distinguished: 
 
Type I: 
Direct reference to private states (e.g. his alarm  
grew, he was boiling with anger). We include in 
this category emotion verbs (like feel, love and 
hate) and cognitive verbs (like defend, dare,realize 
etc.) ; 
 
Type II: 
Reference to speech or writing events that express 
private states (e.g. he condemns the president, they 
attack the speaker). According to our schema, this 
category  includes all speech and writing events 
and the annotation  schema points out if they are 
neutral (say, ask) or bear polarity (condemn, 
praise); 
 
Type III: 
Expressive subjective elements are expressions 
that indirectly express private states (e.g. superb, 
that doctor is a quack).  According to our annota-
tion  schema this category is not a separate one , 
but verbs senses which fall in this category are 
always also member of one of the other categories. 
For example, boast (cf. ex. 1) is both a Type II (i.e. 
speech act verb) verb and a Type III verb as it indi-
rectly expresses the negative attitude of the speak-
er/writer towards the speech event. By considering 
this category as combinational, it enables to make 
a clear distinction between Speaker/Writer subjec-
tivity and participant subjectivity. 
 
Moreover, we add a fourth category which in-
cludes verbs which implicitly refer to private 
states. If we consider the following examples: 
 
Ex. (2) the teacher used to beat the  students  
Ex. (3) C.A is arrested for public intoxication  by 
the police 
 
Neither beat nor arrest are included in one of the 
three mentioned categories as neither of them ex-
plicitly expresses a private state. However, in 
many contexts these verbs implicitly and indirectly 
refer to the private state of one of the participants. 
In ex. (2) the teacher and the students will have 
bad feelings towards each other and also in ex. (3) 
C.A. will have negative feelings about the situa-
tion. To be able to describe also these aspects of 
subjectivity we define the following additional 
category:  
 
Type IV: 
Indirect reference to a private state that is the 
source or the consequence of an event (action, state 
or process). The event is explicitly mentioned.   
 
Verb senses which are categorized as Type I, II or 
III are considered as subjective; verb senses cate-
gorized as Type IV are only subjective if one of the 
annotation categories (see below for more details) 
has a non-zero value; otherwise they are consi-
dered as objective. 
We assigned well-known semantic categories to 
each of the above mentioned Types (I, II and IV).  
Table 1 presents the resulting categories with ex-
amples for each category. The first column lists the 
potential subjectivity classes that can apply.

I(+III) ATTITUDE A cognitive action performed by one of the participants, in 
general the structural subject of the verb. The category is rele-
vant as these cognitive actions may imply attitudes between 
participants.  
defend, think, dare, ig-
nore, avoid, feign, pre-

II(+III) JUDGMENT A judgment (mostly positive or negative) that someone may 
have towards something or somebody. The verbs directly refer 
to the thinking or speech act of judgment. 
praise, admire, rebuke, 
criticize, scold, reproach, 
value, rate, estimate 
II(+III) COMM-S A speech act that denotes the transfer of a spoken or written 
message from the perspective of the sender or speaker (S) of 
the message. The sender or speaker is the structural subject of 
the verb. 
speak, say, write, grum-
ble, stammer, talk, email, 
cable, chitchat, nag, in-
form 
II(+III) COMM-R A speech act that denotes the transfer of a spoken or written 
message from the perspective of the receiver(R) of the mes-
sage. The receiver is the structural subject of the verb 
 read, hear, observe, 
record, watch, compre-
hend 
IV(+III) ACTION A physical action performed by one of the participants, in 
general the structural subject of the verb. The category is rele-
vant as in some cases participants express an attitude by per-
forming this action.    
run, ride, disappear, hit, 
strike, stagger, stumble 
IV(+III) PROCESS_STATE This is a broad and underspecified category of state and process 
verbs (non-action verbs) and may be considered as a rest cate-
gory as it includes all verbs which are not included in other 
categories.  
grow, disturb, drizzle, 
mizzle

3.2 Attitude and roles 
 
In our model, verb subjectivity is defined in terms 
of verb arguments carrying attitude towards each 
other, i.e. as experiencers holding attitudes towards 
targets or communicators expressing a judgment 
about an evaluee. The various participants or atti-
tude holders which are involved in the events ex-
pressed by the verbs all may have different 
attitudes towards the event and/or towards each 
other. We developed an annotation schema (see 
Table 2 below) which enables us to relate the atti-
tude holders, the orientation of the attitude (posi-
tive, negative or neutral) and the syntactic 
valencies of the verb to each other.  
  To be able to attribute the attitudes to the relevant 
participants we identify for each form-meaning 
unit the semantic-syntactic distribution of the ar-
guments, the associated Semantic Roles and some 
coarse grained selection restrictions. 
We make a distinction between participants 
which are part of the described situation, the so-
called event internal participants, and participants  
that are outside the described situation, the external 
participants.  
 
? Event internal attitude holders 
 
The event internal attitude holders are partici-
pants which are lexicalized by the structural sub-
ject (A1), direct object (A2 or A3) or 
indirect/prepositional object (A2 or A3). A2 and 
A3 both can be syntactically realized as an NP, a 
PP, that-clause or infinitive clause. Each partici-
pant is associated with coarse-grained selection 
restrictions: SMB (somebody +human), SMT 
(something -human) or SMB/SMT (some-
body/something + ? human).  
Attitude (positive, negative and neutral) is attri-
buted to the relations between participants A1 vs. 
A2 (A1A2) and A1 vs. A3 (A1A3) and/or the rela-
tion between the participants (A1, A2 and A3) and 
the event itself (A1EV, A2EV and A3EV, respec-
tively) as illustrated by the following examples.  
 
verdedigen  (defend: argue or speak in defense of) 
A1A2:  positive 
A1A3:  negative 
SMB (A1) SMB/SMT 
(A2) 
tegen SMB/SMT 
(A3) 
He(A1) defends his decision(A2) against 
 critique(A3) 
 
verliezen (lose: miss from one's possessions) 
A1EV: negative 
SMB(A1) SMB/SMT(A2) 
He (A1) loses his sunglasses (A2) like crazy  
 
? Event external attitude holders 
 
Event external attitude holders are participants who 
are not part of the event itself but who are outside 
observers. We distinguish two kind of perspec-
tives, i.e. that of the Speaker or Writer (SW) and a 
more general perspective (ALL) shared by a vast 
majority of people.  
 
? Speaker /Writer (SW) 
 
The Speaker/Writer (SW) expresses his attitude 
towards the described state of affairs by choosing 
words with overt affective connotation (cf. ex. 4) 
or by conveying his subjective interpretation of 
what happens (cf. ex. 5).  
 
Ex. 4: He gobbles down three hamburgers a day 
 
In (ex. 4) the SW not only describes the eating 
behavior of the ?he? but he also expresses his nega-
tive attitude towards this behavior by choosing the 
negative connotation word gobble.  
 
(Ex. 5) B. S. misleads district A voters 
 
In (ex. 5), the SW expresses his negative attitude 
towards the behavior of the subject of the sentence, 
by conceptualizing it in a negative way.  
 
? ALL 
 
Some concepts are considered as negative by a vast 
majority of people and therefore express a more 
general attitude shared by most people. For exam-
ple, to drown, will be considered negative by eve-
rybody, i.e. observers, participants to the event and 
listener to the speech event. These concepts are 
labeled with a positive or negative attitude label for 
ALL. The annotation model is illustrated in table 2.

4 Intercoder Agreement Study 
 
To explore our hypothesis that different attitudes  
associated with the different attitude holders can be 
modelled in an operational lexicon and to explore 
how far we can stretch the description of subtle 
subjectivity relations, we performed an inter-
annotator agreement study to assess the reliability 
of the annotation schema.  
We are aware of the fact that it is a rather complex 
annotation schema and that high agreement rates 
are not likely to be achieved. The main goal of the 
annotation task is to determine what extent this 
kind of subjectivity information can be reliably 
identified, which parts of the annotation schema 
are more difficult than others and perhaps need to 
be redefined. This information is especially valua-
ble when ? in future- lexical acquisition tasks will 
be carried out to acquire automatically parts of the 
information specified by the annotation schema. .  
Annotation is performed by 2 linguists (i.e. both 
authors of this paper). We did a first annotation 
task for training and discussed the problems before 
the gold standard annotation task was carried out. 
The annotation is based upon the full description of 
 
15
the lexical units including glosses and illustrative 
examples. 
4.1 Agreement results 
All attitude holder categories were annotated as 
combined categories and will be evaluated together 
and as separate categories.   
? Semantic category polarity  
   Overall percent agreement for all 7 attitude hold-
er categories is 66% with a Cohen kappa (?) of 
0.62 (cf. table 3, first row). Table 3 shows that not 
all semantic classes are of equal difficulty.

Table 4 shows that agreement rates for each sepa-
rate attitude holder differ. Although some catego-
ries are not reliable identifiable (cf. A1EV, A2EV, 
A3EV, ALL), the larger categories with many 
sentiment-laden items (cf. the third column which 
gives the coverage in percentage with regard to 
positive or negative annotations) are the ones with 
high agreement rates.

One single polarity value for each item is derived 
by collapsing all attitude holder polarity values 
into one single value. If an item is tagged with 
different polarity values we apply them in the fol-
lowing order: SW, A1A2, A1A3, A1EV, A2EV, 
A3EV, ALL. As can be seen from table 6, ob-
served agreement is 84% and kappa=0.75. Separate 
polarity computation (positive, negative and neu-
tral) ? with one polarity value of interest and the 
other values combined into one non-relevant cate-
gory - shows that all polarity values are reliable 
identifiable.

4.2 Disagreement Analysis 
 
Overall agreement is 66% (K=0.62) which is a 
reasonable score, in particular for such a compli-
cated annotation schema. Moreover, scores are 
high for semantic categories such as Communica-
tion (0.75), Judgment (0.80), Experiencer (0.74) 
which are relevant for subjectivity analysis. 
   Table 4 shows that low performance is largely 
due to the attitude holder categories A1EV, A2EV, 
A3EV and ALL which have scores ranging from 
0.37 to 0.56 whereas the categories A1A2, A1A3 
and SW are reliably identifiable. As the last 3 cate-
gories are the largest ones with respect to senti-
16
ment bearing items, overall scores do not degrade 
much.    
   The low scores of A1EV, A2EV, A3EV and 
ALL are probably due to the fact that they are easi-
ly confused with each other.  For example, jagen 
(hunt), vallen (fall), klemmen (stick, jam) and 
flauwvallen (faint) all have negative polarity but 
the annotators do not agree about who is the atti-
tude holder:  ALL (i.e. ALL have a negative atti-
tude towards hunting, falling, being jammed, and 
fainting) or A1/2-RES (i.e. the person who falls, is 
jammed, is fainted or is hunted is the one who has 
the negative attitude).  Confusion is found also 
between A2EV and A1A2. For example, with re-
spect to misleiden (mislead), annotators agree 
about a negative attitude from A1 vs. A2 , but one 
annotator marks additionally a negative attitude on 
behalf of A2 (A2EV: negative) whereas the other 
does not. 
   Especially the category ALL seems not to be 
defined well as many items are marked positive or 
negative by one annotator and neutral by the other.  
Examples of disagreements of this kind are ploe-
gen (plough), ontwateren (drain), omvertrekken 
(pull over) and achternalopen (follow, pursue).  
Both annotators regard these items as objective 
expressions but they do not agree about whether 
some general positive or negative feelings are as-
sociated to them or not.  
    Disagreement occurs also where collocational 
information may lead one annotator to see subjec-
tivity in a sense and the other not. For example, 
houden (keep - conform one?s action or practice 
to) associated with collocations like to keep ap-
pointments and to keep one?s promises is consi-
dered positive (A1A2) by one annotator and 
neutral by the other.  This seems to apply to all 
frequent  light verbs with little semantic content 
like make, do and take. 
   With respect to the category SW disagreements 
do not arise from confusions with other categories 
but from judgments which differ between neutral 
vs. non-neutral. Consider for example, tevredens-
tellen (mollify) as in I mollified her (A2) by clean-
ing my room. Both annotators agree about the 
positive attitude between A1 and A2, but they dis-
agree (SW:positive vs. SW:neutral) about whether 
the SW conveys a positive attitude towards ?I? by 
describing her behavior or not. Other examples of 
this type are ignoreren (ignore), zich verzoenen 
(make up), redden (deal with), and dwingen 
(force).  
  Overall agreement for one polarity is rather high 
with ?=0.75. (cf. table 6). The scores are compar-
ible to agreement rates of other studies where verbs 
are marked for single polarity. For example, inter-
annotator agreement between 2 annotators who 
annotated 265 verb senses of the Micro-WNop 
corpus (Cerini et al (2007)) is 0.75 (?) as well.  It 
shows that a complicated and layered annotation 
does not hamper overall agreement and may also 
produce lexicons which are appropriate to use 
within applications that use single polarity only.   
   Summarizing, we conclude that overall agree-
ment is good, especially with regard to most se-
mantic categories relevant for subjectivity analysis 
and with respect to the most important attitude 
holder categories, SW and A1A2.  When defining 
an operational model the small and low scoring  
categories, i.e. A1/A2/A3EV and ALL, will be 
collapsed into one underspecified attitude holder 
category.  
5 Conclusions 
  In this paper we presented a lexicon model for the 
description of verbs to be used in applications like 
deeper sentiment analysis and opinion mining, 
describing the detailed and subtle subjectivity rela-
tions that exist between the different participants of 
a verb. The relations can be labeled with subjectiv-
ity information concerning the identity of the atti-
tude holder, the orientation (positive vs. negative) 
of the attitude and its target. Special attention is 
paid to the role of the speaker/writer of the event 
whose perspective is expressed and whose views 
on what is happening are conveyed in the text. 
  We measured the reliability of the annotation. 
The results show that when using all 7 attitude 
holder categories, 3 categories, SW, A1A2 and 
A1A3 are reliable and the other 4 are not. As these 
not reliable categories are also small, we think that 
the annotation schema is sufficiently validated. 
  An additional outcome to our study is that we 
created a gold standard of 580 verb senses. In the 
future we will use this gold standard  to test me-
thods for the automatic detection of subjectivity 
and polarity properties of word senses in order to 
build a rich subjectivity lexicon for Dutch verbs.
