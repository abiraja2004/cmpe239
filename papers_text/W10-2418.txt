Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel ap-
proach for Hindi Named Entity Identifica-
tion (NEI) in a large corpus. The key idea
is to harness the global distributional char-
acteristics of the words in the corpus. We
show that combining the global distribu-
tional characteristics along with the local
context information improves the NEI per-
formance over statistical baseline systems
that employ only local context. The im-
provement is very significant (about 10%)
in scenarios where the test and train cor-
pus belong to different genres. We also
propose a novel measure for NEI based
on term informativeness and show that it
is competitive with the best measure and
better than other well known information
measures.
1 Introduction
NER is the task of identifying and classifying
words in a document into predefined classes like
person, location, organization, etc. It has many ap-
plications in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NER can be divided into two sub-tasks, Named
Entity Identification (NEI) and Named Entity
Classification (NEC). In this paper, we focus on
the first step, i.e., Named Entity Identification.
NEI is useful in applications where a list of Named
Entities (NEs) is required. Machine Translation
needs identification of named entities, so that they
can be transliterated.
For Indian languages, it is tough to identify
named entities because of the lack of capitaliza-
tion. Many approaches based on MEMM (Saha et
al., 2008b), CRFs (Li and McCallum, 2003) and
hybrid models have been tried for Hindi Named
Entity Recognition. These approaches use only
the local context for tagging the text. Many ap-
plications need entity identification in large cor-
pora. When such a large corpus is to be tagged,
one can use the global distributional characteris-
tics of the words to identify the named entities.
The state-of-the-art methods do not take advantage
of these characteristics. Also, the performance
of these systems degrades when the training and
test corpus are from different domain or different
genre. We present here our approach-Combined
Local and Global Information for Named Entity
Identification (CLGIN) which combines the global
characteristics with the local context for Hindi
Named Entity Identification. The approach com-
prises of two steps: (i) Named Entity Identifica-
tion using Global Information (NGI) which uses
the global distributional characteristics along with
the language cues to identify NEs and (ii) Com-
bining the tagging from step 1 with the MEMM
based statistical system. We consider the MEMM
based statistical system (S-MEMM) as the Base-
line. Results show that the CLGIN approach out-
performs the baseline S-MEMM system by a mar-
gin of about 10% when the training and test corpus
belong to different genre and by a margin of about
2% when both, training and test corpus are similar.
NGI also outperforms the baseline, in the former
case, when training and test corpus are from dif-
ferent genre. Our contributions in this paper are:
? Developing an approach of harnessing the
global characteristics of the corpus for Hindi
Named Entity Identification using informa-
tion measures, distributional similarity, lex-
icon, term co-occurrence and language cues
? Demonstrating that combining the global
characteristics with the local contexts im-
proves the accuracy; and with a very signif-
icant amount when the train and test corpus
are not from same domain or similar genre
? Demonstrating that the system using only the
116
global characteristics is also quite compara-
ble with the existing systems and performs
better than them, when train and test corpus
are unrelated
? Introducing a new scoring function, which
is quite competitive with the best measure
and better than other well known information
measures

Table 1: Summary of Approaches
2 Related Work
There is a plethora of work on NER for En-
glish ranging from supervised approaches like
HMMs(Bikel et al, 1999), Maximum Entropy
(Borthwick, 1999) (Borthwick et al, 1998), CRF
(Lafferty et al, 2001) and SVMs to unsupervised
(Alfonseca and Manandhar, 2002), (Volker, 2005)
and semi-supervised approaches (Li and Mccal-
lum, 2005). However, these approaches do not
perform well for Indian languages mainly due to
lack of capitalization and unavailability of good
gazetteer lists. The best F Score reported for Hindi
NER using these approaches on a standard cor-
pus (IJCNLP) is 65.13% ((Saha et al, 2008a)).
Higher accuracies have been reported (81%) (Saha
et al, 2008b), albeit, on a non-standard corpus us-
ing rules and comprehensive gazetteers.
Current state-of-the-art systems (Li and McCal-
lum, 2003) (Saha et al, 2008b) use various lan-
guage independent and language specific features,
like, context word information, POS tags, suffix
and prefix information, gazetteer lists, common
preceding and following words, etc. The perfor-
mance of these systems is significantly hampered
when the test corpus is not similar to the training
corpus. Few studies (Guo et al, 2009), (Poibeau
and Kosseim, 2001) have been performed towards
genre/domain adaptation. But this still remains an
open area. Moreover, no work has been done to-
wards this for Indian languages.

One shortcoming of current approaches is that
they do not leverage on global distributional char-
acteristics of words (e.g., Information Content,
Term Co-occurrence statistics, etc.) when a large
corpus needs NEI. Rennie and Jaakkola (2005)
introduced a new information measure and used
it for NE detection. They used this approach
only on uncapitalized and ungrammatical English
text, like blogs where spellings and POS tags are
not correct. Some semi-supervised approaches
(Collins and Singer, 1999), (Riloff and Jones,
1999), (Pas?ca, 2007) have also used large available
corpora to generate context patterns for named en-
tities or for generating gazetteer lists and entity
expansion using seed entities. Klementiev and
Roth (2006) use cooccurrence of sets of terms
within documents to boost the certainty (in a
cross-lingual setting) that the terms in question
were really transliterations of each other.
In this paper, we contend that using such global
distributional characteristics improves the perfor-
mance of Hindi NEI when applied to a large cor-
pus. Further, we show that the performance of
such systems which use global distribution charac-
teristics is better than current state-of-the-art sys-
tems when the training and test corpus are not sim-
ilar (different domain/genre) thereby being more
suitable for domain adaptation.
3 MEMM based Statistical System
(S-MEMM)
We implemented the Maximum Entropy Markov
Model based system(Saha et al, 2008b) for NE
Identification. We use this system as our Base-
line and compare our approaches NGI and CLGIN
with this baseline. We used various language de-
pendent and independent features. An important

Figure 2: An Example explaining the NGI approach
modification was the use of lexicon along with tra-
ditionally used gazetteers. Gazetteers just improve
the recall whereas including the lexicon improves
the precision. The state-of-art Hindi NER sys-
tems do not use lexicon of general words but we
found that using lexicons significantly improves
the performance. Unlike English, NEs in Hindi are
not capitalized and hence it becomes important to
know, if a word is a common word or not.
Features used in S-MEMM were:
? Context Words: Preceding and succeeding two
words of the current word
? Word suffix and prefix: Fixed length (size: 2)
suffix information was used. Besides, suffix
list of common location suffixes was created
? First word and last word information
? Previous NE Tag information
? Digit information
? Gazetteer Lists: Person and Location names,
Frequent words after and before person, orga-
nization and location names, list of common
initials, stopwords, etc.
? POS Tag Information
? Lexicons: If the stemmed word was present in
the lexicon, this feature was true.
4 Our Approach-CLGIN
In this section, we describe our approach, CLGIN
in detail. It combines the global information from
the corpus with the local context. Figure 1 gives
the block diagram of the system while tagging a
corpus and Figure 2 explains the approach using
an example. This approach involves two steps.
Step 1 of CLGIN is NGI which creates a list
of probable NEs (both uni-word and multi-word)
from the given corpus and uses it to tag the whole
corpus. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 explain this step in
detail. Later, in step 2, it combines the tagging
obtained from step 1, as a feature in the MEMM
based statistical system. Output thus obtained
from the MEMM system is the final output of the
CLGIN approach. The creation of list in step 1,
involves the following steps
? A list of all words which appeared as a noun at
least once in the the corpus is extracted.
? List is ordered on the basis of the information
content derived using the whole corpus. Words
above the threshold (set during training using
the development set) are selected as NEs.
? Heuristics are applied for pruning and aug-
menting the list.
? Multi-word NEs derived using term co-
occurrence statistics along with language char-
acteristics are added to the NE list.
The above process generates a list of NEs (uni-
word and multi-word). In the second step, we pro-
vide this tagging to the S-MEMM along with other
set of features described in Section 3
During training, the cutoff threshold is set for
selecting NEs (in bullet 2) above. Also the tagging
obtained from the step 1 is added as a feature to
118
S-MEMM and a model is trained during the train-
ing phase. The following sections describe this ap-
proach in detail.
4.1 Information Measures/Scoring Functions
Various measures have been introduced for de-
termining the information content of the words.
These include, IDF (Inverse Document Fre-
quency) (Jones, 1972) , Residual IDF (Church and
Gale, 1995), xI - measure (Bookstein and Swan-
son, 1974), Gain (Papineni, 2001), etc. We intro-
duced our own information measure, RF (Ratio of
Frequencies).
4.1.1 RF (Ratio of Frequencies)
NEs are highly relevant words in a document
(Clifton et al, 2002) and are expected to have high
information content (Rennie and Jaakkola, 2005).
It has been found that words that appear frequently
in a set of documents and not so frequently in the
rest of the documents are important with respect to
that set of documents where they are frequent.
We expected the NEs to be concentrated in few
documents. We defined a new criteria which mea-
sures the ratio of the total number of times the
word appears in the corpus to the number of doc-
uments containing a word.
RF (w) = cf(w)df(w)
where cf(w) is the total frequency of a word in
the whole corpus and df(w) is the document fre-
quency. This measure is different from the TF-IDF
measure in terms of the term frequency. TF-IDF
considers the frequency of the word in the docu-
ment. RF considers it over the whole corpus.
We use the scoring function (information mea-
sure) to score all the words. During training, we
fix a threshold using the development set. Dur-
ing testing, we pick words above the threshold as
NEs. We then apply heuristics to augment this list
as well as to exclude terms from the generated list.
4.2 Heuristics for Pruning and Augmenting
NE List
Distributional Similarity: The underlying idea
of Distributional Similarity is that a word is char-
acterized by the company it keeps (Firth, 1957).
Two words are said to be distributionally similar
if they appear in similar contexts. From the previ-
ous step (Sect. 4.1), we get a list of words having
high score. Say, top t, words were selected. In
this step, we take t more words and then cluster
together these words. The purpose at this phase is
primarily to remove the false positives and to in-
troduce more words which are expected to be NEs.
For each distinct word, w in the corpus, we cre-
ate a vector of the size of the number of distinct
words in the corpus. Each term in the vector rep-
resents the frequency with which it appears in the
context (context window: size 3) of word, w. It
was observed that the NEs were clustered in some
clusters and general words in other clusters. We
tag a cluster as a NE cluster if most of the words
in the cluster are good words. We define a word
as good if it has high information content. If the
sum of the ranks of 50% of the top ranked word is
low, we tag the cluster as NE and add the words
in that set as NEs. Also, if most of the words in
the cluster have higher rank i.e. lower information
content, we remove it from the NE set.
This heuristic is used for both augmenting the
list as well to exclude terms from the list.
Lexicon: We used this as a list for excluding
terms. Terms present in the lexicon have a high
chance of not being NEs. When used alone, the
lexicon is not very effective (explained in Sec-
tion 5.2). But, when used with other approaches,
it helps in improving the precision of the sys-
tem significantly. State-of-art Hindi NER systems
use lists of gazetteers for Person names, location
names, organization names, etc. (Sangal et al,
2008), but lexicon of general words has not been
used. Unlike English, for Indian languages, it is
important to know, if a word is a general word
or not. Lexicons as opposed to gazetteers are
generic and can be applied to any domain. Un-
like gazetteers, the words would be quite common
and would appear in any text irrespective of the
domain.
Suffixes: NEs in Hindi are open class words and
appear as free morphemes. Unlike nouns, NEs,
usually do not take any suffixes (attached to them).
However, there are few exceptions like, lAl Ekl
k bAhr (laal kile ke baahar, (outside Red Fort))
or when NEs are used as common nouns, df ko
gA\EDyo\ kF j!rta h{ (desh ko gandhiyon ki za-
roorat hai, The country needs Gandhis.) etc. We
remove words appearing with common suffixes
like e\ (ein), ao\ (on), y\g (yenge), etc. from the
NE list.
Term Co-occurrence: We use the term co-
occurrence statistics to detect multi-word NEs. A
word may be a NE in some context but not in an-
other. E.g. mhA(mA (mahatma ?saint?) when ap-
119
pearing with gA\DF (Gandhi ?Gandhi?) is a NE,
but may not be, otherwise. To identify such multi-
words NEs, we use this heuristic. Such words can
be identified using Term Co-occurrence. We use
the given set of documents to find all word pairs.
We then calculate Pointwise Mutual Information
(PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) for each of these
word pairs and order the pairs in descending order
of their PMI values. Most of the word pairs belong
to the following categories:
? Adjective Noun combination (Adjectives fol-
lowed by noun): This was the most frequent
combination. E.g. BFnF g\D (bheeni gandh
?sweet smell?)
? Noun Verb combination: Edl DwknA (dil
dhadakna, ?heart beating?)
? Adverb verb combination: EKlEKlAkr
h\snA (khilkhilakar hansna, ?merrily laugh?)
? Cardinal/Ordinal Noun Combination: TowF
dr (thodi der, ?some time?)
? Named Entities
? Hindi Idioms: uSl sFDA (ullu seedha)
? Noun Noun Combination: HyAtaF aEjta (khy-
ati arjit, ?earn fame?)
? Hindi Multiwords: jof Krof (josh kharosh)
We need to extract NEs from these word pairs. The
first four combinations can be easily excluded be-
cause of the presence of a verb, cardinals and ad-
jectives. Sometimes both words in the NEs appear
as nouns. So, we cannot reject the Noun Noun
combination. We handle rest of the cases by look-
ing at the neighbours (context) of the word pairs.
We noticed three important things here:
? Multiwords which are followed (alteast once)
by m\ (mein), s (se), n (ne), k (ke), ko
(ko) (Hindi Case Markers) are usually NEs.
We did not include kF (ki) in the list be-
cause many words in the noun-noun combi-
nation are frequently followed by ki in the
sense of EkyA/ krnA (kiya/karna, ?do/did?)
e.g. HyAtaF aEjta kF (khyati arjit ki, ?earned
fame?), prF"A u?FZ kF (pariksha uttirand
ki, ?cleared the exam?), etc.
? There were word pairs which were followed
by a single word most of the time. E.g I-V
i\EXyA (East India, ?East India?) was followed
by k\pnF (Company, ?Company?) in almost all
the cases. When Company appears alone, it
may not be a NE, but when it appears with East

India, it appears as a NE. Other examples of
such word pairs were: KA iNn (Khan Ibnu,
?Khan Ibnu?) followed by alFsm (Alisam,
?Alisam?)
? There were word pairs which were followed
by uncommon words were not common words
but were different words each time, it ap-
peared. i.e. Most of the words following the
word pair were not part of lexicon. gvnr
jnrl (governor general, ?Governor Gen-
eral?) followed by [ dlhOsF, bhd  r, solbrF,
m{VkA', lOX ((dalhousie, bahadur, solbari,
metkaf, lord), ?Dalhousie, Bahadur, Solbari,
Metkaf, Lord?)] Such words are multi word
NEs.
4.3 Step 2: Combining NGI with S-MEMM
The tagging obtained as the result of the step 1
(NGI), is given as input to the MEMM based sta-
tistical system (S-MEMM). This feature is intro-
duced as a binary feature OldTag=NE. If a word is
tagged as NE in the previous step, this feature is
turned on, otherwise OldTag=O is turned on.
5 Experiments and Results
We have used Gyaan Nidhi Corpus for eval-
uation which is a collection of various books
in Hindi. It contains about 75000 documents.
The details of the corpus are given in Table
2. Names of persons, locations, organizations,
books, plays, etc. were tagged as NE and other
general words were tagged as O (others). The
tagged documents are publicly made available at
http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/ner.tar.gz.
We use the following metrics for evaluation:
Precision, Recall and F-Score. Precision is the
ratio of the number of words correctly tagged as
NEs to the total number of words tagged as NEs.
Recall is the ratio of the number of words cor-
rectly tagged as NEs to the total number of NEs
present in the data set. F Score is defined as
(F = 2 ? P ?R/(P + R))

5.1 Comparison of Information Measures
We compare the performance of the various
term informativeness measures for NEI which are
Residual IDF1, IDF 2, Gain3 and x? measure 4
and the measure defined in Section 4.1.1. Table
3 shows the results averaged after five-fold cross
validation. The graphs in the Figure 3 to Figure
7 show the distribution of words (nouns) over the
range of values of each information measure.

5.2 NGI and CLGIN Approaches (Training

Table 4 compares the results of S-MEMM, NGI
approach and CLGIN. Besides, it also shows the
step wise improvement of NGI approach. The
final F-Score achieved using NGI approach was
68%. The F-Score of the Baseline system im-
plemented using the MaxEnt package1 from the
OpenNLP community was 81.2%.
Using the lexicon alone gives an F-Score of
only 11% (Precision: 5.97 Recall: 59.7 F-Score:

performance of the overall system improves sig-
nificantly to about 57%. Note that, the use of lexi-
con resulted in an increase in precision (0.5860)
which was accompanied by improvement in re-
call (0.5693) also. The cutoff thresholds in both
cases (Rows 2 and 4 of Table 4) were different.
Suffix information improved the systems perfor-
mance to 65%. As words were removed, more
words from the initial ordered list (ordered on the
basis of score/information content) were added.
Hence, there was a small improvement in recall,
too. Improvement by distributional similarity was
eclipsed after the pruning by lexicon and suffix in-
formation. But, in the absence of lexicon; distri-
butional similarity and suffix information can be
used as the pruning heuristics. Adding the multi-
word NEs to the list as explained in the section 4.2
using term co-occurrence statistics, improved the
accuracy significantly by 3%. Word pairs were ar-
ranged in the decreasing order of their PMI values
and a list was created. We found that 50% of the
NE word pairs in the whole tagged corpus lied in
the top 1% of this word pairs list and about 70%
of NE word pairs were covered in just top 2% of
the list.
CLGIN which combines the global informa-
tion obtained through NGI with the Baseline S-
MEMM system gives an improvement of about
2%. After including this feature, the F-Score in-
creased to 82.8%.

were divided into (Story and Biography) and (Es-
say and History) (The proportions of train and test
sets in this division were uneven). The F Score
of NGI system was 0.6576 and S-MEMM was
0.4766. The F Score of the combined system
(CLGIN) was 0.6524.
6 Discussion and Error Analysis
6.1 RF and other information measures
As can be seen from the graphs in Figures 3 to 7,
Residual IDF best separates the NEs from the gen-
eral words. The measure introduced by us, Ratio
of Frequencies is also a good measure, although
not as good as Residual IDF but performs better
than other measures. The words having RF value
greater than 2.5 can be picked up as NEs, giving a
high recall and precision. It is evident that IDF is
better than both, Gain and xI measure, as most of
the general words have low IDF and NEs lie in the
high IDF zone. But, the general words and NEs
are not very clearly separated. As the number of
nouns is about 7-8 times the number of NEs, the
122
words having high IDF cannot be picked up. This
would result in a low precision, as a large num-
ber of non-NEs would get mixed with the general
words. Gain and xI measure do not demarcate the
NEs from the general words clearly. We observed
that they are not good scoring functions for NEs.
Information Gain doesn?t consider the fre-
quency of the terms within the document itself. It
only takes into account the document frequency
for each word. xI measure considers the fre-
quency within document but it is highly biased
towards high frequency words and hence doesn?t
perform well. Hence, common words like smy
(samay, ?time?), Gr (ghar, ?home?), etc. have
higher scores compared to NEs like BArta(bharat,
?India?), klk?A (kalkatta, ?Calcutta?), etc. Our
measure on the other hand, overcomes this draw-
back, by considering the ratio. We could have
combined the measures, instead of using only the
best measure ?Residual IDF?, but the performance
of ?Gain?, ?IDF? and ?x?-measure? was not good.
Also, results of ?RF? and ?Residual IDF? were
quite similar. Hence, we did not see any gain in
combining the measures.
6.2 S-MEMM, NGI and CLGIN
The results in Section 5 show that adding the
global information with the local context helps im-
prove the tagging accuracy especially when the
train and test data are from different genre. Sev-
eral times, the local context is not sufficient to
determine the word as a NE. For example, when
the NEs are not followed by post positions or
case markers, it becomes difficult for S-MEMM to
identify NEs, e.g., V{gor ek apvAd h{\, (tagore ek
apvaad hain,?Tagore is an exception?) or when the
NEs are separated by commas, e.g. s  k  mArF d?,
c  ?FlAl.. (Sukumari Dutt, Chunnilal ... ?Suku-
mari Dutt, Chunnilal ..?). In such cases, because
of the frequency statistics, the NGI approach is
able to detect the words V{gor (Tagore, ?Tagore?),
d? (Dutt, ?Dutt?), etc. as NEs and frequently the
CLGIN approach is able to detect such words as
NEs.
The false positives in NEIG are words which
are not present in the lexicon (uncommon words,
words absent due to spelling variations e.g.
sA\p/sA p (sanp ?snake?)) but have high informa-
tiveness. Using the context words of these words
is a possible way of eliminating these false pos-
itives. Many of the organization names having
common words (m\Xl (mandal, ?board?)) and
person names (like ?kAf (prakash,?light?)) are
present in the lexicon are not tagged by NEIG.
Some errors were introduced because of the re-
moval of morphed words. NEs like g  SbAno\, Vop
(Gulbano, Tope) were excluded.
Many of the errors using CLGIN are because of
the presence of the words in the lexicon. This ef-
fect also gets passed on to the neighbouring words.
But, the precision of CLGIN is significantly high
compared to NGI because CLGIN uses context, as
well.
The statistical system (S-MEMM) provides the
context and the global system(NGI) provides a
strong indication that the word is a NE and the
performance of the combined approach(CLGIN)
improves significantly.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented an novel approach for Hindi NEI
which combines the global distributional charac-
teristics with local context. Results show that the
proposed approach improves performance of NEI
significantly, especially, when the train and test
corpus belong to different genres. We also pro-
posed a new measure for NEI which is based on
term informativeness. The proposed measure per-
forms quite competitively with the best known in-
formation measure in literature.
Future direction of the work will be to study
the distributional characteristics of individual tags
and move towards classification of identified enti-
ties. We also plan to extend the above approach
to other Indian languages and other domains. We
also expect further improvements in accuracy by
replacing the MEMM model by CRF. Currently,
we use a tagged corpus as development set to tune
the cut-off threshold in NGI. To overcome this de-
pendence and to make the approach unsupervised,
a way out can be to find an approximation to the
ratio of the number of nouns which are NEs to the
number of nouns and then use this to decide the
cut-off threshold.
