Abstract
We propose several improvements to the
hierarchical phrase-based MT model of
Chiang (2005) and its syntax-based exten-
sion by Zollmann and Venugopal (2006).
We add a source-span variance model
that, for each rule utilized in a prob-
abilistic synchronous context-free gram-
mar (PSCFG) derivation, gives a confi-
dence estimate in the rule based on the
number of source words spanned by the
rule and its substituted child rules, with
the distributions of these source span sizes
estimated during training time.
We further propose different methods of
combining hierarchical and syntax-based
PSCFG models, by merging the grammars
as well as by interpolating the translation
models.
Finally, we compare syntax-augmented
MT, which extracts rules based on target-
side syntax, to a corresponding variant
based on source-side syntax, and experi-
ment with a model extension that jointly
takes source and target syntax into ac-
count.
1 Introduction
The Probabilistic Synchronous Context Free
Grammar (PSCFG) formalism suggests an intu-
itive approach to model the long-distance and lex-
ically sensitive reordering phenomena that often
occur across language pairs considered for statis-
tical machine translation. As in monolingual pars-
ing, nonterminal symbols in translation rules are
used to generalize beyond purely lexical opera-
tions. Labels on these nonterminal symbols are
often used to enforce syntactic constraints in the
generation of bilingual sentences and imply con-
ditional independence assumptions in the statis-
tical translation model. Several techniques have
been recently proposed to automatically iden-
tify and estimate parameters for PSCFGs (or re-
lated synchronous grammars) from parallel cor-
pora (Galley et al, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Zollmann
and Venugopal, 2006; Liu et al, 2006; Marcu et
al., 2006).
In this work, we propose several improvements
to the hierarchical phrase-based MT model of
Chiang (2005) and its syntax-based extension by
Zollmann and Venugopal (2006). We add a source
span variance model that, for each rule utilized
in a probabilistic synchronous context-free gram-
mar (PSCFG) derivation, gives a confidence es-
timate in the rule based on the number of source
words spanned by the rule and its substituted child
rules, with the distributions of these source span
sizes estimated during training (i.e., rule extrac-
tion) time.
We further propose different methods of com-
bining hierarchical and syntax-based PSCFG
models, by merging the grammars as well as by
interpolating the translation models.
Finally, we compare syntax-augmented MT,
which extracts rules based on target-side syntax,
to a corresponding variant based on source-side
syntax, and experiment with a model extension
based on source and target syntax.
We evaluate the different models on the
NIST large resource Chinese-to-English transla-
tion task.

2 Related work
Chiang et al (2008) introduce structural dis-
tortion features into a hierarchical phrase-based
model, aimed at modeling nonterminal reordering
given source span length, by estimating for each
possible source span length ` a Bernoulli distribu-
tion p(R|`) where R takes value one if reorder-
ing takes place and zero otherwise. Maximum-
likelihood estimation of the distribution amounts
to simply counting the relative frequency of non-
terminal reorderings over all extracted rule in-
stances that incurred a substitution of span length
`. In a more fine-grained approach they add a sep-
arate binary feature ?R, `? for each combination of
reordering truth value R and span length ` (where
all ` ? 10 are merged into a single value), and
then tune the feature weights discriminatively on a
development set. Our approach differs from Chi-
ang et al (2008) in that we estimate one source
span length distribution for each substitution site
of each grammar rule, resulting in unique distri-
butions for each rule, estimated from all instances
of the rule in the training data. This enables our
model to condition reordering range on the in-
dividual rules used in a derivation, and even al-
lows to distinguish between two rules r1 and r2
that both reorder arguments with identical mean
span lengths `, but where the span lengths encoun-
tered in extracted instances of r1 are all close to `,
whereas span length instances for r2 vary widely.
Chen and Eisele (2010) propose a hypbrid ap-
proach between hierarchical phrase based MT
and a rule based MT system, reporting improve-
ment over each individual model on an English-
to-German translation task. Essentially, the rule
based system is converted to a single-nonterminal
PSCFG, and hence can be combined with the
hierarchical model, another single-nonterminal
PSCFG, by taking the union of the rule sets
and augmenting the feature vectors, adding zero-
values for rules that only exist in one of the two
grammars. We face the challenge of combining
the single-nonterminal hierarchical grammar with
a multi-nonterminal syntax-augmented grammar.
Thus one hierarchical rule typically corresponds
to many syntax-augmented rules. The SAMT sys-
tem used by Zollmann et al (2008) adds hierar-
chical rules separately to the syntax-augmented
grammar, resulting in a backbone grammar of
well-estimated hierarchical rules supporting the
sparser syntactic rules. They allow the model
preference between hierarchical and syntax rules
to be learned from development data by adding
an indicator feature to all rules, which is one
for hierarchical rules and zero for syntax rules.
However, no empirical comparison is given be-
tween the purely syntax-augmented and the hy-
brid grammar. We aim to fill this gap by experi-
menting with both models, and further refine the
hybrid approach by adding interpolated probabil-
ity models to the syntax rules.
Chiang (2010) augments a hierarchical phrase-
based MT model with binary syntax features rep-
resenting the source and target syntactic con-
stituents of a given rule?s instantiations during
training, thus taking source and target syntax
into account while avoiding the data-sparseness
and decoding-complexity problems of multi-
nonterminal PSCFG models. In our approach, the
source- and target-side syntax directly determines
the grammar, resulting in a nonterminal set de-
rived from the labels underlying the source- and
target-language treebanks.
3 PSCFG-based translation
Given a source language sentence f , statistical
machine translation defines the translation task as
selecting the most likely target translation e under
a model P (e|f), i.e.:
e?(f) = argmax
e
P (e|f) = argmax
e
m?
i=1
hi(e, f)?i
where the argmax operation denotes a search
through a structured space of translation outputs
in the target language, hi(e, f) are bilingual fea-
tures of e and f and monolingual features of
e, and weights ?i are typically trained discrim-
inatively to maximize translation quality (based
on automatic metrics) on held out data, e.g., us-
ing minimum-error-rate training (MERT) (Och,
2003).
In PSCFG-based systems, the search space is
structured by automatically extracted rules that
model both translation and re-ordering operations.
111
Most large scale systems approximate the search
above by simply searching for the most likely
derivation of rules, rather than searching for the
most likely translated output. There are efficient
algorithms to perform this search (Kasami, 1965;
Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) that have been ex-
tended to efficiently integrate n-gram language
model features (Chiang, 2007; Venugopal et al,
2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007; Zollmann et al,
2008; Petrov et al, 2008).
In this work we experiment with PSCFGs
that have been automatically learned from word-
aligned parallel corpora. PSCFGs are defined by a
source terminal set (source vocabulary) TS , a tar-
get terminal set (target vocabulary) TT , a shared
nonterminal set N and rules of the form: X ?
??, ?,w? where
? X ? N is a labeled nonterminal referred to as
the left-hand-side of the rule.
? ? ? (N ? TS)? is the source side of the rule.
? ? ? (N ? TT )? is the target side of the rule.
? w ? [0,?) is a non-negative real-valued
weight assigned to the rule; in our model, w is
the exponential function of the inner product of
features h and weights ?.
3.1 Hierarchical phrase-based MT
Building upon the success of phrase-based meth-
ods, Chiang (2005) presents a PSCFG model of
translation that uses the bilingual phrase pairs
of phrase-based MT as starting point to learn
hierarchical rules. For each training sentence
pair?s set of extracted phrase pairs, the set of in-
duced PSCFG rules can be generated as follows:
First, each phrase pair is assigned a generic X-
nonterminal as left-hand-side, making it an initial
rule. We can now recursively generalize each al-
ready obtained rule (initial or including nontermi-
nals)
N ? f1 . . . fm/e1 . . . en
for which there is an initial rule
M ? fi . . . fu/ej . . . ev
where 1 ? i < u ? m and 1 ? j < v ? n, to
obtain a new rule
N ? f i?11 Xkfmu+1/ej?11 Xkenv+1
where e.g. f i?11 is short-hand for f1 . . . fi?1, and
where k is an index for the nonterminal X that
indicates the one-to-one correspondence between
the new X tokens on the two sides (it is not in
the space of word indices like i, j, u, v,m, n). The
recursive form of this generalization operation al-
lows the generation of rules with multiple nonter-
minal pairs.
Chiang (2005) uses features analogous to the
ones used in phrase-based translation: a lan-
guage model neg-log probability, a ?rule given
source-side? neg-log-probability, a ?rule given
target-side? neg-log-probability, source- and tar-
get conditioned ?lexical? neg-log-probabilities
based on word-to-word co-occurrences (Koehn et
al., 2003), as well as rule, target word, and glue
operation counters. We follow Venugopal and
Zollmann (2009) to further add a rareness penalty,
1/ count(r)
where count(r) is the occurrence count of rule
r in the training corpus, allowing the system to
learn penalization of low-frequency rules, as well
as three indicator features firing if the rule has
one, two unswapped, and two swapped nontermi-
nal pairs, respectively.1
3.2 Syntax Augmented MT
Syntax Augmented MT (SAMT) (Zollmann and
Venugopal, 2006) extends Chiang (2005) to in-
clude nonterminal symbols from target language
phrase structure parse trees. Each target sentence
in the training corpus is parsed with a stochas-
tic parser to produce constituent labels for target
spans. Phrase pairs (extracted from a particular
sentence pair) are assigned left-hand-side nonter-
minal symbols based on the target side parse tree
constituent spans.
Phrase pairs whose target side corresponds to
a constituent span are assigned that constituent?s
label as their left-hand-side nonterminal. If the
target side of the phrase pair is not spanned by
a single constituent in the corresponding parse
tree, we use the labels of subsuming, subsumed,
and neighboring parse tree constituents to assign
1Penalization or reward of purely-lexical rules can be in-
directly learned by trading off these features with the rule
counter feature.
112
an extended label of the form C1 + C2, C1/C2,
or C2\C1 (the latter two being motivated from
the operations in combinatory categorial gram-
mar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000)), indicating that the
phrase pair?s target side spans two adjacent syn-
tactic categories (e.g., she went: NP+VB), a par-
tial syntactic category C1 missing aC2 at the right
(e.g., the great: NP/NN), or a partial C1 missing
a C2 at the left (e.g., great wall: DT\NP), respec-
tively. The label assignment is attempted in the or-
der just described, i.e., assembling labels based on
?+? concatenation of two subsumed constituents is
preferred, as smaller constituents tend to be more
accurately labeled. If no label is assignable by ei-
ther of these three methods, a default label ?FAIL?
is assigned.
In addition to the features used in hierarchical
phrase-based MT, SAMT introduces a relative-
frequency estimated probability of the rule given
its left-hand-side nonterminal.
4 Modeling Source Span Length of
PSCFG Rule Substitution Sites
Extracting a rule with k right-hand-side nonter-
minal pairs, i.e., substitution sites, (from now on
called order-k rule) by the method described in
Section 3 involves k + 1 phrase pairs: one phrase
pair used as initial rule and k phrase pairs that are
sub phrase pairs of the first and replaced by non-
terminal pairs. Conversely, during translation, ap-
plying this rule amounts to combining k hypothe-
ses from k different chart cells, each represented
by a source span and a nonterminal, to form a new
hypothesis and file it into a chart cell. Intuitively,
we want the source span lengths of these k + 1
chart cells to be close to the source side lengths of
the k+1 phrase pairs from the training corpus that
were involved in extracting the rule. Of course,
each rule generally was extracted from multiple
training corpus locations, with different involved
phrase pairs of different lengths. We therefore
model k + 1 source span length distributions for
each order-k rule in the grammar.
Ignoring the discreteness of source span length
for the sake of easier estimation, we assume the
distribution to be log-normal. This is motivated
by the fact that source span length is positive and
that we expect its deviation between instances of
the same rule to be greater for long phrase pairs
than for short ones.
We can now add k? + 1 features to the transla-
tion framework, where k? is the maximum num-
ber of PSCFG rule nonterminal pairs, in our case
two. Each feature is computed during translation
time. Ideally, it should represent the probabil-
ity of the hypothesized rule given the respective
chart cell span length. However, as each com-
peting rule underlies a different distribution, this
would require a Bayesian setting, in which priors
over distributions are specified. In this prelimi-
nary work we take a simpler approach: Based on
the rule?s span distribution, we compute the prob-
ability that a span length no likelier than the one
encountered was generated from the distribution.
This probability thus yields a confidence estimate
for the rule. More formally, let ? be the mean and
? the standard deviation of the logarithm of the
span length random variableX concerned, and let
x be the span length encountered during decoding.
Then the computed confidence estimate is given
by
P (| ln(X)? ?| ? | ln(x)? ?|)
= 2 ? Z (?(| ln(x)? ?|)/?)
where Z is the cumulative density function of the
normal distribution with mean zero and variance
one.
The confidence estimate is one if the encoun-
tered span length is equal to the mean of the dis-
tribution, and decreases as the encountered span
length deviates further from the mean. The sever-
ity of that decline is determined by the distribution
variance: the higher the variance, the less a devia-
tion from the mean is penalized.
Mean and variance of log source span length are
sufficient statistics of the log-normal distribution.
As we extract rules in a distributed fashion, we
use a straightforward parallelization of the online
algorithm of Welford (1962) and its improvement
by West (1979) to compute the sample variance
over all instances of a rule.

5 Merging a Hierarchical and a
Syntax-Based Model
While syntax-based grammars allow for more re-
fined statistical models and guide the search by
constraining substitution possibilitites in a gram-
mar derivation, grammar sizes tend to be much
greater than for hierarchical grammars. Therefore
the average occurrence count of a syntax rule is
much lower than that of a hierarchical rule, and
thus estimated probabilitites are less reliable.
We propose to augment the syntax-based ?rule
given source side? and ?rule given target side? dis-
tributions by hierarchical counterparts obtained by
marginalizing over the left-hand-side and right-
hand-side rule nonterminals. For example, the
hierarchical equivalent of the ?rule given source
side? probability is obtained by summing occur-
rence counts over all rules that have the same
source and target terminals and substitution posi-
tions but possibly differ in the left- and/or right-
hand side nonterminal labels, divided by the sum
of occurrence counts of all rules that have the
same source side terminals and source side substi-
tution positions. Similarly, an alternative rareness
penalty based on the combined frequency of all
rules with the same terminals and substitution po-
sitions is obtained.
Using these syntax and hierarchical features
side by side amounts to interpolation of the re-
spective probability models in log-space, with
minimum-error-rate training (MERT) determining
the optimal interpolation coefficient. We also add
respective models interpolated with coefficient .5
in probability-space as additional features to the
system.
We further experiment with adding hierarchical
rules separately to the syntax-augmented gram-
mar, as proposed in Zollmann et al (2008), with
the respective syntax-specific features set to zero.
A ?hierarchical-indicator? feature is added to all
rules, which is one for hierarchical rules and zero
for syntax rules, allowing the joint model to trade
of hierarchical against syntactic rules. During
translation, the hierarchical and syntax worlds are
bridged by glue rules, which allow monotonic
concatenation of hierarchical and syntactic partial
sentence hypotheses. We separate the glue feature
used in hierarchical and syntax-augmented trans-
lation into a glue feature that only fires when a hi-
erarchical rule is glued, and a distinct glue feature
firing when gluing a syntax-augmented rule.
6 Extension of SAMT to a bilingually
parsed corpus
Syntax-based MT models have been proposed
both based on target-side syntactic annotations
(Galley et al, 2004; Zollmann and Venugopal,
2006) as well source-side annotations (Liu et al,
2006). Syntactic annotations for both source and
target language are available for popular language
pairs such as Chinese-English. In this case, our
grammar extraction procedure can be easily ex-
tended to impose both source and target con-
straints on the eligible substitutions simultane-
ously.
Let Nf be the nonterminal label that would be
assigned to a given initial rule when utilizing the
source-side parse tree, and Ne the assigned label
according to the target-side parse. Then our bilin-
gual model assigns ?Nf + Ne? to the initial rule.
The extraction of complex rules proceeds as be-
fore. The number of nonterminals in this model,
based on a source-model label set of size s and a
target label set of size t, is thus given by st.
7 Experiments
We evaluate our approaches by comparing trans-
lation quality according to the IBM-BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) metric on the NIST Chinese-
to-English translation task using MT04 as devel-
opment set to train the model parameters ?, and
MT05, MT06 and MT08 as test sets.
We perform PSCFG rule extraction and de-
coding using the open-source ?SAMT? system
(Venugopal and Zollmann, 2009), using the pro-
vided implementations for the hierarchical and
syntax-augmented grammars. For all systems, we
use the bottom-up chart parsing decoder imple-
mented in the SAMT toolkit with a reordering
limit of 15 source words, and correspondingly ex-
tract rules from initial phrase pairs of maximum
source length 15. All rules have at most two non-
terminal symbols, which must be non-consecutive
on the source side, and rules must contain at least
114
one source-side terminal symbol.
For parameter tuning, we use the L0-
regularized minimum-error-rate training tool pro-
vided by the SAMT toolkit.
The parallel training data comprises of 9.6M
sentence pairs (206M Chinese Words, 228M En-
glish words). The source and target language
parses for the syntax-augmented grammar were
generated by the Stanford parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003).
The results are given in Table 1. The source
span models (indicated by +span) achieve small
test set improvements of 0.15 BLEU points on av-
erage for the hierarchical and 0.26 BLEU points
for the syntax-augmented system, but these are
not statistically significant.
Augmenting a syntax-augmented grammar
with hierarchical features (?Syntax+hiermodels?)
results in average test set improvements of 0.5
BLEU points. These improvements are not sta-
tistically significant either, but persist across all
three test sets. This demonstrates the benefit of
more reliable feature estimation. Further aug-
menting the hierarchical rules to the grammar
(?Syntax+hiermodels+hierrules?) does not yield
additional improvements.
The use of bilingual syntactic parses (?Syn-
tax/src&tgt?) turns out detrimental to translation
quality. We assume this is due to the huge number
of nonterminals in these grammars and the great
amount of badly-estimated low-occurrence-count
rules. Perhaps merging this grammar with a regu-
lar syntax-augmented grammar could yield better
results.
We also experimented with a source-parse
based model (?Syntax/src?). While not being able
to match translation quality of its target-based
counterpart, the model still outperforms the hier-
archical system on all test sets.
8 Conclusion
We proposed several improvements to the hierar-
chical phrase-based MT model of Chiang (2005)
and its syntax-based extension by Zollmann and
Venugopal (2006). We added a source span length
model that, for each rule utilized in a probabilis-
tic synchronous context-free grammar (PSCFG)
derivation, gives a confidence estimate in the rule
based on the number of source words spanned by
the rule and its substituted child rules, resulting in
small improvements for hierarchical phrase-based
as well as syntax-augmented MT.
We further demonstrated the utility of combin-
ing hierarchical and syntax-based PSCFG models
and grammars.
Finally, we compared syntax-augmented MT,
which extracts rules based on target-side syntax,
to a corresponding variant based on source-side
syntax, showing that target syntax is more ben-
efitial, and unsuccessfully experimented with a
model extension that jointly takes source and tar-
get syntax into account.
Hierarchical phrase-based MT suffers from
spurious ambiguity: A single translation for a
given source sentence can usually be accom-
plished by many different PSCFG derivations.
This problem is exacerbated by syntax-augmented
MT with its thousands of nonterminals, and made
even worse by its joint source-and-target exten-
sion. Future research should apply the work of
Blunsom et al (2008) and Blunsom and Osborne
(2008), who marginalize over derivations to find
the most probable translation rather than the most
probable derivation, to these multi-nonterminal
grammars.
