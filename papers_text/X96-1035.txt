INTRODUCTION 
Multilingual text retrieval extends the basic mono- 
lingual detection task to include retrieving relevant doc- 
uments in languages other than the query language. The 
task therefore merges efforts in machine translation with 
efforts in text retrieval, but the machine translation com- 
ponent may be substantially simplified due to some 
basic assumptions about he design and implementation 
of high-performance text retrieval systems. A primary 
consideration is that most modem text retrieval systems 
regard queries and documents as unordered "bags" of 
words. The translation of an unordered set of terms is 
therefore approximately the translation of the terms 
themselves. Although a linearity assumption such as this 
breaks down when considering phrasal elements in most 
languages, it is reasonably accurate for many terms and 
becomes increasingly accurate at the sentence l vel and 
above. 
A second consideration i  multilingual text retrieval 
is where the translation is done. It is possible to translate 
every document at index time, for example, but the 
resource costs are substantially higher than translating 
the query at retrieval time. An added benefit of translat- 
ing only the query is that queries can be prepared with 
no special weighting scheme applied to the terms. The 
queries are then available to any natural anguage text 
retrieval system. 
The range of translation techniques that are avail- 
able to a query translation system is greater than in stan- 
dard machine translation systems. Previously translated 
document corpora can be made available for exploiting 
domain-specific terminology by direct comparison of 
the retrieval results for the query and target document 
languages. No special heuristics are needed for using 
this "example-based" translation approach; the query 
can be optimized by adding or deleting terms until the 
target language retrieval results are approximately the 
same as the source language retrieval results. Lexical- 
transfer techniques can also be used in the same context, 
providing wide coverage of term senses. 
CRL evaluated five methods for query translation i  
Tipster II. The results were then evaluated in TREC by 
hand-translating the TREC Spanish monolingual que- 
ries into English and applying the automatic query 
translation methods to produce new Spanish queries. 
Ongoing work is focusing on improving the perfor- 
mance of query translation techniques while expanding 
the techniques to work with new languages and search 
engines, including WWW search services. 
MLTR IN  TREC 
Starting with TREC- 3, Spanish corpora nd query 
sets have been available for evaluating text retrieval 
engines. The queries and corpus are monolingual, how- 
ever, so testing a multilingual system is only possible if 
the query set or the corpus is translated into a different 
language. We chose to translate the queries since they 
were very short. With translated queries, aquery transla- 
tion system that produces Spanish queries from hand- 
translated English versions of original Spanish queries 
can then be compared against he original queries. The 
differences between the two results are then a reason- 
able measure of the effectiveness of the translation pro- 
cess in preserving the characteristics of the original 
query that contribute to retrieval. Several of the Spanish 
TREC queries and their hand-translated versions are 
shown in Table 1, below. 
The query translation methods that we applied to 
produce new Spanish queries were of two major types: 
methods that used a prepared lexicon and methods that 
used a parallel training corpus. While a lexicon tends to 
produce translations that are shallow but comprehen- 
sive, covering all possible senses of a term but limited in 
the range of synonyms that are produced for each term, 
corpus methods tend to produce translations that are 
deep but narrow, with enormous repetition of domain- 
related senses of terminology. This justified an examina- 
tion of the comparative merits of both approaches. 
As is often the case, our parallel corpus was not 
precisely of the same domain as the TREC document 
185 
collection for the ultimate valuation. The corpus itself 
was extremely large, however, which we hoped would 
offset the difficulties of using a distinctly different ype 
of text. The corpus was 1.6 Gb of Spanish and English 
translations from the United Nations, containing pro- 
ceedings of meetings, policy documents and notes on 
UN activities in member countries. The documents were 
automatically aligned \[1\] at the sentence level using a 
procedure that is conservatively estimated to have an 
83% accuracy over grossly noisy document pairs (which 
the UN documents were not). This produced a parallel 
corpus of around 680,000 aligned sentence pairs. 
Lexical Transfer 
The first method was to perform term-by-term 
translation with the Collins English-Spanish bilingual 
dictionary. Individual terms in the English query were 
reduced to their morphological roots and lookup was 
performed. The resulting set of Spanish terms became 
the Spanish query. Some repetition of terms is apparent 
in the resulting queries because all senses of each term 
were used with no attempt to disambiguate he contex- 
tual usage of the English terms. For example, Query 28 
is transformed from

relations between Mexico and Asian 
countries, such as Japan, China and 
Korea.

Note that "China" has been replaced with both 
"China" and "porcelana" as a result of this simple lexi- 
cal substitution scheme, and that "relations" has 
included the familial sense "parentesco". Lexicon-gen- 
erated Spanish Queries 
The lexical-transfer approach produced Spanish 
queries rapidly, requiring only a simple database lookup 
procedure. This process is shown in Figure 1 (a). 
High-Frequency Terms from Parallel Text 
In text, the terms that occur with the highest fre- 
quency are rarely of statistical significance, and are 
more often than not merely redundant. Yet the terms that 
occur with moderate frequency are sometimes ignifi- 
cant. In order to evaluate other corpus-based methods, 
we wanted to establish a baseline for queries formed 
from these moderate frequency term sets. Using a vec- 
tor-based text retrieval system with no term spreading or 
other modifications, the English queries were translated 
by performing a lookup on the English side of the paral- 
lel corpus, collecting the Spanish sentences that were 
parallels to the top 100 retrieved ocuments, filtering the 
remaining terms to eliminate the top 500 most frequent 
Spanish terms, and collecting the next 100 most fre- 
quent Spanish terms to create the new query. This pro- 
cess is shown in Figure 1 (b): 
Several of the resulting queries are given in Table 2. 
Some formatting codes from the UN documents have 
been eliminated in some of the queries, reducing the 
count to below 100 terms in those queries. For brevity, 
only the first two queries are shown in Table 2. 
Statistically Significant Terms 
Whereas the high-frequency terms extracted in the 
previous method provide a baseline for examining 
improved methods, high-frequency terms are them- 
selves not necessarily the best terms for discriminating 
the significant features involved in text retrieval. A bet- 
ter approach is to extract he terms which are statisti- 
cally significant in the retrieved segments of parallel text 
in comparison to the corpus as a whole. Various meth- 
ods are possible for testing statistical significance, but 
the method we applied is based on a log-likelihood ratio 
test that assumes a X 2 distribution is an accurate model 
of the term distributions in text \[2\]. 
The method begins by extracting all of the terms 
from the sentences that are parallels to the top 100 
retrieved English sentences. The counts of the pooled 
terms are then compared with the counts for the entire 
UN training corpus to evaluate their statistical signifi- 
cance. The top 100 most-significant terms are then 
extracted and become the new Spanish query. Figure 1 
(c) diagrams the process. The resulting queries are in 
Table 3, below.s 
Evolutionary Optimization of Queries 
If we could make a set of derived Spanish queries 
retrieve documents in a manner that is similar to the 
English queries over a training corpus, then the Spanish 
query could conceivably produce similar results on a 
novel corpus. One way to change Spanish queries is to 
add and remove terms. The number of possible unique 
deletions that can be performed on a 70 word query is 
186 
quite large, however, making the direct examination of 
all possible modified queries effectively impossible. 
We applied an evolutionary programming (EP) \[3\] 
approach to modify a population of 50 queries. In an EP 
approach, an initial population of queries is needed 
along with a mutation strategy to modify queries. Opti- 
mization then proceeds by evaluating the comparative 
fitnesses of the queries, mutating a selected sub-popula- 
tion of the queries to produce "offspring" solutions and 
re-evaluating the queries iteratively until a suitable num- 
ber of generations have passed. Our EP approach con- 
sidered the comparative evaluation of document score 
vectors as an objective measure of the relative fitness of 
a query to the collection. This process is diagrammed in
Figure 1 (d). 
The initial queries for this test were the queries 
from the high-frequency lookup strategy discussed 
above. Previously, we have used a lexicon to generate 
initial queries \[4\]. The mutation strategy applied 
between one and ten modification operations to each of 
the 50 queries per generation and collected only the best 
10% of the queries to propagate into the next generation. 
Optimization proceeded for 50 generations, resulting in 
a wide range of changes to each query. 
The types of queries produced by this system typi- 
cally showed the repetition of key terminology com- 
bined with the elimination of irrelevant erms. The 
fitness judgment for a query was based on comparative 
retrieval results using a training corpus of only 80,000 
aligned sentences. Table 4, below, shows two of the 
resulting queries from the EP method. 
Singular Value Decomposition and the 
Translation Matrix 
The final query translation method was a radical 
departure from the others, but is derived from earlier 
work by \[5\] and \[6\]. This method is at heart a numerical 
approach to derive a translation matrix from parallel 
texts. 
In this effort, we applied a QR-decomposition tech- 
nique to reduce the complexity of calculating the singu- 
lar value decomposition, resulting in query translation 
that took only a matter of seconds on a SPARC 10. Sev- 
eral of the generated queries are given in Table 6. Fig- 
ure 1 (e) diagrams the process. 
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS 
The resulting queries were given to University of 
Massachusetts, Amherst, who ran them against the 
Spanish TREC document collection using Spanish 
Inquery. The original Spanish TREC queries were also 
evaluated to establish a reference baseline. The results 
were as follows: 
1. On average, the dictionary-based queries produced 
performance which was about 50% worse than the 
reference queries. 
2. The EP-derived queries produced performance 
which was 60-70% worse than the reference que- 
ries, except at higher ecall evels (.6-1.0), at which 
they performed better than the Method 1 queries. 
3. The other methods performed even more poorly. 
4. On at least wo queries, performance of the lexical 
methods was as good or better than the reference 
queries. 
5. On two queries, performance of the EP approach 
was as good as the reference queries, although they 
tended to have better precision at higher ecall. 
These modest results demonstrate hat lexical and 
corpus methods can be applied to query translation i  a 
large-scale multilingual text retrieval scenario, although 
at a fair penalty in performance. Each of these methods 
was purposely limited to as simple a scheme as possible, 
however, so there is plenty of room for improvement 
and further experimentation.The average precision- 
recall curve for all 25 queries is shown in Figure 2. 
RECENT AND ONGOING WORK 
Current work is focusing on improving the perfor- 
mance of MLTR methods, applying the methods to new 
languages and making use of new retrieval engines. 
An example of the latter is shown in Figure 3. Mun- 
dial is a query interface to Infoseek and Yahoo that takes 
queries in English, translates them to Spanish and sub- 
mits the resulting queries to the Infoseek and Yahoo 
search engines directly. Figure 4 shows the completed 
search for Spanish documents on Infoseek. The Mundial 
demo uses a bilingual dictionary combined with several 
heuristics to limit the terminological expansion of the 
input query. Limiting query size is important because 
most search engines, like Infoseek, restrict he size of a 
query to around 80 characters. Overgeneration i  the 
translation process is handled by using the longest erms 
(in character count) in Mundial. Although in some cases 
this may be in error, the hope is that automatic stem- 
ming of query terms at the search engine will reduce 
long terms to stems common to many of the keywords 
that might have been substituted if the entire definition 
was transferred. The second motivation was that long 
187 
terms tend to be more precise than short terms, and con- 
tent words should be as precise as possible.
