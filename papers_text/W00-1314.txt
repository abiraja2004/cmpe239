Abstract 
In this paper, a method for the word alignment 
of English-Chinese corpus based on chunks is 
proposed. The chunks of English sentences are 
identified firstly. Then the chunk boundaries of 
Chinese sentences are predicted by the 
translations of English chunks and heuristic 
information. The ambiguities of Chinese chunk 
boundaries are resolved by the coterminous 
words in English chunks. With the chunk 
aligned bilingual corpus, a translation relation 
probability is proposed to align words. Finally, 
we evaluate our system by real corpus and 
present the experiment results. 
Key Words: Word Alignment, Chunk Alignment, 
Bilingual Corpus, Lexicon Extraction 
1 Introduction 
With the easier access to bilingual corpora, there 
is a tendency in NLP community to process and 
refine the bilingual corpora, which can serve as 
the knowledge base in support of many NLP 
applications, such as automatic or human-aid 
translation, multilingual terminology and 
lexicography, multilingual information retrieval 
system, etc. 
Different NLP applications need different 
bilingual corpora, which are aligned at different 
level. They can be divided by the nature of the 
segment to section level, paragraph level, 
sentence level, phrase level, word level, byte 
level, etc. 
As for our applications, we choose the chunk 
level to do alignment based on following 
considerations. Firstly, our applications, which 
include an example-based machine translation 
system, a computer aid translation system and a 
multilingual information retrieval system, need 
the alignment below the sentence level, on 
which we can acquire bilingual word and phrase 
dictionaries and. other useful translation 
information. Secondly, the word level alignment 
between English and Chinese language is 
difficult to deal with. There are no cognate 
words. The change in Chinese word order and 
word POS always produce many null and 
mistake correspondences. Next, we observe the 
phenomenon that when we translate the English 
sentence to Chinese sentence, all the words in 
one English chunk tend to be translated as one 
block of Chinese words which are coterminous. 
The word orders within these blocks tend to 
keep with the English chunk, also. So there are 
stronger boundaries between chunks than 
between words when we translate texts. Finally, 
as we all known, chunk has been assigned 
syntactic structure (Steven Abney, 1991), which 
comprises a connected sub-graph of the 
sentence's parse tree. So it's possible to align 
sentence structure and obtain translation 
grammars based on chunks by parsing. 
Many researchers have studied the text 
alignment problem and a number of quite 
encouraging results have been reported to 
different level alignments. With 
sentence-aligned corpus ready in hand, we focus 
our attention on the intra-sentence alignment 
between the sentence pairs. In this paper, a 
method for the word alignment of 
English-Chinese corpus based on chunks is 
proposed. The chunks of English sentences are 
identified firstly. Then the chunk boundaries of 
Chinese sentences are predicted by the bilingual 
lexicon and synonymy Chinese dictionary and 
heuristic information. The ambiguities of 
Chinese chunk boundaries are resolved by the 
coterminous words in English chunks. With the 
110 
chunk aligned bilingual corpus, a translation 
relation probability is proposed to align words. 
Although this paper is related to 
English-Chinese word alignment, he idea can 
be used to any other language bilingual corpora. 
In the following sections, we first present a brief 
review of related work in word alignment. Then 
discuss our alignment algorithm based on 
chunks in detail. Following this is an analysis of 
our experimental results. Finally, we close our 
paper with a discussion of future work. 
2 Related Work 
There are basically two kinds of approaches on 
word alignment: he statistical-based approaches 
(Brown et. al., 1990; Gale & Church, 1991; 
Dagan et. al. 1993; Chang, 1994), and the 
lexicon-based approaches (Ker & Chang, 1997; 
Wang et. al., 1999). 
Several translation models based on word 
alignment are built by Brown et al (1990) in 
order to implement the English-French 
statistical machine translation. The probabilities, 
such as translation probability, fertility 
probability, distortion probability, are estimated 
by EM algorithm. The Z 2 measure is used by 
Gale & Church (1991) to align partial words. 
Dagan (1993) uses an improved Brown model to 
align the words for texts including OCR noise. 
They first align word partially by character 
string matching. Then use the translation model 
to align words. Chang (1994) uses the POS 
probability rather than translation probability in 
Brown model to align the English-Chinese POS 
tagged corpus. Ker & Chang (1997) propose an 
approach to align Chinese English corpus based 
on semantic class. There are two semantic 
classes are used in their model. One is the 
semantic class of Longman lexicon of 
contemporary English, the other is synonymy 
Chinese dictionary. The semantic lass rules of 
translation between Chinese and English are 
extracted from large-scale training corpus. Then 
Chinese and English words are aligned by these 
rules. Wang (1999) also uses the lexicons to 
align the Chinese English bilingual corpus. His 
model is based on bilingual lexicon, sense 
similarity and location distortion probability. 
The statistical-based approaches need complex 
training and are sensitive to training data. It's a 
pity that almost no linguistic knowledge is used 
in these approaches. The lexicon-based 
approaches seem simplify the word alignment 
problem and can't obtain much translation 
information above word level. To combine these 
two approaches in a better way is the direction 
in near future. In this paper we proposed a 
method to align the bilingual corpus base on 
chunks. The linguistic knowledge such as POS 
tag and Chunk tag are used in a simply 
statistical model. 
3 Alignment Algorithm 
3.1 Outline of Algorithm 
For our procedure in this paper, the bilingual 
corpus has been aligned at the sentence l vel, 
and the English language texts have been tagged 
with POS tag, and the Chinese language texts 
have been segmented and tagged with POS tag. 
We have available a bilingual lexicon which 
lists typical translation for many of the words in 
the corpus. We have available a synonymy 
Chinese dictionary, also. We identify the chunks 
of English sentences and then predict he chunk 
boundaries of Chinese sentences from the 
translation of every English chunks and 
heuristic information by use of the bilingual 
lexicon. The ambiguities of Chinese chunk 
boundaries are resolved by the coterminous 
words in English chunks. After produce the 
word candidate sets by statistical method, we 
calculate the translation relation probability 
between every word pair and select the best 
alignment forms. The detail algorithm for word 
alignment is given in table 1. 
Step 1: According to the definition of Chunk in 
English, separate the English sentence into 
a few chunks and labeled with order 
number from left to fight. 
Step 2: Try to find the Chinese translation of 
every English chunk created in step 1 by 
bilingual dictionary and synonymy Chinese 
dictionary. If the Chinese translation is fred, 
then label the Chinese words with the same 
number used for the English chunk in step 
1. 
Step 3: Disambiguate the multi-label Chinese 
words by the translation location of 
coterminous words within the same English 
chunk. 
Step 4: Separate the Chinese sentence into a few 
chunks by heuristic information. 
Step 5: Save all the alignment at chunk level in 
111 
whole corpus as a base for word alignment. 
Step 6: Produce the word candidate sets by 
statistical method. 
Step 7: Calculate the translation relation 
probability between every word and it's 
candidate translation words. 
Step 8: Select he best translation by comparing 
the total TRP value in different alignment 
forms.

3.2 Chunk Identifying of English 
Sentence 
Following Steven Abney (1991), there are two 
separate stages in chunking parser, which is the 
chunker and the attacher. The chunker converts 
a stream of words into a stream of chunks, and 
the attacher converts the stream of chunks into a 
stream of sentences. So only the chunker is 
needed in this paper. It's a non-deterministic 
version of a LR parser. For detail about chunker 
and the used grammars, please see Abney 
(1991). Then the chunks in one sentence are 
labeled with order number from left to right. 
3.3 Chunk Boundary Prediction of 
Chinese Sentence 
We observe the phenomenon that when we 
translate the English sentence to Chinese 
sentence, all the words in one English chunk 
tend to be translated as one block of Chinese 
words that are coterminous. The word orders 
within these blocks tend to keep with the 
English chunk, also. There are three examples in 
figure 1. The first sentence pair is chosen from 
an example sentence of Abney (1991). The 
second sentence pair is from a computer 
handbook. In these sentence pair all English 
chunks can find the exactly Chinese Chunk. In 
the third sentence pair only one English chunk 
can't find the exactly Chinese chunk for this 
sentence is chosen from a story and the 
translation is not literally. 
In order to find the Chinese translation of every 
English chunk, we use the bilingual dictionary 
and synonymy Chinese dictionary to implement 
the matching. If the Chinese translation of any 
words within the English chunk is found, then 
label the Chinese word with the same number 
used for labeling the English chunk. 
If there are Chinese words, which are labeled 
simultaneously by two or more number of 
English chunks, we use the number of nearby 
Chinese words to disambiguate. For example, in 
figure 2, the first Chinese word /~ j  may be 
correspondent to the English chunk 5 or 7. We 
have known that the words in one English chunk 
tend to be translated as one block of Chinese 
words that are coterminous, So it's easy to 
decide the first Chinese word )x~ ffJ is 
correspondent to the English chunk 7, the second 
Chinese word )x~ ~ is correspondent to the 
English chunk 5. By the same way, we can find 
the correct ranslations of Chinese word ~ 
and ~ is English chunk 6 and chunk 8 
respectively. In Step 4 of figure 2, the Chinese 
words with the same label number are bracketed 
with in one chunk. Finally, we separate the 
Chinese sentence into a few chunks by heuristic 
information based on POS tag (especially the 
preposition, conjunction, and auxiliary words) 
and the grammatical knowledge-base of 
contemporary Chinese (Yu shi wen, 1998).

3.4 Calculation of Translation Relation 
Probability for Words 
With the alignments at chunk level of whole 
corpus, we propose a Translation Relation 
Probability (TRP) to implement the word 
alignment. The translation Relation probability 
of words are given by following equation: 
P~ - L:~ (1) 
L 'L  
Where f? is the frequency of English word in 
whole corpus; fc is the frequency of Chinese 
Word in whole corpus; f~ is calculated by 
follow equation: 
N /ln( 2Lay ) + ln(Lav) 
I L~i + Lci 
(2) 
Where Lmv is the average words number of all 
English chunks and all Chinese chunks which 
are related to the English word in whole Corpus; 
L~i is the word number of the English chunk in 
which the English candidate words co-occur 
with the Chinese words; ~ is the word number 
of the Chinese chunk in which the English 
candidate words co-occur with the Chinese 
words; N is the total number of chunks in which 
the English word co-occur with the Chinese 
word; 13?e is the penalty value to indicate the 
POS change between the Engfish word and the 
Chinese word. 
By this equation we connect he chunk length 
and POS change with the co-occurrence 
frequency. The less the chunk length, the higher 
the translation relation probability. For example, 
the chunk pak, which is composed by one 
English word and two Chinese words, is more 
reliable than the chunk pair, which is composed 
by four English words and four Chinese words. 
An example is given in figure 3. There are 5 
possible alignment forms in our consideration 
for this chunk, which includes three Engfish 
words and three Chinese words. Then calculate 
the total TRP value for every possible alignment 
word pairs in each alignment form by equation 
(1). After we get the total TRP value for each 
alignment form, we choose the biggest one.

4.2 Experiment Results 
We tested our system with an English-Chinese 
bilingual corpus, which is part of a computer 
handbook (Sco Unix handbook). There are 
about 2246 English sentence and 2169 Chinese 
sentence in this computer handbook after filter 
noisy figures and tables. Finally we extracted 
14,214 chunk pairs from the corpus. The 
accuracy for automatic chunk alignment is 
85.7%. The accuracy for word alignment based 
on correctly aligned chunk pairs is 93.6%. The 
errors mainly due to the following reasons: 
Chinese segmentation error, stop words noise, 
POS tag error. The parameter 13ec we used in 
equation (2) should be chosen from the training 
corpus. In table 2, the total TRP values of 
example in figure 3 are showed. The alignment 
form D is the best.

5 Conclusions and Future Work 
With the more and more bilingual corpora, there 
is a tendency in NLP community to process and 
refine the bilingual corpora, which can serve as 
the knowledge base in support of many NLP 
applications. In this paper, a method for the 
word alignment of English-Chinese corpus 
based on chunks is presented. After identified 
the chunks of English sentences, we predict he 
chunk boundaries of Chinese sentences by the 
bilingual exicon, synonymy Chinese dictionary 
and heuristic information. The ambiguities of 
Chinese chunk boundaries are resolved by the 
coterminous words in English chunks. After 
produce the word candidate sets by statistical 
method, we calculate the translation relation 
probability between every word pair and select 
the best alignment forms. We evaluate our 
system by real corpus and present the results. 
Although the results we got are quite promising 
to bilingual English Chinese text, there are still 
much to do in near future. The corpus we use in 
our experinaent is a relative small corpus about 
computer handbook, in which the terms are 
translated with high consistency. We should 
extend our method to the large corpus of other 
domains without lost much accuracy. To 
increase the correct rate of Chinese word 
segmentation is important for our word 
alignment. To extract he corresponding syntax 
information of English Chinese bilingual corpus 
by shallow parsing is a direction for future work, 
also.
