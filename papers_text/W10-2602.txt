Abstract
We report results from a domain adapta-
tion task for statistical machine translation
(SMT) using cache-based adaptive lan-
guage and translation models. We apply
an exponential decay factor and integrate
the cache models in a standard phrase-
based SMT decoder. Without the need for
any domain-specific resources we obtain a
2.6% relative improvement on average in
BLEU scores using our dynamic adapta-
tion procedure.
1 Introduction
Most data-driven approaches to natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) are subject to the well-
known problem of lack of portability to new do-
mains/genres. Usually there is a substantial drop
in performance when testing on data from a do-
main different to the training data. Statistical ma-
chine translation is no exception. Despite its pop-
ularity, standard SMT approaches fail to provide a
framework for general application across domains
unless appropriate training data is available and
used in parameter estimation and tuning.
The main problem is the general assumption
of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
variables in machine learning approaches applied
in the estimation of static global models. Recently,
there has been quite some attention to the prob-
lem of domain switching in SMT (Zhao et al,
2004; Ueffing et al, 2007; Civera and Juan, 2007;
Bertoldi and Federico, 2009) but ground breaking
success is still missing. In this paper we report
our findings in dynamic model adaptation using
cache-based techniques when applying a standard
model to the task of translating documents from a
very different domain.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as
follows: First, we will motivate the chosen ap-
proach by reviewing the general phenomenon of
repetition and consistency in natural language text.
Thereafter, we will briefly discuss the dynamic ex-
tensions to language and translation models ap-
plied in the experiments presented in the second
last section followed by some final conclusions.
2 Motivation
Domain adaptation can be tackled in various ways.
An obvious choice for empirical systems is to ap-
ply supervised techniques in case domain-specific
training data is available. It has been shown that
small(er) amounts of in-domain data are suffi-
cient for such an approach (Koehn and Schroeder,
2007). However, this is not really a useful alter-
native for truly open-domain systems, which will
be confronted with changing domains all the time
including many new, previously unknown ones
among them.
There are also some interesting approaches to
dynamic domain adaptation mainly using flexible
mixture models or techniques for the automatic se-
lection of appropriate resources (Hildebrand et al,
2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Finch and Sumita,
2008). Ideally, a system would adjust itself to the
current context (and thus to the current domain)
without the need of explicit topic mixtures. There-
fore, we like to investigate techniques for general
context adaptation and their use in out-of-domain
translation.
There are two types of properties in natural lan-
guage and translation that we like to explore. First
of all, repetition is very common ? much more
than standard stochastic language models would
predict. This is especially true for content words.
See, for instance, the sample of a medical docu-
ment shown in figure 1. Many content words are
repeated in close context. Hence, appropriate lan-
guage models should incorporate changing occur-
rence likelihoods to account for these very com-
mon repetitions. This is exactly what adaptive lan-
guage models try to do (Bellegarda, 2004).

prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to

for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .?

the European Medicines Agency (EMEA)
Another known fact about natural language is con-
sistency which is also often ignored in statistical
models. A main problem in most NLP applica-
tions is ambiguity. However, ambiguity is largely
removed within specific domains and contexts in
which ambiguous items have a well-defined and
consistent meaning. This effect of ?meaning con-
sistency? also known as the principle of ?one sense
per discourse? has been applied in word sense
disambiguation with quite some success (Gale et
al., 1992). For machine translation this means
that adapting to the local domain and sticking to
consistent translation choices within a discourse
seems to be better than using a global static model
and context independent translations of sentences
in isolation. For an illustration, look at the exam-
ples in figure 2 taken from translated movie subti-
tles. Interesting is not only the consistent meaning
of ?honey? within each discourse but also the con-
sistent choice among equivalent translations (syn-
onyms ?a?lskling? och ?gumman?). Here, the dis-
tinction between ?honey? and ?sweetheart? has
been transferred to Swedish using consistent trans-
lations.

Figure 2: Consistency in subtitle translations
In summary: Repetition and consistency are very
important when modeling natural language and
translation. A proper translation engine should
move away from translating sentences in isolation
but should consider wider context to include these
discourse phenomena. In the next section we dis-
cuss the cache-based models that we implemented
to address this challenge.
3 Cache-based Models
The main idea behind cache-based language mod-
els (Kuhn and Mori, 1990) is to mix a large global
(static) language model with a small local (dy-
namic) model estimated from recent items in the
history of the input stream. It is common to use
simple linear interpolations and fixed cache sizes k
(100-5000 words) to achieve this: P (wn|history) =
(1? ?)Pn?gram(wn|history) + ?Pcache(wn|history)
Due to data sparseness one is usually restricted
to simple cache models. However, unigram mod-
els are often sufficient and smoothing is not nec-
essary due to the interpolation with the smoothed
background model. From the language model-
ing literature we know that caching is an effi-
cient way to reduce perplexity (usually leading to
modest improvements on in-domain data and large
improvements on out-of-domain data). Table 1
shows this effect yielding 53% reduction of per-
plexity on our out-of-domain data.

Table 1: Perplexity of medical texts (EMEA) us-
ing a language model estimated on Europarl and a
unigram cache component
Even though a simple unigram cache is quite ef-
fective it now requires a careful optimization of its
size. In order to avoid the dependence on cache
size and to account for recency a decaying factor
can be introduced (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997):
Pcache(wn|wn?k..wn?1) ?
1
Z
n?1?
i=n?k
I(wn = wi)e
??(n?i)
Here, I(A) = 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise. Z
is a normalizing constant. Figure 3 illustrates the
effect of cache decay on our data yielding another
significant reduction in perplexity (even though

the improvement is much less impressive than the
one obtained by introducing the cache).
The motivation of using these successful tech-
niques in SMT is obvious. Language models play
a crucial role in fluency ranking and a better fit
to real data (supporting the tendency of repetition)
should be preferred. This, of course, assumes cor-
rect translation decisions in the history in our SMT
setting which will almost never be the case. Fur-
thermore, simple cache models like the unigram
model may wrongly push forward certain expres-
sions without considering local context when us-
ing language models to discriminate between var-
ious translation candidates. Therefore, success-
fully applying these adaptive language models in
SMT is surprisingly difficult (Raab, 2007) espe-
cially due to the risk of adding noise (leading to
error propagation) and corrupting local dependen-
cies.
In SMT another type of adaptation can be ap-
plied: cache-based adaptation of the translation
model. Here, not only the repetition of content
words is supported but also the consistency of
translations as discussed earlier. This technique
has already been tried in the context of interactive
machine translation (Nepveu et al, 2004) in which
cache features are introduced to adapt both the lan-
guage model and the translation model. However,
in their model they require an automatic align-
ment of words in the user edited translation and the
source language input. In our experiments we in-
vestigate a close integration of the caching proce-
dure into the decoding process of fully automatic
translation. For this, we fill our cache with trans-
lation options used in the best (final) translation
hypothesis of previous sentences. In our imple-
mentation of the translation model cache we use
again a decaying factor in order to account for re-
cency. For known source language items (fn for
which translation options exist in the cache) the
following formula is used to compute the cache
translation score:
?cache(en|fn) =
?K
i=1 I(?en, fn? = ?ei, fi?) ? e
??i
?K
i=1 I(fn = fi)
Unknown items receive a score of zero. This score
is then used as an additional feature in the standard
log-linear model of phrase-based SMT1.
4 Experiments
Our experiments are focused on the unsupervised
dynamic adaptation of language and translation
models to a new domain using the cache-based
mixture models as described above. We apply
these techniques to a standard task of translat-
ing French to English using a model trained on
the publicly available Europarl corpus (Koehn,
2005) using standard settings and tools such as the
Moses toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007), GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) and SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The
log-linear model is then tuned as usual with mini-
mum error rate training (Och, 2003) on a separate
development set coming from the same domain
(Europarl). We modified SRILM to include a de-
caying cache model and implemented the phrase
translation cache within the Moses decoder. Fur-
thermore, we added the caching procedures and
other features for testing the adaptive approach.
Now we can simply switch the cache models on
or off using additional command-line arguments
when running Moses as usual.
4.1 Experimental Setup
For testing we chose to use documents from the
medical domain coming from the EMEA corpus
that is part of the freely available collection of
parallel corpora OPUS2 (Tiedemann, 2009). The
reason for selecting this domain is that these doc-
uments include very consistent instructions and
repetitive texts which ought to favor our caching
techniques. Furthermore, they are very different

from the training data and, thus, domain adapta-
tion is very important for proper translations. We
randomly selected 102 pairs of documents with al-
together 5,478 sentences. Sentences have an aver-
age length of about 19 tokens with a lot of varia-
tion among them. Documents are compiled from
the European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR)
which reflect scientific conclusions at the end of a
centralized evaluation procedure for medical prod-
ucts. They include a lot of domain-specific ter-
minology, short facts, lists and tables but also de-
tailed textual descriptions of medicines and their
use. The overall lowercased type/token ratio in the
English part of our test collection is about 0.045
which indicates quite substantial repetitions in the
text. This ratio is, however, much higher for indi-
vidual documents.
In the experiment each document is processed
individually in order to apply appropriate dis-
course breaks. The baseline score for applying a
standard phrase-based SMT model yields an aver-
age score of 28.67 BLEU per document (28.60 per
sentence) which is quite reasonable for an out-of-
domain test. Intuitively, the baseline performance
should be crucial for the adaptation. As discussed
earlier the cache-based approach assumes correct
history and better baseline performance should in-
crease the chance of adding appropriate items to
the cache.
4.2 Applying the LM Cache
In our first experiment we applied a decaying uni-
gram cache in the language model. We performed
a simple linear search on a separate development
set for optimizing the interpolation weight which
gave as a value of ? = 0.001. The size of the cache
was set to 10,000 and the decay factor was set to
? = 0.0005 (according to our findings in figure
3). The results on our test data compared to the
standard model are illustrated (with white boxes)
in figure 4.
There is quite some variation in the effect of the
cache LM on our test documents. The translations
of most EMEA documents could be improved ac-
cording to BLEU scores, some of them substan-
tially, whereas others degraded slightly. Note that
the documents differ in size and some of them are
very short which makes it a bit difficult to interpret
and directly compare these scores. On average the
BLEU score is improved by 0.43 points per doc-
ument and 0.39 points per sentence. This might

be not as impressive as we were hoping for af-
ter the tremendous perplexity reduction presented
earlier. However, considering the simplicity of the
approach that does not require any additional re-
sources nor training it is still a valuable achieve-
ment.
4.3 Applying the TM Cache
In the next experiment we tested the effect of the
TM cache on translation quality. Using our hy-
pothesis of translation consistency we expected
another gain on our test set. In order to reduce
problems of noise we added two additional con-
straints: We only cache phrases that contain at
least one word longer than 4 characters (a simplis-
tic attempt to focus on content words rather than
function words) and we only cache translation op-
tions for which the transition costs (of adding this
option to the current hypothesis) in the global de-
coding model is larger than a given threshold (an
attempt to use some notion of confidence for the
current phrase pair; in our experiments we used a
log score of -4). Using this setup and applying the
phrase cache in decoding we obtained the results
illustrated with filled boxes in the figure 4 above.
Again, we can observe a varied outcome but
mostly improvements. The impact of the phrase
translation cache (with a size of 5,000 items) is not
as strong as for the language model cache which
might be due to the rather conservative settings
(? = 0.001, ? = 0.001) and the fact that matching
phrase pairs are less likely to appear than matching
target words. On average the gain is about 0.275
11
BLEU points per document (0.26 per sentence).
4.4 Combining the Cache Models
Finally, we applied both types of cache in one
common system using the same settings from the
individual runs. The differences to the baseline
model are shown in figure 5.

cache models vs. standard models
Figure 5: The BLEU score differences between a
standard model and a model with cache for both
TM and LM (sorted by BLEU score gain).
In most cases, applying the two types of cache
together has a positive effect on the final BLEU
score. Now, we see only a few documents with
a drop in translation performance. On average
the gain has increased to about 0.78 BLEU points
per document (0.74 per sentence) which is about
2.7% relative improvement compared to the base-
line (2.6% per sentence).
5 Discussion
Our experiments seem to suggest that caching
could be a way to improve translation quality on
a new domain. However, the differences are small
and the assumption that previous translation hy-
potheses are good enough to be cached is risky.
One obvious question is if the approach is ro-
bust enough to be helpful in general. If that is
the the case we should also see positive effects
on in-domain data where a cache model could ad-
just to topical shifts within that domain. In order
to test this ability we ran an experiment with the
2006 test data from the workshop on statistical ma-
chine translation (Koehn and Monz, 2006) using
the same models and settings as above. This re-
sulted in the following scores (lowercased BLEU):
BLEUbaseline = 32.46 (65.0/38.3/25.4/17.6, BP=0.999)
BLEUcache = 31.91 (65.1/38.1/25.1/17.3, BP=0.991)
Clearly, the cache models failed on this test even
though the difference between the two runs is not
large. There is a slight improvement in unigram
matches (first value in brackets) but a drop on
larger n-gram scores and also a stronger brevity
penalty (BP). This could be an effect of the sim-
plicity of the LM cache (a simple unigram model)
which may improve the choice of individual lexi-
cal items but without respecting contextual depen-
dencies.
One difference is that the in-domain data was
translated in one step without clearing the cache at
topical shifts. EMEA documents were translated
one by one with empty caches at the beginning. It
is now the question if proper initialization is es-
sential and if there is a correlation between docu-
ment length and the effect of caching. How much
data is actually needed to take advantage of cached
items and is there a point where a positive effect
degrades because of topical shifts within the docu-
ment? Let us, therefore, have a look at the relation
between document length and BLEU score gain in
our test collection (figure 6).

Concluding from this figure there does not seem
to be any correlation. The length of the document
does not seem to influence the outcome. What
else could be the reason for the different behaviour
among our test documents? One possibility is the
quality of baseline translations assuming that bet-
ter performance increases the chance of caching
correct translation hypotheses. Figure 7 plots the
BLEU score gains in comparison with the baseline
scores.
Again, no immediate correlation can be seen.

baseline BLEU
Figure 7: Correlation between baseline BLEU
scores and BLEU score gains with caching
The baseline performance does not seem to give
any clues for a possible success of caching. This
comes as a surprise as our intuitions suggested that
good baseline performance should be essential for
the adaptive approach.
Another reason for their success should be the
amount of repetition (especially among content
words) in the documents to be translated. An in-
dication for this can be given by type/token ratios
assuming that documents with lower ratios contain
a larger amount of repetitive text. Figure 8 plots
the type/token ratios of all test documents in com-
parison with the BLEU score gains obtained with
caching.

Once again there does not seem to be any obvi-
ous correlation. So far we could not identify any
particular property of documents that might help
to reliably predict the success of caching. The an-
swer is probably a combination of various factors.
Further experiments are needed to see the effect on
different data sets and document types.
Note that some results may also be an artifact
of the automatic evaluation metrics applied. Qual-
itative evaluations using manual inspection could
probably reveal important aspects of the caching
approach. However, tracing changes caused by
caching is rather difficult due to the interaction
with other factors in the global decoding process.
Some typical cases may still be identified. Fig-
ure 9 shows an example of a translation that has
been improved in the cached model by making the
translation more consistent (this is from a docu-
ment that actually got a lower BLEU score in the
end with caching).

Other improvements may not be recognized by au-
tomatic evaluation metrics and certain acceptable
differences may be penalized. Look, for instance,
at the examples in figure 10.
This is, of course, not a general claim that
cache-based translations are more effected by this
problem than, for example, the baseline system.
However, this could be a direction for further in-
vestigations to quantify these issues.
6 Conclusions
In this paper we presented adaptive language and
translation models that use an exponentially de-
caying cache. We applied these models to a do-
main adaptation task translating medical docu-
ments with a standard model trained on Europarl.
On average the dynamic adaptation approach led
to a gain of about 2.6% relative BLEU points per
sentence. The main advantage of this approach is
that it does not require any domain-specific train-

ing, tuning (assuming that interpolation weights
and other cache parameters can be fixed after some
initial experiments) nor the incorporation of any
other in-domain resources. Cache based adapta-
tion can directly be applied to any new domain
and similar gains should be possible. However, a
general conclusion cannot be drawn from our ini-
tial results presented in this paper. Further exper-
iments are required to verify these findings and to
explore the potentials of cache-based techniques.
The main obstacle is the invalid assumption that
initial translations are correct. The success of the
entire method crucially depends on this assump-
tion. Error propagation and the reinforcement of
wrong decisions is the largest risk. Therefore,
strategies to reduce noise in the cache are impor-
tant and can still be improved using better selec-
tion criteria. A possible strategy could be to iden-
tify simple cases in a first run that can be used
to reliably fill the cache and to use the full cache
model on the entire text in a second run. Another
idea for improvement is to attach weights to cache
entries according to the translation costs assigned
by the model. These weights could easily be incor-
porated into the cache scores returned for match-
ing items. In future, we would like to explore these
ideas and also possibilities to combine cache mod-
els with other types of adaptation techniques.
