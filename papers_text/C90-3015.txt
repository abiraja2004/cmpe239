Trans format iona l  g rammars  and  "synthes is -  
by - ru le"  Most current text-to-speech systems 
(e.g. Allen et al 1987; Hertz 1981~ 1982, forthcoming; 
Hertz et aL 1985) are, at heart, unconstrained string- 
based transformational grammars. Generally, text- 
to-speech programs are implemented as the compo- 
sition of three non-invertible mappings: 
1. grapheme to phoneme mapping (inverse spelling 
r ales + exceptions dictionary) 
2. phoneme to allophone mapping (pronunciation 
rules) 
3. allophone to parameter mapping (interpolation 
rules) 
\])'or example: 
ph\] %, pit 
\[p'\] ~-- /p /  ~-- sip 
\[p-\] e / spit 
allophones ~ phonemes ,--- graphemes 
h denotes trong release of breath (aspiration) 
' denotes light/weak aspiration 
- denotes no aspiration 
These mappings are usually defined using rules of 
the form A -+ B /U  D e.g. (1), usually called 
"context-sensitive", but which in fact define unre- 
stricted rewriting systems, since B may be the empty 
string (Gazdar 1.987). It should be recalled that "if 
all we can say about a grammar of a natural anguage 
is that it is an unrestricted rewriting system, we have 
said nothing of any interest" (Chomsky 1963:360). 
(1) p --, p-/s__ 
e lse  p --, ph/__V 
(where V is any vowel symbol) 
else p --~ p' 
Often, of course, grammars made with rules of this 
type may be (contingently) quite restricted. For in.- 
stance, if the rules apply in a fixed order without 
cyclicity, they may be compiled into a finite-state 
transducer (Johnson 1972). But in general there 
is no guarantee that a program which implements 
such a grammar will halt. This would be pretty 
disastrous in speech recognition, and is undesirable 
even in generation-based applications, such as text- 
to-speech. However, this has not prevented the at> 
pearance of a number of "linguistic rule compilers" 
such as Van Leenwen's (1987, 1989) and Hertz's sys.- 
gems. 
Tile basic operations of a transformational gram? 
mar - -  deletion, insertion, permutation, and copying 
- -  are apparently empirically instantiated by such 
well-established phonological phenemona s elision, 
epenthesis, metathesis, assimilation and coarticula- 
tion. 
Copying (i): Assimilation 
e.g. 1 ran \[hi 
ran quickly \[9 \] 
Rule: n -~O/  {k,g} 
\[0\] denotes back-of-tongue (velar) 
nasal closure 
e.g. 2 sandwich \[samwitJ'\] 
Rule: n -~ m/  {l),b,w etc.} 
79 
Copying (ii): Ooarticulation 
e.g. keep \[~_\] 
cool 
c rt \[k\] 
V 
Rules: k - ,  +k / - - i -back\ ]  
V 
v 
denotes advanced articulation + 
denotes lip-rounding 
denotes retracted articulation 
Insertion: Epenthesis 
e.g. mince \[mints\] 
pence \[pents\] 
Rule: ns --~ nts 
Deletion: Elision 
e.g. sandwich \[sanwitf\] 
Rule: nd --* n 
Permutation: Metathesis 
e.g. burnt \[brunt\] 
Rule: ur -+ ru 
The problems inherent in this approach are many: 
1. Deletion rules can make Context- 
Se,lsitive grammars undecidable. (Salomaa 
1973:83, Levelt 1976:243, Lapointe 1977:228, 
Berwick and Weinberg 1984:127) 
2. Non-monotonicity m~kes for computational 
complexity. 
3. There is no principled 1 way of limiting the do- 
main of rule application to specific linguistic do- 
mains, such as syllables. 
4. Using sequences as data-structures is really only 
plausible if all speech parameters change with 
nlore-or-less equal regularity.

Figure 1: Richer structure in phonological represen- 
tations 
In partial recognition of some of these problems, pho- 
nologists have been attemptiug to reconstruct the 
transformational component as the epiphenomenal 
result of several interacting eneral "constraints". 
Numerous uch "constraints" and ~principles" have 
been proposed, such as the Well-Formedness Con- 
dition (Goldsmith 1976 and several subsequent for- 
nmlations), the Obligatory Contour Principle (Leben 
1973), Cyclicity (Kaisse and Shaw 1985, Kiparsky 
1985), Structure-Preservation (Kiparsky 1985), the 
Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973) etc. While 
this line of research is in some respects conceptually 
cleaner than primitive transformational grammars, 
there has been no demonstration that a "principle'- 
based phonology is indeed more restrictive than 
primitive transformational phonology in any compu- 
rationally relevant dimension. 
A declarative model of speech For the last few 
years, I have been developing a "synthesis-by-rule" 
program which does not employ such string-to-string 
transformations (Coleman and Local 1987 forthcom- 
ing; Local 1989 forthcoming; Coleman 1989). 
The basic hypothesis of this (and related) research is 
that there is a trade-off between the richness of the 
rule component and the richness of the representa- 
tions (Anderson 1985). According to this hypothesis, 
the reason why transformational phonology needs to 
use transformations is because its data structure, 
strings, is too simple. Consequently, it ought to be 
possible to considerably simplify or even completely 
eliminate the transformational rule component by 
using more elaborate data structures than just well- 
ordered sequences of letters or feature-vectors. For 
instance if we use graphs {fig. 1) to represent phono- 
logical objects, then instead of copying, we can im-

:(ncorpora~ing richer data-structures allows many if 
not all rewriting rules to be abandoned, to the extent 
J~hat the transformational rewrite-rule mechanism 
can be ditched, along with the problems it brings. 
Consider how the "processes" discussed above can 
be given a declarative (or "configurational") analy- 
sis. 
Allophony can be regarded as the different interpre- 
tation of t:he same element in different structural con- 
~exts, rather than as involving several slightly differ- 
ent phonological objects instantiating each phoneme.

Assimilation can also be modelled non-destructively 
by unification (fig. 2). 
Coarticulation is simple to model if parametric pho- 
netic representations may be glued together in par- 
allel, rather than simply concatenated. Consonants 
may then overlaid over vowels, rather than simply 
concatenated to them (Ohman \]966, Perkell 1969, 
Gay 1977, Mattingly 1981, Fowler 1983). If required, 
~his analysis can also be implemented in the phono- 
logical component, using graphs of the 'overlap' re- 
lation (Griffen 1985, Bird and Klein 1990): e.g.: 
ii tiLl aa

minor variations in the temporal coordination of in- 
dependent parameters (Jespersen 1933:54, Anderson 
1976, Mohanan 1986, Browman and Goldstein 1986) 
(fig. 3). 
It has been demonstrated (Fourakis 1980, Kelly and 
Local 1989) that epenthetic elements are not phonet- 
ically identical to similar non-epenthetic elements. 
The transformational analysis, however, holds that 
the phonetic implementation f a segment is depen- 
dendent on its features, not its derivatonal history 
('% \[t\] is a It\] is a It\]'), and thus incorrectly predicts 
that an epenthetic \[t\] should be phonetically identi- 
ca.1 to any other It\]. 
Elision is the inverse of epenthesis, and is thus in 
some sense "the same" phenomenon, taking the "un- 
elided': form as more primitive than the "elided" 
form, a decision which is entirely meaningless in the 
declarative account (fig. 4) 
Metathesi3 is another instance of "the same" phe- 
nomenon i.e. different temporal synchronisation of
an invariant set of elements. Epenthesis, Elision and 
Metathesis may all be regarded as instances of the 
more general phenomenon ofnon-significant variabil- 
ity ill the timing of parallel events.

As well as these relatively low-level phonological 
phenomena, work in Metrical Phonology (Church 
1985) and Dependency Phonology (Anderson and 
Jones 1974) has shown how stress assignment, a
paradigm example for transformational phonology, 
can be given a declarative analysis. 
Overview of text - to -parameter  conversion in 
the YorkTalk system 
1. Each symbol in the input text string is trans- 
lated into a column-vector of distinctive pho- 
netic features (nasal, vowel, tongue-back, etc.) 
Sequences of letters are thus translated into se- 
quences of feature-structures. 
2. The sequence of feature-structures is parsed. 
This process translates the sequence into a 
directed graph representing the phonological 
constituent structure of the utterance. 
3. The phonological structure is traversed and an 
interpretation function applied at each node to 
derive a phonetic parameter matrix. 
Parsing is done using a Phrase Structure Grammar 
of phoneme strings. A very simplified version of such 
a grammar is fig. 5. I have implemented several such 
grammars o far, including a DCG implementation 
and a PATR-II-like implementation. With one or 
two simple extensions to the grammar formalism, it 
is also possible to parse re-entrant (e.g. ambisyllabic) 
structures and other overlapping structures, such as 
those arising from bracketting "paradoxes". The re- 
suiting graphs are thus not trees, but directed acyclic 
graphs. 
In computational syntactic theory, one of the main 
uses for the parse-tree of a string is to direct the 
construction of a compositional (Fregean) semantic 
interpretation, according to the rule-to-rule hypoth- 
esis (Bach 1976). In the YorkTalk system, the same 
approach is employed to assign a phonetic interpre- 
tation to the phonological representation. A sec- 
ond, theory-internal motivation for constructing rich 
parse-graphs of the phonemic string is that it enables 
the phoneme string to be discarded completely, thus 
liberating the phonetic interpretation function from 
the sequentiality and other undesirable properties of 
seglnental strings. 
After the phonological graph has been constructed 
by the parser, a head-first graph-traversal lgorithm 
maps the (partial) phonological category of each 
node into equations describing the time-dependent 
motion of the synthesis parameters for specified in- 
telwals of time. These parametric time-functions are 
finally instantiated with actual numbers represent- 
ing times, in order to derive a complete matrix of 
(parameter, value) pairs. 
As well as being computationally "clean", this 
method of synthesis has the additional merit of being 
genuinely non-segmental in (at least) two respects: 
there are no segments in the phonological representa- 
tions, and there is no cross-parametric segmentation 
in the phonetic representations. The resulting speech 
does not manifest the discontinuities and rapid cross- 
parametric hanges which often cause clicks, pops, 
and the other disfiuencies which typify some syn- 
thetic speech. On the contrary, the speech is fluent, 
articulate and very human-like. When the model 
is wrong in some respect, it sounds like a speaker 
of a different language or dialect, or someone with 
dysfluent speech. For all these reasons, the York- 
Talk model is attracting considerable interest in the 
speech technlogy industry and research commulfity, a 
circumstance which I hope will promote awidespread 
change of approach to computational phonology in 
future.
