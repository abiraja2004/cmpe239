Abstract
The recent proliferation of political and so-
cial forums has given rise to a wealth of freely
accessible naturalistic arguments. People can
?talk? to anyone they want, at any time, in
any location, about any topic. Here we use
a Mechanical Turk annotated corpus of forum
discussions as a gold standard for the recog-
nition of disagreement in online ideological
forums. We analyze the utility of meta-post
features, contextual features, dependency fea-
tures and word-based features for signaling
the disagreement relation. We show that us-
ing contextual and dialogic features we can
achieve accuracies up to 68% as compared to
a unigram baseline of 63%.
1 Introduction
The recent proliferation of political and social fo-
rums has given rise to a wealth of freely accessible
naturalistic arguments. People can ?talk? to anyone
they want, at any time, in any location, about any
topic. Their conversations range from current polit-
ical topics such as national health care to religious
questions such as the meaning of biblical passages.
See Figure 1. We aim to automatically derive rep-
resentations of the discourse structure of such argu-
ments and to gain a deeper theoretical and empirical
understanding of the linguistic reflexes of perlocu-
tionary acts such as persuasion (Austin, 1965).
The study of the structure of argumentative com-
munication has a long lineage in psychology (Cial-
dini, 2000) and rhetoric (Hunter, 1987), but the his-
torical lack of a large corpus of naturalistic exam-
Topic Q-R: Post
Evolution Q: How can you say such things? The Bible says that
God CREATED over and OVER and OVER again! And
you reject that and say that everything came about by
evolution? If you reject the literal account of the Cre-
ation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar! If you
cannot trust God?s Word from the first verse, how can
you know that the rest of it can be trusted?
R: It?s not a literal account unless you interpret it that
way.
Gay
mar-
riage
Q: Gavin Newsom- I expected more from him when I
supported him in the 2003 election. He showed himself
as a family-man/Catholic, but he ended up being the ex-
act oppisate, supporting abortion, and giving homosexu-
als marriage licenses. I love San Francisco, but I hate the
people. Sometimes, the people make me want to move
to Sacramento or DC to fix things up.
R: And what is wrong with giving homosexuals the right
to settle down with the person they love? What is it to
you if a few limp-wrists get married in San Francisco?
Homosexuals are people, too, who take out their garbage,
pay their taxes, go to work, take care of their dogs, and
what they do in their bedroom is none of your business.
Abortion Q: Equality is not defined by you or me. It is defined by
the Creator who created men.
R: Actually I think it is defined by the creator who cre-
ated all women. But in reality your opinion is gibberish.
Equality is, like every other word, defined by the people
who use the language. Currently it means ?the same?.
People aren?t equal because they are not all the same.
Any attempt to argue otherwise is a display of gross stu-
pidity.
Figure 1: Sample Quote/Response Pairs
ples has limited empirical work to a handful of gen-
res (e.g., editorials or simulated negotiations). Ar-
gumentation is above all tactical. Thus being able
to effectively model it would afford us a glimpse
of pragmatics beyond the conversational turn. More
practically, an increasing portion of information and
opinion exchange online occurs in natural dialogue,
in forums, in webpage comments, and in the back
2
and forth of short messages (e.g., Facebook status
updates, tweets, etc.) Effective models of argumen-
tative discourse thus have clear applications in auto-
matic summarization, information retrieval, or pre-
dicting real-world events such as how well a new
product is being received or the outcome of a popu-
lar vote on a topic (Bollen et al, 2011).
In this paper, we focus on an important initial task
for the recognition of argumentative structure: auto-
matic identification of agreement and disagreement.
We introduce the ARGUE corpus, an annotated col-
lection of 109,553 forum posts (11,216 discussion
threads) from the debate website 4forums.com. On
4forums, a person starts a discussion by posting a
topic or a question in a particular category, such as
society, politics, or religion. Some example topics
can be seen in Table 1. Forum participants can then
post their opinions, choosing whether to respond di-
rectly to a previous post or to the top level topic (start
a new thread). These discussions are essentially di-
alogic; however the affordances of the forum such
as asynchrony, and the ability to start a new thread
rather than continue an existing one, leads to dia-
logic structures that are different than other multi-
party informal conversations (Fox Tree, 2010). An
additional source of dialogic structure in these dis-
cussions, above and beyond the thread structure, is
the use of the quote mechanism, in which partici-
pants often break a previous post down into the com-
ponents of its argument and respond to each compo-
nent in turn. Many posts include quotations of previ-
ous posts. Because we hypothesize that these posts
are more targeted at a particular proposition that the
poster wants to comment on, than posts and replies
in general, we focus here on understanding the rela-
tionship between a quoted text and a response, and
the linguistic reflexes of those relationships. Exam-
ples of quote/response pairs for several of our topics
are provided in Figure 1.
The most similar work to our own is that of
Wang & Rose (2010) who analyzed Usenet fo-
rum quote/response structures. This work did not
distinguish agreement vs. disagreement across
quote/response pairs. Rather they show that they can
use a variant of LSA to improve accuracy for identi-
fying a parent post, given a response post, with 70%
accuracy. Other similar work uses Congressional
debate transcripts or blogs or other social media to
develop methods for distinguishing agreement from
disagreement or to distinguish rebuttals from out-of-
context posts (Thomas et al, 2006; Bansal et al,
2008; Awadallah et al, 2010; Walker et al, ; Bur-
foot, 2008; Mishne and Glance, 2006; Popescu and
Pennacchiotti, 2010). These methods are directly
applicable, but the genre of the language is so dif-
ferent from our informal forums that the results are
not directly comparable. Work by Somasundaran &
Wiebe (2009, 2010) has examined debate websites
and focused on automatically determining the stance
of a debate participant with respect to a particular is-
sue. This work has treated each post as a text to be
classified in terms of stance, for a particular topic,
and shown that discourse relations such as conces-
sions and the identification of argumentation triggers
improves performance . Their work, along with oth-
ers, also indicates that for such tasks it is difficult to
beat a unigram baseline (Pang and Lee, 2008). Other
work has focused on the social network structure
of online forums (Murakami and Raymond, 2010;
Agrawal et al, 2003). However, Agarwal?s work as-
sumed that adjacent posts always disagree, and did
not use any of the information in the text. Murakami
& Raymond (2010) show that simple rules defined
on the textual content of the post can improve over
Agarwal?s results.
Section 2 discusses our corpus in more detail, de-
scribes how we collected annotations using Mechan-
ical Turk, and presents results of a corpus analysis
of the use of particular discourse cues. Section 3 de-
scribes how we set up classification experiments for
distinguishing agreement from disagreement, and
Section 4 presents our results for agreement classifi-
cation. We also characterize the linguistic reflexes of
this relation. We analyze the utility of meta-post fea-
tures, contextual features, dependency features and
word-based features for signaling the disagreement
relation. We show that using contextual and dia-
logic features we can achieve accuracies up to 68%
as compared to a unigram baseline of 63%.

Our corpus is derived from a debate oriented in-
ternet forum called 4forums.com. It is a typical in-
ternet forum built on the vBulletin software. People
initiate discussions (threads) and respond to others?
posts. Each thread has a tree-like dialogue structure.
Each post has author information and a timestamp
with minute resolution. Many posts include quota-
tions of previous posts. For this work we chose to
focus on quotations because they establish a clear re-
lationship between the quoted text and the response.
Our corpus consists of 11,216 discussions and
109,553 posts by 2764 authors. We hand annotated
discussions for topic from a set of previously identi-
fied contentious political and social issues. The web-
site is tailored to a US audience and our topics are
somewhat US centric. Table 1 describes features of
our topics in order of decreasing discussion count.
When restricted to these topics, the corpus consists
of 2868 discussions, 33,089 posts, and 1302 authors.
Many posts include quotations. Overall 60,382
posts contain one or more quotation. Within our
topics of interest, nearly 20,000 posts contain quota-
tions. We defined a quote-response pair (Q-R pair)
where the response was the portion of the respond-
ing post directly following a quotation but preceding
any additional quotations.
We selected 10,003 Q-R pairs from the topics
of interest for a Mechanical Turk annotation task.
These were biased by cue word to ensure adequate
data for discourse marker analysis (See Section 2.1.
For this task we showed annotators seven Q-R pairs
and asked them to judge Agreement/Disagreement
and a set of other measures as shown in Figure 2.
Most of our measures were scalar; we chose to do
this because previous work on estimating the rela-
tionship between MTurk annotations and expert an-
notations suggest that taking the means of scalar
annotations could be a good way to reduce noise
in MTurk annotations (Snow et al, 2008). For all
of the measures annotated, the Turkers were not
given additional definitions of their meaning. For
example, we let Turkers to use their native intu-
itions about what it means for a post to be sarcas-
tic, since previous work suggests that non-specialists
tend to collapse all forms of verbal irony under the
term sarcastic (Bryant and Fox Tree, 2002). We
did not ask Turkers to distinguish between sarcasm
and other forms of verbal irony such as hyperbole,
understatement, rhetorical questions and jocularity
(Gibbs, 2000).
Agreement was a scalar judgment on an 11 point
scale [-5,5] implemented with a slider. The anno-
tators were also able to signal uncertainty with an
CAN?T TELL option. Each of the pairs was anno-
tated by 5-7 annotators. We showed the first 155
characters of each quote and each response. We also
provided a SHOW MORE button which expanded the
post to its full length. After annotation, we removed
a number of Q-R pairs in cases where a clear link
between the quote and a previous post could not be
established, e.g. the source quoted was not another
post, but the NY Times. This left us with 8,242 Q-R
pairs for our final analysis. Resampling to a natural
distribution left us with 2,847 pairs which we used
to build our machine learning test set. We used the
remaining annotated and unannotated pairs for de-
4
velopment.
Type ? Survey Question
S 0.62 Agree/Disagree: Does the respondent agree or dis-
agree with the prior post?
S 0.32 Fact/Emotion: Is the respondent attempting to
make a fact based argument or appealing to feel-
ings and emotions?
S 0.42 Attack/Insult: Is the respondent being support-
ive/respectful or are they attacking/insulting in
their writing?
B 0.22 Sarcasm: Is the respondent using sarcasm?
S 0.46 Nice/Nasty: Is the respondent attempting to be nice
or is their attitude fairly nasty?
Figure 2: Mechanical Turk Annotations (Binary = B and
Scalar = S) and level of agreement as Krippendorff?s ?.
Figure 3 provides examples from the end
points and means of the annotations for three
of the questions, Respect/Insult, Sarcasm, and
Fact/Emotion. Nice/Nasty and Respect/Insult are
strongly correlated by worker annotations r(54003)
= 0.84, p < 2.2e-16 and both weakly corre-
lated with Agree/Disagree ratings (r(54003) = 0.32
and r(54003)=0.36, respectively; p < 2.2e-16)
and Fact/Emotion ratings (r(54003) = 0.32 and
r(54003)=0.31, respectively; p < 2.2e-16), while
Agree/Disagree and Fact/Emotion ratings show the
smallest correlation, r(54003)=0.11, p < 2.2e-16.
For the linguistic marker correlations discussed be-
low we averaged scores across annotators, a process
which sharpened correlations (e.g., Respect/Insult
means correlate with Agree/Disagree means more
strongly (r(5393) = 0.51) as well as Nice/Nasty
means (r(5393) = 0.91; Agree/Disagree is far less
correlated with Fact/Emotion (r(5393) = 0.07). In-
terannotator agreement was computed using Krip-
pendorff?s ? (due to the variability in number of an-
notators that completed each hit), assuming an ordi-
nal scale for all measures except sarcasm; see Fig-
ure 2. The low agreement for Sarcasm accords with
native intuition ? it is the class with the least de-
pendence on lexicalization and the most subject to
inter-speaker stylistic variation. The relatively low
results for Fact/Emotion is perhaps due to the emo-
tional charge many ideological arguments engender;
informal examination of posts that showed the most
disagreement in this category often showed a cut-
ting comment or a snide remark at the end of a post,
which was was ignored by some annotators and ev-
idence for others (one Emotional post in Figure 3 is
clearly an insult, but was uniformly labeled as -5 by
all annotators).
2.1 Discourse Markers
Both psychological research on discourse processes
(Fox Tree and Schrock, 1999; Fox Tree and Schrock,
2002; Groen et al, 2010) and computational work
on agreement (Galley et al, 2004) indicate that dis-
course markers are strongly associated with partic-
ular pragmatic functions. Because of their salient
position, we test the role of turn-initial markers in
predicting upcoming content (Fox Tree and Schrock,
2002; Groen et al, 2010). Based on manual inspec-
tion of a subset of the corpus, we constructed a list of
20 discourse markers; 17 of these occurred at least
50 times in a quote response (upper bound of 700
samples): actually, and, because, but, I believe, I
know, I see, I think, just, no, oh, really, so, well,
yes, you know, you mean. All of their occurrences
became part of the 10,003 Q-R pairs annotated.
The top discourse markers highlighting disagree-
ment were really (67% read a response beginning
with this marker as prefacing a disagreement with
a prior post), no (66%), actually (60%), but (58%),
so (58%), and you mean (57%). At this point, the
next most disagreeable category was the unmarked
category, with about 50% of respondents interpret-
ing an unmarked post as disagreeing. On the other
hand, the most agreeable marker was yes (73% read
a response beginning with this marker as prefacing
an agreement) followed by I know (64%), I believe
(62%), I think (61%), and just (57%). The other
markers were close to the unmarked category: and
(50%), because (51%), oh (51%), I see (52%), you
know (54%), and well (55%).
The overall agreement on sarcasm was low, as in
other computational work on recognizing sarcasm
(Davidov et al, 2010). At most, only 31% of re-
spondents agreed that the material after a discourse
marker was sarcastic, with the most sarcastic mark-
ers being you mean (31%), oh (29%), really (24%),
so (22%), and I see (21%). Only 15% of respon-
dents rated the unmarked category as sarcastic (e.g.,
fewer than 1 out of 6 respondents). The cues I think
(10%), I believe (9%), and actually (10%) were the
least sarcastic markers.
Taken together, these ratings suggest that the cues
really, you mean, and so can be used to indicate both

disagreement and sarcasm. However, but, no, and
actually can be used for disagreement, but not sar-
casm. And I know (14% sarcastic, similar to None),
I believe, and I think can be used for non-sarcastic
agreement.
From informal analyses, we hypothesized that re-
ally and oh might indicate sarcasm. While we found
evidence supporting this for really, it was not the
case for oh. Instead, oh was used to indicate emo-
tion; it was the discourse marker with the highest
ratings of feeling over fact.
Despite the fact that it would seem that disagree-
ment would be positively correlated with sarcasm,
disagreement and sarcasm were not related. There
were two tests possible. One tested the percentage of
people who identified an item as disagreeing against
the percentage of people who identified it as sar-
casm, r(16) = -.27, p = .27 (tested on 17 discourse
markers plus the None category). The other tested
the degree of disagreement (from -5 to +5) against
the percentage of people who identified the post as
sarcastic, r(16) = -.33, p = .18.
However, we did observe relationships between
sarcasm and other variables. Two results support the
argument that sarcasm is emotional and personal.
The more sarcastic, the nastier (rather than nicer),
r(16) = .87, p < .001. In addition, the more sarcas-
tic, the more emotional (over factual) respondents
were judged to be, r(16) = .62, p = .006 Taken to-
gether, these analyses suggest that sarcasm is emo-
tional and personal, but not necessarily a sign of dis-
agreement.
3 Machine Learning Experimental Setup
For our experiments we used the Weka machine
learning toolkit. All results are from 10 fold cross-
validation on a balanced test set. Unless otherwise
mentioned, we used thresholds of 1 and -1 on the
mean agreement judgment to determine agreement
6
and disagreement respectively. We omitted those Q-
R pairs which were judged neutral (mean annotator
judgment in the (-1,1) range).
As described above, from the original 10,003 Q-
R pairs we applied certain constraints (notably re-
quirement that we be able to identify the originating
post) which left us with 8,242. We then resampled
to obtain a natural distribution leaving us with 2,847
pairs. Applying the (-1,1) threshold and balancing
the result yielded a test set of 682 Q-R pairs.
3.1 Classifiers
Our experiments used two simple classifiers: Naive-
Bayes and JRip. NaiveBayes makes a strict indepen-
dence assumption and can be swamped by the sheer
number of features we used, but it is a solid baseline
and does a decent job of suggesting which features
are more powerful. JRip is a rule based classifier
which produces a compact model suitable for hu-
man consumption and quick application. JRip is not
without its own limitations but, for our task, it shows
better results than NaiveBayes. The model it builds
uses only a handful of features.
3.2 Feature Extraction
Our aim was to develop features for the automatic
identification of agreement and disagreement that
would do well on the task and provide useful base-
lines for comparisons with previous and future work.
Features are grouped into sets as shown in Table 2
and discussed in more detail below.
Set Description/Examples
MetaPost Non-lexical features. E.g. posterid, time be-
tween posts, etc.
Unigrams,
Bigrams
Word and Word Pair frequencies
Cue Words Initial unigram, bigram, and trigram
Punctuation Collapsed into one of the following: ??, !!, ?!
LIWC LIWC measures and frequencies
Dependencies Dependencies derived from the Stanford
Parser.
Generalized De-
pendencies
Dependency features generalized with re-
spect to POS of the head word and opinion
polarity of both words.
Table 2: Feature Sets, Descriptions, and Examples
Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams. Results of pre-
vious work suggest that a unigram baseline can be
difficult to beat for certain types of debates (Walker
et al, ; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010). Thus we
derived both unigrams and bigrams as features. We
captured the final token as a feature by padding with
-nil- tokens when building the bigrams. See below
for comments on initial uni/bi/tri-grams.
MetaPost Info. Previous work suggested that
non-lexical features like poster ids and the time be-
tween posts might contain indicators of disagree-
ment. People on these forums get to know one an-
other and often enjoy repeatedly arguing with the
same person. In addition, we hypothesized that the
?heat? of a particular conversation could be corre-
lated with rapid-fire exchanges, as indicated by short
time periods between posts.
Thus these features involve structure outside of
the quote/response text. This includes author infor-
mation, time between posts, the log10 of the time
between posts, the number of other quotes in the
response, whether the quote responds to a post by
the response?s author, the percent of the quoted post
which is actually quoted, whether the quoted post is
by the same author as the response (there were only
an handful of these), whether the response mentions
the quote author by name, and whether the response
is longer than the quote.
The forum software effectively does this annota-
tion for us so there is no reason not to consider it as
a clue in our quest to understand and interpret online
dialogue.
Discourse Markers. Previous work on dialogue
analysis has repeatedly noted the discourse func-
tions of particular discourse markers, and our corpus
analysis above also suggests their use in this par-
ticular dataset (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Fox
Tree, 2010; Schiffrin, 1987; Di Eugenio et al, 1997;
Moser and Moore, 1995). However, because dis-
course markers can be stacked up Oh, so really we
decided to represent this feature as post initial uni-
grams, bigrams and trigrams.
Repeated Punctuation. Informal analyses of our
data suggested that repeated sequential use of partic-
ular types of punctuation such as !! and ?? did not
mean the same thing as simple counts or frequen-
cies of punctuation across a whole post. Thus we
developed distinct features for a subset of these rep-
etitions.
LIWC. We also derived features using the Lin-
guistics Inquiry Word Count tool (LIWC-2001)
(Pennebaker et al, 2001). LIWC classifies words
7
into 69 categories and counts how many words get
classified into each category. Some LIWC features
that we expect to be important are words per sen-
tence (WPS), pronominal forms, and positive and
negative emotion words.
Dependency and Generalized Dependency. We
used the Stanford parser to extract dependency fea-
tures for each quote and response (De Marneffe et
al., 2006; Klein and Manning, 2003). The depen-
dency parse for a given sentence is a set of triples,
composed of a grammatical relation and the pair
of words for which the grammatical relation holds
(reli, wj , wk), where reli is the dependency relation
among words wj and wk. The word wj is the HEAD
of the dependency relation.
Following (Joshi and Penstein-Rose?, 2009) we ex-
tracted generalized dependency features by leaving
one dependency element lexicalized and generaliz-
ing the other to part of speech. Joshi & Rose?s re-
sults suggested that this approach would work better
than either fully lexicalized or fully generalized de-
pendency features.
Opinion Dependencies. Somasundaran & Wiebe
(2009) introduce the concept of features that iden-
tify the TARGET of opinion words. Inspired by this
approach, we used the MPQA dictionary of opinion
words to select the subset of dependency and gen-
eralized dependency features in which those opin-
ion words appear. For these features we replace the
opinion words with their positive or negative polar-
ity equivalents.
Cosine Similarity. This feature is based on previ-
ous work on threading. We derive cosine-similarity
measure using tf-idf vectors where the document
frequency was derived from the entire topic re-
stricted corpus.
Annotations. We also add features represent-
ing information that we do not currently derive au-
tomatically, but which might be automatically de-
rived in future work based on annotations in the cor-
pus. These include the topic and Mechanical Turk
annotations for Fact/Emotion, Respect/Insult, Sar-
casm, and Nasty/Nice, which could reasonably be
expected to be recognized independently of Agree-
ment/Disagreement.

4 Results
Table 3 shows features which were selected for each
of our feature categories using a ?2 test for fea-
ture selection. These results vindicate our interest
in discourse markers as cues to argument structure,
as well as the importance of the generalized depen-
dency features and opinion target pairs (Wang and
Rose?, 2010; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009). Fig-
ure 4 shows a sample model learned using JRip.

sifiers and feature sets to those corresponding to par-

ticular hypotheses. We conducted five tests with
Bonferroni correction to .01 for a .05 level of sig-
nificance.
While we hypothesized that more sophisticated
linguistic features would improve over unigram fea-
tures alone, a paired t-test using the results in Table 4
indicate that there is no statistical difference be-
tween the performance of JRip using only response
local features (JRip,ResponseLocal), as compared to
the Unigram,UniCue features (t(9) = 2.18, p = .06).
However, a paired t-test using the results in
Table 4 indicate that there is a statistical dif-
ference between the performance of JRip using
local features from both the quote and the re-
sponse, (JRip,BothLocal) as compared to the Uni-
gram,UniCue features (t(9) = 3.94, p =.003). This
shows that the contextual features do matter, even
though (JRip,BothLocal) does not provide signifi-
cant improvements over (JRip,Response Local) (t(9)
= .92, p = .38).
In general, examination of the table suggests
that the JRip classifier performs better than Naive
Bayes. A paired t-test indicates that there is a sta-
tistical difference between the performance of JRip
using local features from both the quote and the
response, (JRip,BothLocal) (JRip,BothLocal) and
Naive Bayes using local features from both the quote
and the response, (NB,BothLocal) (t(9) = 3.43, p =
.007).
In addition, with an eye toward the future, we ex-
amined whether automatic recognition of sarcasm,
attack/insult, fact/feeling nice/nasty could possibly
improve results for recognizing disagreement. Us-
ing the human annotations as a proxy for automatic
results, we get classification accuracies of over 81%
(JRip,JustAnnotations). This suggests it might be
possible to improve results over our best current re-
sults (JRip,BothLocal) (t(9) = 6.09, p < .001).
Another interesting fact, is that despite its use in
previous work for threading, the cosine similarity
between the quote and response did not improve ac-
curacy for the classifiers we tested, over and above
the use of text-based contextual features. Further
investigation is required to draw conclusions about
this or similar metrics (LSA, PMI, etc.).
5 Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a new collection
of internet forum posts, the ARGUE corpus, col-
lected across a range of ideological topics, and con-
taining scalar Agreement/Disagreement annotations
over quote-response pairs within a post. We have
demonstrated that we can achieve a significant im-
provement over a unigram baseline agreement de-
tection system using features from both a response
and the quote being responded to.
Beyond agreement, the ARGUE corpus contains
finer-grained annotations for degrees of insult, nas-
tiness, and emotional appeal, as well as the pres-
ence of sarcasm. We have demonstrated that these
classes (especially insult and nastiness) correlate
with agreement. While the utility of these classes
as features for agreement detection is dependent on
how easily they are learned, in closing we note that
they also afford us a richer understanding of how ar-
gumentative conversation flows. In section 2.1.2, we
outlined how they can yield understanding of the po-
tential functions of a discourse particle within a par-
ticular post. They may as allow us to understand the
extent to which participants react in kind, rewarding
insult with insult or kindness in turn. In future work,
we hope to turn to these conversational dynamics.
In future work, it would be useful to
build a ternary classifier which labels
9
Agree/Disagree/Neutral, thus reflecting the true
distribution of these dialogue acts in the data.
Additionally, the proportion of agreeing utterances
varies widely across media so it may be desirable to
add an appropriate prior when adapting the model
to a new dataset.
