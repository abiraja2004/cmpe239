Abstract 
We describe the adaptation for Arabic of 
the grammar-based MedSLT medical 
speech system. The system supports simple 
medical diagnosis questions about head-
aches using vocabulary of 322 words. We 
show that the MedSLT architecture based 
on motivated general grammars produces 
very good results, with a limited effort. 
Based on the grammars for other languages 
covered by the system, it is in fact very 
easy to develop an Arabic grammar and to 
specialize it efficiently for the different 
system tasks. In this paper, we focus on 
generation. 
1 Introduction 
MedSLT is a medical speech translation system. It 
allows a doctor to ask diagnosis questions in medi-
cal subdomains, such as headaches, abdominal 
pain, etc, covering a wide range of questions that 
doctors generally ask their patients. The grammar-
based architecture, built using specialization from 
reusable general grammars, is designed to allow a 
rapid development of different domains and lan-
guages. Presently, it supports English, French, 
Japanese, Spanish and Catalan. This article focuses 
on the system development for Arabic.  
In general, translation in this context raises two 
specific questions: 1) how to achieve recognition 
quality that is good enough for translation, and 2) 
how to get translations to be as idiomatic as possi-
ble so they can be understood by the patient. For 
close languages and domains where accuracy is not 
very important (e.g. information requests), it may 
be possible to combine a statistical recognizer with 
a commercial translation system as it is often done 
in commercial tools such as SpokenTranslation 
(Seligman and Dillinger, 2006). However, for this 
specific application in a multilingual context, this 
solution is not applicable at all: even if perfect rec-
ognition were possible (which is far from being the 
case), current commercial tools for translating to 
Arabic do not guarantee good quality. The domain 
dealt with here contains, in fact, many structures 
specific to this type of oral dialogue that can not be 
handled by these systems. For example, all the 
doctor?s interactions with the MedSLT system 
consist of questions whose structures differ from 
one language to another, with each language hav-
ing its own constraints. Consequently, two types of 
errors occur in Arabic translation systems. Either 
they do not recognize the interrogative structure as 
in example (1), or they produce ungrammatical 
sentences by copying the original structure as in 
example (2):

(in turafiq suda?atik bi wasithat rhatha-
yan)  
?if you-accompany your headache-plur us-
ing nausea? 
 
Ellipsis is another problem for MT systems. 
Many elliptical structures cannot be translated 
without context. In example 3, the context is 
needed to guarantee adjective agreement.  
 
(3) Doctor: is the pain severe?  
 Trad: ? ? 0?  (MedSLT) 
(hal al alam chadid) 
?Q the pain severe? 
 
Doctor: moderate? 
 Trad:  45$3? 45$63? 45$23!?  
(muhtamala, muhtamalan, muhta-
mal) 
?moderate_fem_attributive_adj,  
moderate_vocalized-predicative_adj,  
moderate_attributive_adj?. 
 
It is also essential for rules of translation to be 
applied consistently. For instance, in MedSLT, 
onset is translated by the verb -7 (dhahara). In 
this context, the adjective sudden has to be trans-
lated by an adverb 9?, (fajatan) (example 4). This 
implies that the translation of the ellipsis in the 
second utterance needs to change syntactic cate-
gory too. We can wonder to what extent the word-
for-word translation of the elliptical sentence in (4) 
can be understood by the patient.  
 
4)  Doctor: was the onset of headaches sud-
den?  
 Trad:   9??;??7- ?, ?   (MedSLT) 
(hal dhahara al sudaa fajatan?) 
 (Q appear-past-3 the headache suddenly?) 
 
Doctor: acute? 
Trad: <=
5?   
(mufaji?) 
  (acute) 
 
In addition to that ellipsis can not always be 
translated by the same type of ellipsis. Arabic 
grammar (Amin, 1982) allows the use of elliptical 
structures in cases where there is a semantic link 
( -!> ) referring to the omitted part of the sentence 
otherwise the elliptical construction is ambiguous. 
In example (3), the use of an adjective alone pre-
sents an ambiguity introducing, therefore, a diffi-
culty in comprehension which can be problematic. 
Thus, it is necessary to resort to a more sophisti-
cated approach. We will describe, in the following 
part, the architecture on which MedSLT is based. 
Then, we will show how it has been adapted to 
Arabic. 
2 The Architecture 
MedSLT is a grammar-based medical speech trans-
lation system which uses the commercial Nuance 
speech recognition platform. It has two main fea-
tures (Bouillon et al, 2005). First, all the language 
models (for recognition, analysis, generation) are 
produced from linguistically motivated, general 
unification grammars using the Regulus platform 
(Rayner, et al, 2006). First, domain specific unifi-
cation grammars are created from the general 
grammar for the different domains of medical di-
agnosis through a trainable corpus-based automatic 
grammar specialization process. They are, next, 
compiled into Context Free Grammars (CFGs) in a 
format suitable for use with the Nuance speech 
42
recognition platform, and into a form needed for a 
variant of Semantic Head-driven generation (Shie-
ber et al, 1990). Therefore, the different grammars 
needed by the system under this approach are easy 
to build and maintain. 
This leads us to the second feature. Because 
grammar-based speech recognition only produces 
competitive results for the sentences covered by 
the grammar, the user will need to learn the cover-
age of the system. In order to assist in this, a help 
system is included in the system (Starlander et al, 
2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al, 2006). The help 
system suggests, after each user utterance, similar 
utterances covered by the grammar which can be 
taken as a model. In order to derive the help sen-
tences, the system performs, in parallel, a statistical 
recognition of the input speech. It then compares 
the recognition result using an N-gram based met-
ric, against a set of known correct in-coverage 
questions to extract the most similar ones. It is in 
that way that we introduce some of the robustness 
of the statistical systems in the controlled applica-
tion. 
Once the sentence recognized, the translation is 
interlingua-based. Regulus allows different types 
of source representations (Rayner, et al, 2006), but 
we have chosen to use the simplest one in order to 
facilitate the translation process. It is a flat seman-
tic structure built up by concatenation of word 
meanings. For instance, ? $ ?;?? < ??2+? (hal 
yachtaddou al soudaa inda al qalaq? ?Q aggra-
vate-3 the headache in the stress?) would be repre-
sented as follows: 
 
[[cause,qalaq],[event,yachtaddou], 
[prep_cause,inda],[symptom,soudaa], 
[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq], 
[voice,active]] 
 
The same formalism is used for the interlingua 
which is a standardized version of the most explicit 
source English representation. For example, the 
interlingua representation of the previous sentence 
corresponds to the following structure that can be 
paraphrased as follows: ? does the pain become 
worse when you experience anxiety??: 
 
[[sc,when],[clause, 
[[pronoun,you],  
[secondary_symptom,anxiety], 
[state,experience], 
[tense,present], 
[utterance_type,dcl], 
[voice,active]]],  
[event,become_worse],[symtom,headache], 
[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq], 
[voice,active]].  
 
Under this approach the translation process only 
involves mapping simple structures. This facilitates 
the process of translation and the resolution of di-
vergences. This process goes through five stages: 
1) source language analysis in order to extract 
source representation; 2) ellipsis resolution if nec-
essary; 3) mapping the source structure into the 
interlingua; 4) mapping the interlingua into the 
target structure and 5) generation of the target lan-
guage in accordance with its own grammar. 
We will show next the adequacy of this architec-
ture for translation in Arabic. On the basis of the 
grammars already implemented for some lan-
guages covered by the system (French, English, 
Spanish, Catalan), it is, in fact, easy to develop a 
general Arabic grammar that meets the constraints 
of the MedSLT project and to specialize it for the 
purposes of speech recognition and generation. 
This method produces very good results when 
compared to commercial systems. 
3 General MedSLT grammar for Arabic 
Writing unification grammars for speech presents 
two requirements. Since it has to be transformed 
into context?free grammar (CFG) for recognition, 
features must have a finite number of values, as 
limited as possible. In practice, this means that at-
tributes can not take complex values and the lexi-
calist approach used in LFG or HPSG cannot be 
applied here. For example, subcategorization is not 
represented with general rule schemata as in 
HPSG. Therefore, syntagmatic rules must be mul-
tiplied for each type of verb (transitive, intransi-
tive, etc.). Even if this first constraint results in a 
less elegant and more repetitive grammar, it is not 
a limitation to the development of grammars with 
the complexity required for such applications. 
The grammar is used to constrain the recogni-
tion process, so it needs to include all information 
that could improve recognition. For instance, 
evaluation has shown that the quality of recogni-
tion decreases considerably when selection restric-
tions are omitted (Rayner, et al, 2006). Thus, in 
practice, this means that all Regulus general 
grammars include many features for managing this 
43
type of constraint. For example, nouns are seman-
tically typed; verbal entries contain features to de-
termine the type of complements according to their 
subcategorization, etc. These types are difficult to 
define coherently for the general vocabulary but 
are not problematic when the domain is very con-
trolled and the vocabulary very limited. In addi-
tion, they do not have any effect on the whole 
structure of the general grammar since they come 
from specialized lexica of various domains. 
As with all Regulus grammars, the Arabic 
grammar and lexicon are bound by these two re-
strictions. At the present time, they cover only 
questions in relation to headaches. The vocabulary 
contains 322 different forms. Nouns are semanti-
cally typed and verbs specify the type of comple-
ments. For instance, the entry @-=? (ajrayta, 
?carry out?) indicates that the verb selects a subject 
which is an agent (subj_np_type=agent) and an 
object of thera type (therapeutic) 
(obj_np_type=thera): 
 
v:[sem=[[state,tajri],[tense,pass?]], 
   subcat=trans, agr=2/\sing/\masc, 
   vform=finite, subj_np_type=agent,  
   obj_np_type=thera] -->  
         @a('?', ajrayta). 
 
It is interesting to note that features and values 
are the same in Arabic as in other languages except 
for some differences such as the agr(eement) fea-
ture which can take a ?dual? value, inter alia. To 
avoid the multiplication of entries, particles such as 
?? (al), ? (bi), ? (ka), were separated from words to 
which they are normally attached. For recognition, 
this does not seem to pose a problem. For genera-
tion, they are joined to their heads according to 
specific orthography rules after the generation of 
sentences. Since the word is synthesized, it appears 
only in its non-vocalic form. 
The grammar contains 38 rules that describe 
yes-no questions introduced by ? (hal), for 
example : ?$? E? 3$ ? ? (hal yamtad al alam 
ila al katifayn, ?Q irradiate-3 the pain to the 
shoulders?) and some wh-questions, for example : 
?? -F E$5 (mata yadhar al alam, ?when appear-
3 the pain?). The grammar structure is, in the end, 
quite close to romance languages. As it can happen 
in Spanish or Catalan, the subject of yes-no 
questions in Arabic comes conventionally after the 
verb (hal yamtad [al alam]_sujet [?]) if not 
elided when it is agentive (hal [tahus] bi al alam 
[ 4*G ], ?Q you-feel with the pain?). Thus, we can 
the pain?). Thus, we can use similar rules applied 
to Prodrop and inversion in these languages. In-
version is not dealt with as a type of movement 
otherwise it would have obliged us to multiply the 
number of features in the grammar. Instead, we use 
the constituent vbar, which is also convenient for 
Arabic. We consider a yes-no question 
(yn_question) to be made up of a particle, which is 
? (hal), and a sentence (s) where the subject is 
either elided (inv=prodrop), or comes after the 
verb (inv=inverted), namely: 
 
yn_question:[sem=...] --> 
@a('?', hal), 
optional_adverb:[...], 
s:[...inv=inverted\/prodrop]. 
 
The s is rewritten in a vp which is itself consti-
tuted of a vbar and its complements according to 
the type of the verb (transitive, intransitive, etc.) as 
is a standard grammar structure: 
 
s:[sem=] --> 
vp:[inv=INV, ?]. 
 
vp:[sem=?, inv=INV, ?] --> 
vbar:[subcat=trans, inv=INV, ?.], 
optional_adverb:[?.], 
np:[?.], 
optional_adverb:[?], 
optional_pp:[?.], 
optional_adverb:[?.]. 
 
The vbar is itself composed of a single verb (if the 
subject is elided; in this case it has an 
inv=prodrop feature), or a verb followed by a sub-
ject (in such instance, it has a inv=inverted fea-
ture) as in rules shown above. We note that the 
elision will only be possible here if the verb takes a 
subject of agent type: 
 
vbar:[sem=?,inv=prodrop] --> 
optional_v:[agr=2/\masc/\sing, 
subj_np_type=agent]. 
 
 
 
vbar:[sem=..,inv=inverted] --> 
optional_v:[], 
np:[]. 
 
The treatment of wh-questions is more conven-
tional in all languages because it is not possible to 
handle them without simulating movement. We 
consider that the interrogative pronoun moved 
44
from its initial place (PP, etc.), which becomes 
empty, to an initial position (ayna_i tahus bi al 
alam [i], 
? G4* ?, ?where you-feel with the 
pain?). To deal with the movement, we use the 
standard mechanism of gap threading, introduced 
by Pereira (1981). The link between the empty 
constituent [i] and the constituent which has been 
moved (ayna_i in our example) is possible using 
two attributes which are gapsin and gapsout, in-
cluded in all categories related to the movement. 
For example, in the following rule, such attributes 
indicate that the interrogative element (wh_pp) is 
only possible if the sentence (s) contains an empty 
pp (indicated by the attribute gapsin=pp_gap): 
 
wh_question:[sem=...] --> 
wh_pp:[sem=..], 
s:[?, gapsin=pp_gap, gapsout=B]. 
 
In comparison with the rest of languages previ-
ously processed by the system, the Arabic gram-
mar does not have a lot of special cases. One rule 
specifies that some verb such as ?to be? (?
? 
(kana), ?( (yakun), with the feature sub-
cat=pred(icatif)) can be optional ? they can be re-
written in an empty constituent indicated as []: 
 
optional_v:  
[sem=[[state,be],[tense,present]],  
subcat=pred] --> []. 
 
Rules for numbers are also very complex in or-
der to represent the dual form in addition to the 
position of numbers which can change depending 
on whether the number is singular: one, for exam-
ple : more than one day 5 -%??H? ??(  (akthar min 
yawm wahid, ?more than day one?) and, the third 
day K
%?)? ? (al yawm al thalith, ?the day the 
third?), or plural, for example : more than 3 days, 
?
? !L6L 5 -%?? (akthar min thalathat ayam, ?more 
than three days?). 
4 Grammar specialization  
One of the most important advantages of the ap-
proach adopted here is that the general grammar 
can be specialized for use in different tasks and 
domains, to obtain a useful grammar in each case. 
In the case of Arabic, it is possible to perform gen-
eration and recognition directly using the general 
grammar described above, since it is not yet very 
elaborate. The general grammar is however already 
large enough to cause serious efficiency problems, 
When compiled for generation, the general gram-
mar overgenerates, as the target structures are flat 
and underspecified (they do not include, for exam-
ple, information on numbers or determiners, cf. 
examples above). It would be possible to insert 
preference rules to force the intended structure, but 
this solution is extremely unattractive from a soft-
ware engineering point of view. When compiling 
the grammar for recognition, the situation is even 
worse. All our experiments on other languages 
show that recognizers compiled from general 
grammars either perform very poorly (Bouillon et 
al 2007), or fail to recognize at all (Rayner et al
2006, section 11.7). As in previous work, we have 
attacked these problems by creating specialized 
versions of the general Arabic grammar. 
 
In our approach to grammar specialization, do-
main-specific unification grammars are derived 
from general ones using the Explanation Based 
Learning (EBL) technique (Rayner, et al, 2006). 
This corpus-based specialization process is param-
eterized by a training corpus and a set of opera-
tionality criteria. The training corpus, which can be 
relatively small, consists of examples of utterances 
that should be covered by the domain grammar. 
(For Arabic, the current training corpus is about 
450 sentences). The sentences of the corpus are 
parsed using the general grammar, then those 
parses are partitioned into phrases based on the 
operationality criteria. Each phrase defined by the 
operationality criteria is flattened, producing rules 
of a phrasal  grammar for the application domain. 
The resulting domain-specific grammar has a sub-
set of the coverage of the general grammar and 
reduced structural ambiguity. In a generation 
grammar, over-generation is virtually eliminated; 
specialized recognition grammars typically have 
greatly superior recognition due to the reduction in 
search space that they provide. In the case of the 
Arabic grammar described here, the training cor-
pus is a set of Arabic sentences based on the Eng-
lish reference corpus for the headaches domain. 
The operationality criteria are a slightly modified 
version of those used for the Romance grammars 
discussed in Bouillon et al, 2007.  
In previous work, we have described at length 
the structural relationships between general gram-
mars, and specialized grammars for recognition 
and generation; here, we will briefly summarize 
45
the main points and show a simple example of how 
they apply to our Arabic grammar. Figures (1) to 
(3) present parse trees for the sentence ?M? ? ?? 
(hal al alam daym ?Q the pain permanent?):

Figure (3): Parse tree for 'hal al alam daym' with 
the specialized generation grammar 
 
It is immediately apparent that (1), the parse tree 
for the general grammar, is structurally much more 
complex than (2) and (3), the trees for the special-
ized grammars. In particular, (1) has several nodes 
filled by optional modifiers of various kinds, all of 
which are here null; if this grammar is compiled 
into a recognizer, all these nodes result in extra 
paths in the search space, with a corresponding 
loss of efficiency. Both the specialized grammars 
flatten out the modifier structure, for example us-
ing learning a set of vp rules which instantiate 
only those combinations of modifiers that have 
actually been seen in the training corpus.  
The difference between the specialized recogni-
tion grammar (2) and the specialized generation 
grammar (3) is more subtle. The first thing to con-
sider is that the recognition version needs to con-
tain all the rules required for recognition and 
analysis of multiple syntactic variants of the diag-
nosis questions, while the generation one only has 
to contain sufficient rules to generate one variant 
(ideally, the most correct and idiomatic one) for 
each question. An important consequence of this 
general principle relates to the treatment of NPs. 
The general grammar includes a rule that forms an 
NP in a conventional manner from a specifier (id-
dat, koul and al, which has been separated from the 
noun), potentially optional, and a noun. This rule 
permits a compositional analysis of all the gram-
matical combinations of nouns and articles, which 
is also appropriate for the recognition grammar. 
For generation, however, the system learns gener-
ally complete (lexicalized) NPs, in order to attach 
the appropriate article for each noun on the basis of 
the corpus (there is an exception for NPs contain-
ing a number because it is obviously undesirable to 
include in the corpus one example of every num-
ber/noun combination). Contrasting (2) and (3), we 
see that in (2), the phrase ? (al alam, ?the pain?) 
is treated compositionally; in (3), it is a lexicalized 
phrase produced by the rule 
 
np --> ?        (al alam) 
 
Our previous experience with French, English and 
Spanish has shown that this method is a good solu-
tion for specialized and limited domains like the 
one under study. Articles are difficult to recognize 
(they are usually short unstressed words) and to 
translate, but the right combinations can easily be 
learnt according to the context and subdomain. In 
the next section, we show that the specialization 
method yields good results in practice when ap-
plied to Arabic.

5 Evaluation 
Our initial evaluation only tests the specialized 
Arabic generation grammar. We used an English 
corpus of 522 diagnostic questions gathered with 
MedSLT, which has previously been used to com-
pare linguistic and statistical recognition (Rayner 
et al, 2004). Translation were judged by four Ara-
bic translators from the Geneva Translation School 
on the following three-point scale: 
? Good : translation respects completely the 
meaning and the grammatical form; 
? OK : translation is not completely idio-
matic but understandable; 
? Bad : translation does not keep the mean-
ing, is non understandable or it is agram-
matical. 
The results are as follows:

We clearly can see that translations are good 
(Good or Ok) if the sentences are well recog-
nized/analyzed in English, which is very important 
for our application (381/408 for T1 (93%), 
381/408 for T2 (93%), 379/408 for T3 (92%), 
367/408 for T4, (89.9%)). Not analyzed sentences 
(21.8%) are those which are not covered by the 
English grammar but had to be reformulated in an 
existent structure with the help system (see above; 
Chatzichrisafis, et al, 2006).  
Three sentences only (0.6%) failed at the level 
of generation (Not generated sentences), which 
shows that the specialized generation grammar is 
robust enough for the domain. These sentences 
have now to be added in the corpus to be generated 
correctly. In other languages, we have indeed no-
ticed that this kind of error disappears after one or 
two cycles of evaluation on new data. Not trans-
lated sentences (4%) are mostly caused by spe-
cialized medical terms describing pain (pounding, 
throbbing, etc.) that we did not introduce yet be-
cause they need to be validated by Arabic medical 
specialists. Here are some examples of Good trans-
lations:

In order to compare our results with commercial 
MT systems output, we submitted the first 124 
well analyzed sentences to Systran. Among these 
translations, 98 were judged as Bad, 6 as Good 
and 20 as Ok. What the translator has considered 
as bad are the translations that are not in the inter-
rogative form and neither grammatical nor idio-
matic. Consequently they are not understandable. 
Here are the first ten translations we have obtained:

6 Conclusion 
At the present time, it would have been difficult to 
use a commercial machine translation system for 
Arabic in the context of our application where ac-
curacy is very important. One possibility is thus to 
use a more linguistic approach that takes advantage 
of the subdomain constraints. This approach is usu-
ally very costly. However we have shown in this 
paper that the MedSLT architecture based on mo-
tivated general grammars produces very good re-
sults, with a limited effort. The general grammar 
can be developed very easily on the basis of other 
languages. The experiments described here show 
good results for the Arabic generation grammar. 
Our initial anecdotal results with the Arabic recog-
nizer are promising, and we hope to begin evalua-
tion of this component in the near future.
