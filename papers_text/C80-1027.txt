LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE COMMUNICATION WITH COMPUTERS

Summary 
Interaction with computers in natural 
language requires a language that is flexible 
and suited to the task. This study of natural 
dialogue ~as undertaken to reveal those charac- 
teristics which can make computer English more 
natural. Experiments were made in three modes 
of communication: face-to-face, terminal-to- 
terminal and human-to-computer, involving over 
80 subjects, over 80,000 words and over 50 
hours. They showed some striking similarities, 
especially in sentence length and proportion of 
words in sentences. The three modes also share 
the use of fragments, typical of dialogue. 
Detailed statistical analysis and comparisons 
are given. The nature and relative frequency of 
fragments, which \]lave been classified into 
twelve categories, is shown in all modes. Spe- 
cial characteristics of the face-to-face mode 
are due largely to these fragments (which 
include phatlcs employed to keep the channel of 
communication open). Special characteristics of 
the computational mode include other fragments, 
namely definitions, which are absent from other 
modes. Inclusion of fragments in computational 
grammar is considered a major factor in improv- 
ing computer naturalness. 
The majority of experiments involved a real 
life task of loading Navy cargo ships. The 
peculiarities of face-to-face mode were similar 
in this task to results of earlier experiments 
involving another task. It was found that in 
task oriented situations the syntax of interac- 
tions is influenced in all modes by this context 
in the direction of simplification, resulting in 
short sentences (about 7 words long). Users 
seek to maximize efficiency In solving the prob- 
lem. When given a chance, in the computational 
mode, to utilize special devices facilitating 
the solution of the problem, they all resort to 
them. 
Analyses of the special characteristics of 
the computational mode, including the analysis 
of the subjects" errors, provide guidance for 
the improvement of the habitability of such sys- 
tems. The availability of the REL System, a 
high performance natural language system, made 
the experiments possible and meaningful. The 
indicated improvements in habitability are now 
being embodied in the POL (Problem Oriented 
Language) System, a successor to REL. 
I. Introduction 
The research reported on is part of a 
larger project aimed at improving the interac- 
tion of humans with computers in a language that 
is natural for the user. In real life applica- 
tions of computers the language is natural in a 
very specific sense, since it is constrained by 
the linguistic and situational context and sub- 
Ject to the inevitable restrictions of the com- 
putational grammar and the general requirements 
of this mode of interaction. However if compu- 
tational interaction is to be natural, forms of 
language which are natural in normal dialogue as 
well as those particularly suited to the appli- 
cation should be available to the user. A very 
important requirement is that the means of com- 
munication be flexible, that the user should be 
able to modify the language so as to best serve 
the solution of the problem. Another issue is 
to what extent the computer should act as a 
natural party to the Interaction. Naturalness 
of human-computer interaction is often refered 
to as a system's habitability. 
This research was undertaken upon the 
belief that investigation of human dialogue 
(both spoken and written) and analysis of 
human-computer interaction is essential to 
determine how good habitability can be achieved. 
Initial research was done on human-to-human 
dialogue, both in the face-to-face mode in 
totally free (but voice only) interaction and in 
the written mode where the dialogue was via com- 
puter terminals linked to a computer system, but 
where the interaction was in unrestricted 
English. Initial research involved the solution 
of a relatively simple though quite realistic 
problem. It confirmed some expected differences 
between the two modes of communication, but also 
revealed some surprising similarities. An 
extremely important result and one that proved 
particularly challenging to obtain was the iden- 
tification and definition of structures other 
than sentences used in natural unrestricted com- 
munication. These were finally reduced to about 
a dozen categories. The next stage of research 
involved a real-life task and the data was the 
same for three modes: face-to-face, terminal- 
to-terminal, and human-to-computer. Results for 
the first two modes were closely comparable to 
the previous results and were also compared with 
results from the computational mode. Again, 
what is more striking and worthy of interest are 
the similarities rather than the differences. 
Some of the major similarities are in sentence 
length, percentage of words in sentences (as 
against fragments), number of sentences (for 
termlnal-to-termlnal and human-computer mode), 
~ery high number of sentences containing be- 
verbs, and low number of sentences containing 
relative pronouns. 
In this paper, the focus is on (I) the com- 
parison of statistics obtained for the three 
- 190  
,nodes; (2) the nature and relative frequency of 
fragments and their implications for computa- 
tional habitability; and (3) detailed discussion 
of the characteristics of the computational 
interactions. 
The research involved over i00 subjects in 
years 1975, 1977 and 1979/80. The subjects were 
predominately undergraduate and graduate stu- 
dents at Caltech. This work resulted in an 
enormous amount of data, requiring a great deal 
of time for analysis. Since each protocol was 
scored by at least two people (and usually 
more), averaging out the scores was also time 
consuming. Total time spent by subjects in 
experiments was over 50 hours, which yielded for 
flnal comparisons 20 face-to-face protocols, II 
termlnal-to-terminal, and 21 human-to-computer, 
containing over 80,000 words. Protocols of over 
20 subjects in face-to-face and terminal-to- 
terminal mode were analyzed for categories and 
partial statistics~ and thus not included in the 
final results. 
The main thesis of this paper is that in 
problem solving situations ordinary conversation 
and human-computer conversation in a system that 
allows relative natural language, share several 
important features, and that we can improve com- 
puter habitability by learning about the nature 
of ordinary conversation, which exhibits rather 
well defined and identifiable structural pat- 
terns. 
II. Early Experiments 
In an interesting paper on natural human 
dialogue in a problem solving situation I, it was 
noted on the basis of extensive experiments that 
"people do not naturally speak in sentences" and 
that in general great unruliness characterizes 
interactive communication, whether spoken or 
written. At first sight of the protocols, one 
tends to confirm the impression. But a closer 
look both at the same protocols and at the 
results of analysis cited, as well as some 
informal observation of other conversations, and 
the reflection that communication would hardly 
be achievable in such an absence of rules, led 
me to a hypothesis that there is considerable 
order in natural conversation. I designed 
experiments in the summer of 1975 and they were 
conducted in the fall with the assistance of 
students in a course in Soelolinguistics at Cal- 
tech. Additional experiments were conducted in 
1977. These experiments are discussed in some 
detail since they provided guidelines for future 
research. They differ from the later experi- 
ments in the fact that subjects used as much 
time as was needed for the solution of the 
experiment, while in the later ones an arbitrary 
cut-off was imposed. The problem was that of 
locating the nearest doctor to a patient's 
address, given a map of Pasadena and a selected 
llst of  doctors. Each experiment involved two 
subjects, one being given the map of Pasadena 
with the patient's address marked on it (3 
different locations were used, but only one in a 
given experiment) and the other the list of doc- 
tors. In the face-to-face mode, the conversa- 
tions were tape-recorded and transcribed. Sub- 
Jects were free to communicate by voice but were 
not allowed to look at each others" materials. 
Typically, they were seated at the ends of a 
fairly large table with the tape-recorder 
between them, and the experimentor in the room. 
The experimentor provided the materials and 
instructions, and answered some initial ques- 
tions only. In tile terminal- to-terminal mode~ 
the subjects were in separate rooms and the pro- 
tocols were recorded and merged with a computer 
program. The subjects were free to communicate 
in ordinary English but had to observe some 
minimal typographical conventions (such as send- 
ing the message in by using two keys simultane- 
ously). The role of the experimentor was the 
same, but divided between the subjects and occa- 
sionally offering assistance with computational 
requirements. The subjects were fully aware 
that they were conversing with a human counter- 
part (in this, these experiments differed from 
Bill Martin's. 2 For the purposes of this paper, 
the results of 12 face-to-face experiments and 7 
termlnal-to-terminal are used. 
The problems of analysis were severe, but 
the results gratifying. As noted by other 
investigators, conversational English has a 
great deal of characteristics which call for an 
approach very different from the analysis of 
well formed single sentences. What is obvious 
is that there are many strings which are not 
sentences but "incomplete" or "unfinished" or 
ungrammatical in a variety of ways. But the 
difficulty of even deciding what a sentence is 
has also been noted (3) :  "...the sentence is 
not, strictly speaking, a unit in oral 
discourse. One can see texts \[n which long 
sequences of clauses linked by "and then..." 
occur. Are these separate sentences or one sen- 
tence?" After considerable reflection and 
search for guidance from the literature, a 
rather conventional notion of sentence was used, 
with the requirement that it contain a NP and a 
gP and that it be within the confines of a sin- 
gle message (a message being the utterance(s) of 
one speaker). Semantic considerations (admit- 
tedly often inevitably intuitive) were used to 
determine single or multiple sentencehood. 
Coordinating conjunctions and sequences such as 
"and then", pauses or phatic units (these being 
defined as any strings keeping the channels of 
communication open) often signalled separate 
sentences. Words such as "because" or "if" tied 
strings into a single sentence. An additional 
semantic requirement (again admittedly vague) 
was that a sentence could stand alone as a unit 
and make sense. These criteria worked quite 
well as evidenced by the counts made by dif- 
ferent scorers of the same protocols. 
An interesting category of sentences that 
emerged were the so-called transposed sentences, 
e.g., "The two small streets there might be 
-191 
doctors on."p "Conwire, I also hate.", "4, is 
it?", "That's the tallest thing we got, special 
weapon?", "Length by width, does it matter?". 
Although they are infrequent, such sentences 
contribute considerably to the distinctive 
impression made by ordinary conversation. Due 
to their low frequency, only a partial analysis 
of these was made. (In four protocols, they 
amounted to about 2.5% of the total of sen- 
tences.) The first three examples above show 
only word rearrangement, but the others contain 
pronouns substituting for the transposed NP, in 
one case preceding the NP, in the other follow- 
ing it. 
Some problems were encountered in the con- 
sideration of what was a word in numbers, abbre- 
viat ions, alphanumeric strings ? In general 
numbers and abbreviations were considered one 
word; in alphanumeric strings, a number was one 
word, and a character string another. Phaties 
such as "uh", "urn", "uhuh", as well as "okay", 
even when abbreviated to "O.K.", were considered 
one word, and as multiple words when obviously 
so, as in "you know", "I see". Differences in 
exact word counts were not large enough to be 
significant, and often coincided surprisingly 
well ? 
The most severe problem was, naturally, the 
definition of fragments. Even though a fairly 
clear classification was formulated at the end 
of the analysis of the 1977 experiments, frag- 
ments and phatics are discussed in conjunction 
with the 1979/80 results. Their definition was 
refined and some categories were reformulated, 
and comparisons are made with computational pro- 
tocols. The role and desirability of these 
fragments in natural conversation is also dis- 
cussed then. 
The most significant results of the early exper- 
iments are summed up in Table I.

\[II. Three Modes of Communication: 
A Comparison 
i. The Experimental Setting 
The setting in the 1979/80 experiments in the 
F-F and T-T modes was similar to that described 
in Section II, but with major differences in the 
overall design of the experiments. First, three 
modes of communication were used, the third 
being human-to-computer. The task was a real 
life task of loading cargo onto a ship, the data 
being from the real environment of loading U.S. 
Navy ships by a group located in San Diego, Cal- 
ifornia. In the first two modes, one subject 
was provided with a list of cargo items to be 
loaded (along with their quantities) and a llst 
of decks, their sizes, and their primary uses. 
The other subject was given a list of the sizes 
of the cargo items. The subjects were 
instructed to obey space and other limitations 
(e.g., hatch size) and restrictions as to what 
cargo could be stowed on what decks. There was 
a time limit of one hour in both modes. The 
task of transcribing F-F recordings was very 
laborious due primarily to the specific Jargon 
and numerous abbreviations in the data. In the 
T-T mode, the protocols were obtained automati- 
cally. 
For the human-computer mode, the REL System 
was used. 4-6 This system, developed by our pro- 
Ject, provides the means for communicating with 
a large data base in a limited but useful style 
of natural English, described in detail in. 6 
The response times to user queries are quite 
reasonably short so that natural interaction is 
possible. Requests which are not understood are 
diagnosed extremely quickly, thus encouraging 
the user to try alternate ways of phrasing. 
This technique was indeed employed frequently, 
as discussed in Section IV. 
It has always been the REL System's philo- 
sophy that naturalnesss of a language is 
obtained in two primary ways: task-specificity 
and flexibility for modifications. Task- 
specifity can be achieved only by actual study 
of the users" needs (and, obviously, by incor- 
porating their data in the system). The capa- 
bilities of REL English have already been 
extended to make the language more natural for 
this specific task, notably by developing a 
192 
prompting "load sequence" (and "offload 
sequence") in which the computer elicits the 
information from the user, and offers clarifica- 
tion if the prompt is not clear. This device 
was used extensively by the subjects, but its 
description is left out due to space limita- 
tions. 
The other major ingredient of naturalness 
is enabling the user to suit the language to the 
task by incorporating his specific knowledge and 
jargon. To do this, the user must be able to 
extend the language through definitions and make 
other modifications. This, also, was done by 
the subjects and is discussed in Section IV. 
The experimental setting was obviously very dif- 
ferent. One subject at a time was assigned the 
task. No precise time limit was set, but most 
subjects were given two hour time slots, some of 
which was spent in in\[tiallzing the computa- 
tional session. The subject's session on the 
average lasted one and a half hours. The sub- 
jects were given a llst of the cargo items to be 
loaded and the number of each, as well as the 
primary uses of the decks. They were instructed 
that they should attend to fitting the cargo 
through hatch sizes and to keep track of space 
loaded. All the pertinent data about the cargo 
and ships was in the computer. The subjects 
were also given a short manual on the loading of 
ships, with examples of how to use the system 
and English, including arithmetic, definitions 
and load sequences. The experimenter helped the 
subject get started and assisted in case of com- 
putational problems in about half of the cases, 
others working alone. Although the subjects 
were instructed to read the manual before com- 
mencing experiments, the analysis of protocols 
showed that few had actually familiarized them- 
selves with the system. 
2. The Structure of Face-to-Face Dialogues 
Some working definitions need to be stated here. 
Messages and sentences were discussed in Section 
II. Fragments are all of the dialogue material 
that is not in sentences, and Phatics, which 
constitute a big subgroup of fragments, are all 
strings which serve a variety of functions which 
may all be characterized as keeping the channel 
of communication open (including expressions of 
emotions to the other subject and the computer). 
A page from a dialogue in Figure 1 illus- 
trates some of the problems in analysis, and 
gives an idea of some of the categories of frag- 
ments, since it contains a rather large number 
of them. The categories are defined after the 
discussion of the page. Abbreviations are: 
S = sentence 
P = phatic 
C = connector 
TR = terse reply 
FS = false start 
E = echo 
ADD = added information 
SELF = talking to oneself 
TQ = terse question 
TI = terse information 
INT = interrupted 
TRUN = truncated 
TRANS = transposed sentence (discussed in 
Section II) 
FIGURE 1 
1 A There are like five categories right 
there. Ammunition, pyrotechnics, special 
weapons, vehicles and things on pallets. 
\[ADD\] 
2 B Yes, let's run through this llst here. 
\[P\] 
3 A Okay. \[P\] 
4 B CHG demo. \[TQ/TI\] 
5 A CHG. Okay, I have one CHG demo here on 
page 2. \[E,P\] 
6 B And that page consists of? \[C,TQ\] 
7 A It's a 32... \[INT/TRUN\] 
8 B I, I Just want to, want to know ~at  
type. \[FS\] 
9 A Oh, that's an ammunition. \[P\] 
i0 B It's an ammunition. \[E\] 
\[i A Yeah. \[P/TR\] 
12 B Uh hum, and some conwire? \[P, C, TQ\] 
13 A Conwire, I also have. That's... That's a 
pallet. You want a subclasslfication, or 
is that good enough? \[TRANS, FS\] 
14 B No, no, pallet's fine. \ [TR, TR\] 
15 A Okay. \[P\] 
\[6 B A CTG. \[TQ/TI\] 
17 A CTG is more than I. 
\[8 B Oh, Okay. 105 SMK. iF, P, TI\] 
19 A Is that a CTG 105 SMK? 
20 B It is indeed. 
21 A Okay. 2 pages of CTGs. CTG 105 ... SMK? 
\[P, SELF, TQ\] 
22 B Yeah \[TR\] 
23 A SMK, that's a pyrotechnic. \[TRANS\] 
24 B Okay, and 105 WP. \[PC, TQ\] 
25 A 105 WP. \[E\] 
26 B A CTG 105 WP. \[ADD\] 
27 A Let's see. An APE or HE? Would it help 
if I read this to you? \[P, TQ\] 
28 B Alright, makes sense in certain ways. 
\[rR\] 
29 A There's the WP, I'm sorry. It's in 
pyrotechnic also. \[P\]\] 
30 B Okay. \[P\] 
31 A I can tell you what's in ammunition if 
that would help. We've got a CTG 106 APE. 
32 B Okay. \[P\] 
33 A CTG 105 HE. \[TI\] 
34 B I or 2? \[TQ\] 
35 A Both. Both I and 2. Then also in 
ammunition I have a CTG 40HE and a 60HE. 
\[TR, ADD, C, TRANS\] 
36 B A 60HE. \[E\] 
37 A Yeah. It seems to be a 60HE. \[P\] 
M(essage) I is S(entence), 7 words long. 
The rest is ADD(ed information). B's first mes~ 
sage contains a P(hatic) and S of 6. M3 is a P. 
M4 is either a T(erse) Q(uestion) or T(erse) 
l(nformatlon). Next we have an E(cho), followed 
by a P and a S of 9. M6 is C(onnector) and TQ. 
M7 is either INT(errupted) or TRUN(cated). M8 
contains a F(alse) S(tart) and a S of 6. M9 is 
a P and an S of 3. MI0 is a S of 3, however on 
193 
semantic grounds it could be considered an echo. 
The rule was adopted that a sentence echo was 
considered a sentence. MII is either P or 
T(erse) R(eply), more likely the former, but the 
analysis in general would not be greatly 
affected by either choice. Mi2 starts with one 
or two Ps, more likely two, has a C and TQ. MI3 
is a TRANS(posed sentence), followed by FS and S 
of 3. Next we have either a S of 8, or two Ss, 
one of 3 and one of 4 and a C. Such sentences 
are fortunately infrequent. The general ten- 
dency was to separate such sequences unless 
semantic ties were strong. Again the influence 
on the overall analysis would not be great. Mi4 
contains two TRs or a TR and a P, and a S of 3. 
Next line is a P. M16 is again either TQ or TI. 
Next is a S of 5. Next llne ls two Ps and TI, 
next two are Ss of 6 and 3 respectively, 
although the latter could be considered a 
phatic. M2I is a P followed by SELF(talklng to 
oneself) and a TQ. Next is a TR. Next line is 
a TRANS. M24 is a P, C and TQ, next line is E. 
M26 is ADD. M27 is a P, a TQ, followed by a S 
of 9. Next a TR and a S of 5. It is prob- 
lematic whether this should be a S. There are a 
number of possibilities. It could be P, could 
be ADD. Not many such decisions fortunately had 
to be made. The presence of the verb and the 
idiomatic character weighed toward sentencehood 
Ln this case. M29 is a ~ of 3, a P, a S of 4. 
M30 is P. M31 is a S of II, followed by a S of 
6. The former is typical of complex sentences 
with strong semantic ties. Next M is P, next  
TI, next TQ, next TR, ADD, C and TRANS of 13. 
Next is E, and the last one a P followed by a S 
of 7. 
The working definitions for fragments and 
phatlcs are: 
TQ (Terse Questlon): An elliptical question 
usually containing no VP, hut often having a NP, 
e.g., "Why?", "How about pyrotechnics?" ("How 
about NP?" is quite common), "~lich ones?". 
TR (Terse Reply): An elliptical reply, also 
often Just a NP, e.g. , "No.", "Probably 
meters.", "50 and 7.62.". 
TI (Terse Information): A rather elusive 
category, neither question, reply nor command, 
an elliptical statement but one often requiring 
an action. Examples can be appreciated in con- 
text only (Figure i). It brings to mind 
Austin's How to Do Things with Words. 9 
E (Echo): An exact or partial repetition of 
usually the other speaker's string. Often an 
NP, but it may be an elliptical structure of 
various forms. A distinction was made at an 
earlier time between echo, self-echo, and echo- 
question but was abandoned. Only fragmentary 
echos (rather than whole sentences, which were 
far less common) were included. 
ADD (Added Information): An elliptical struc- 
ture, often NP, used to clarify or complete a 
previous utterance, often one's own, e.g., "It 
doesn't say anything here about weight, or 
breaking things down. Except for the crush- 
ables.", "It's smaller. 36"X20"XiT".". 
Spe\[llng out words was included here. 
~UN (Truncated): An incomplete utterance, 
voluntarily abandoned. 
INT (Interrupted): One involuntarily abandoned. 
These two are often hard to distinguish, but 
truncation is clear if the speaker abandons his 
utterance, e.g., "Uh, some of these are ... I 
don't know ~lat category they wlll go in.", and 
interruption is clear when one speaker Jumps 
over the other's utterance which shows signs of 
intent at continuation, e.g., "A: Maybe we 
should work on some of the bigger things. B: 
Yeah, I think that A: Let's try some of the 
bigger decks . . . .  ". 
FS (False Start): These are also abandoned 
utterances, but immediately followed by usually 
syntactically and semantically related ones, 
e.g., "They may, they may be identical 
classes.", "Well, the height, the next largest 
height l've got is 34.". 
COMP (Completion): Completion of the other 
speaker's utterance, distinguished from interr- 
uption by the cooperative nature of the utter- 
ance, e.g., "A: l've got a lot of...l 've got 
B: 2 pages. A: Yeah.". 
CORR (Correction): This may be done by either 
speaker. If done by the same speaker it is 
related to false start, but semantic considera- 
tions suggest a correction, e.g., "Those are 30, 
uh, 48 length by 40 width by 14 height.". 
SELF (Talking to Oneself): Fragments, sometimes 
mutterings, even to the point of undecipherabil- 
\[ty, not intended for the other person, but 
rather thinking aloud reminiscent of Piaget's 
"collective monologue", I0 e.g., "Ummm - 7 7 8 5 
and 14 - 7 7 8 will certainly add up to 22 
wouldn't it or I guess.". 
P (~hatics): The largest subgroup of fragments 
whose name is borrowed from Mallnowskl's II term 
"phat\[c communion" with which he referred to 
those vocal utterances that serve to establish 
social relations rather than the direct purpose 
of communication. This term has been broadened 
to include all fragments which help keep the 
channel of communication open, such as "Well", 
"Wait", but even "You turkey". Two sub- 
categories of phatics are: 
C (Dialozue connectors): Words such as "Then", 
"And", "Because" (at the beginning of a message 
or utterance). 
T (Tag questions): e.g., "They're all under 60, 
aren't they?" 
In the discussion above, the words 
"speaker" and "utterance" were used; but since 
most of these fragments are found also in the 
termlnal-to-termlnal mode and some also in the 
computatlonal mode, they apply also to typed 
interactions. 
3. Statistical Analysis of the Three Modes 
The analysis beta Is based on the 1979/80 exper- 
iments only since they all involve the same shi- 
ploading task. The results were scored in each 
case by at least two persons, and the computa- 
tional mode protocols by five. There are 8 
194  
face-to-face, 4 terminal-to-termlnal and 21 
human-to-computer protocols, involving 44 sub- 
Jects. The time, was one hour each for the 
first two modes, and an average of one and one 
half hours for the third. Since there were 
twice as many F-F protocols as T-T and almost 
twice as many H-C as the first two combined, 
statistical totals are not very important. They 
are given here however to yield strength to the 
final processed comparisons. 
The analysis of computational protocols 
clearly necessitated some different methodolo- 
gies, and some data is simply not comparable 
(e.g., load sequences, since they were absent in 
F-F and T-T). The category "message" was split 
into "parsed message" and "parsed and nonparsed 
message," the first comprised of parsed inputs 
and the second of all inputs. The fragments 
also consisted of parsed ones: terse question, 
terse reply and definitions, and nonparsed ones: 
false starts and phatics. The terms "message" 
and "fragment" for the values in H-C refer to 
parsed messages and parsed fragments. Unless 
indicated otherwise, "fragments" in general do 
not include phatics, connectors and tags. Load 
sequences were completely left out of analysis, 
and obviously no computer answers were analyzed.

The statistics show some expected marked 
differences as to the number of words, messages, 
sentences, fragments and phatics. The face-to- 
face mode is not surprisingly much more verbose, 
and shows a much higher ratio of phatics. What 
is however far more interesting is that several 
statistics are close to each other: those for 
sentence length, message length, fragment length 
(excluding deflnitions in H-C, since they are 
absent in the other two), percentage o~ words in 
sentences, especially for F-F and T-T, percen- 
tage of words in fragments, again especially for 
F-F and T-T. The latter two are of interest 
since in the H-C mode the percentage of words in 
sentences is higher and in fragments is lower, 
even though the system allows use of fragments. 
As for sentence length, Chafe I0 cites the "idea 
unit" in spoken as having a mean length of ~out  
6 words. These numbers bring to mind George 
Miller's 12 "magical number 7". Also noticeable 
is a striking closeness between average of mes- 
sages in T-T and parsed and nonparsed inputs in 
H-C. The ratio of sentence/message are close 
for the 3 modes, and the ratios of 
fragment/message are close for F-F and T-T. Nor 
surprisingly, the ratio of phatic/message are 
different, being particularly low for H-C. 
Fragments are of particular interest and 
therefore are analysed in further detail. Frag- 
ments are considered separate from phatics. 
Nonparsed fragments in H-C are included in this 
analysis. TRUN and INT are collapsed into TRUN. 
As Table 4 shows TR is the predominant fragment 
in all three modes. (H-C mode characteristics 
are discussed in Section IV.) The next is ECHO 
for F-F, TI for T-T and TQ for H-C, and TQ is 
rather high in all three modes. These may seem 
to have little in common, but they are all typi- 
caly NPs. The percentages for FS are close in 
all three modes, particularly so in F-F and H-C. 
The absence of some categories in some modes is 
equally interesting, even though totally under- 
standable in some cases. The low presence of 
CORR in F-F and its absence in T-T is suprising, 
but may be partly due to some overlap of this 
category with FS. The absence of SELF and TAG 
in T-T and H-C is understandable, as is the 
absence of DEF(definltions) in F-F and T-T. It 
should be noted that in T-T the category did 
occur in a way. The subjects used a good deal 
of abbreviation in spelling (a common type of 
DEF is abbreviation) and also conventions, which 
every pair invented for end of message signal. 
ECHO and COMP in H-C would be rather silly -- 
who would echo or complete the computec? But 
the absence of ADD, CORR, TI and CON is due to 
the restraints of the grammar. Their role and 
desirability in H-C is further discussed in Sec- 
tion V.

Phat\[cs deserve a separate detailed discus- 
sion on account of their varied semantic func- 
tions but it is beyond the bounds of this paper. 
By faro the most common phatic is Okay. It is 
interesting that speakers do not seem to be 
aware of this. When I asked my class in psycho- 
linguistics (over 15 students) which phatlc they 
thought most frequent, a variety of answers was 
given, but none came up with Okay. Table 5 
shows the percentages of the top 5 phatics. In 
H-C several phatlcs occurred, but only 3 "Okay"s 
and one "Oh well" of the tope five. They are 
illustrated below and discussed in Sections IV 
and V. Table 5 also gives percentages for the 
top five dialogue connectors. There are none in 
H-C.

Some interesting phatics: 
From F-F:

k\[dding, fool, yuk, you nitwit, what a pity, 
Just a sac. 
From T-T: 
bleep, more to come, ook, ook to you, 
congrtltns, cmt => grt idea, stand by, you 
turkey ("look" occurred in 3 protocols, which is 
quite interesting considering the mode). 
From H-C: 
yes, I know how you feel, no, are you a 
computer?, of course, ?, foo to you, what is 
your problem?, there must be a better way, 
bla...bla, why don't you understand my question? 
help, where are we machine?, you lie, good, 
thank you. 
IV. The Human-to-Computer Mode: 
Special Characteristics 
i. Performance of the System 
The system performance was such that meaningful 
work could be accomplished by largely unini- 
tiated subjects with a bare minimum of assis- 
tance. Response to inputs which were not under- 
stood was extremely fast, the incidence of bugs 
was low (out of 1615 messages, 12 hit bugs) and 
recovery from them was excellent. Response 
times were quite adequate, especially since many 
requests involved quite a bit of computation. 
The subjects never showed impatience or boredom, 
but apparently used the latency time (from input 
to response) to formulate the next request. 
2. The Influence of the Specific Task 
The special task at hand and the special 
character of a problem solving situation both 
have an influence on the performance of the sub- 
Jects. The "prompt sequence" for loading the 
ship provided in the language was used by all 
subjects even though they could have accom- 
plished the same thing by natural dialogue (the 
magical number "7" shows up again here in the 
average of 7.6 loading sequences per protocol). 
The percentage of items loaded is lower than in 
the F-F but this is due to the considerably 
longer initial orienatation period in H-C (from 
1/2 to I hour), after which the rate of loading 
increases. About 50% of items were loaded in 
F-F in one hour, so the task is completable In 
about two hours. About 20% of the \[terns were 
loaded in H-C, but considering that the rate of 
loading increased in the last half hour of the 
sessions, the task was also doable in about 2 
hours. The solution of the problem was not how- 
ever of interest in these experiments. The 
influence of the problem solving situation was 
196 
very evident, particularly on syntax. The ques- 
tion (request) -- response interchanges are dom- 
inant in all modes. Rather short sentences used 
are also attributable to this. Fragments are 
useful for increasing the flow of information. 
Phatics facilitate interaction. 
3. Syntax 
The types of sentences used is of particular 
interest here, so detailed analysis was made 
wit\]\] respect to sentence structure and type. 
The results are summarized in Table 6. 
TABLE 6 
Sentence Types 
Total % 
All sentences 882 
Simple sentences, e.g., "List the 
decks of the Alamo." 651 73.8 
Sentences with pronouns, e.g., "What 
is its length?", "What is in its 
pyrotechnic locker?" 30 3.4 
Sentences with quantifier(s), e.g., 
"List the class of each cargo." 71 8.0 
Sentences with conjunctions, e.g., 
"What is the maximum stow height 
and bale cube of the pyrotechnic 
locker of the AL?" 88 10.0 
Sentences wit\]\] quantifier and conjunc- 
tion(s), e.g., "List hatch width and 
hatch length of each deck of the 
Alamo." 23 2.6 
Sentences with relative clause, e.g., 
"List the ships that have water." 6 .7 
Sentences with relative clause (or 
related construction) and comparator, 
e.g., "List the ships with beam less 
than 1000." 6 .7 
Sentences with quantifier and relative 
clause, e.g., "List height of each 
content whose class is class IV." 2 .23 
Sentences with quantifier, conjunction 
and relative clause, e.g., "List 
length, width and height of each 
content whose class is ammunition." 2 .23 
Sentences with quantifiers and compar- 
ator, e.g., "How many ships have a 
beam greater than 1000?" 3 .34 
The dominance of simple sentences is strik- 
ing. The reason is certainly not the lack of 
availability of complex sentences. I think that 
several reasons account for this. The problem 
solving situation influences the subjects to 
work in a simple manner, often employing what I 
have termed success strategy, i.e., repetition 
of the same type of requests. Another reason is 
definitions. Once the subject has introduced a 
definition whose right hand side is often com- 
plex, involving conjunctions, relative clauses, 
even quantifiers, they are used in subsequent 
requests, which are therefore short and simple. 
Another reason may be simply the computer. As 
Robinson 13 and Grosz 14 noted, subjects tend to 
be more formal in conversat ion with the 
computer. 
Sentences were also analysed as to their type, 
since it was noticed that a great number of them 
were of the W~l-type and contained be-verbs, 
e.g., "What are ships?". The results confirmed 
the observation: 75% were WH-type questions. 
Only I% were Yes-No type questions, e.g., "Is 
Alamo a ship?", "Is there a deck whose primary 
use is ammunition and whose length is 396?". 
Commands, most commonly starting wit}\] "List", 
accounted for 19% of sentences, and a special 
category of statements, data addition, for the 
remaining 5%. These results are very interest- 
ing but I hesitate to effer an explanation. In 
the analysis of two F-F protocols consisting of 
15500 words it was found that a be-verb occurred 
once every two sentences. Since be-verbs are so 
common also in F-F, this may either be a general 
feature of English or oF. the type of conversa- 
tions in such problem solving tasks. 
Concerning the occurrence of other verbs, 
few sentences contained HAVE-verbs. No other 
verbs were part of the version of the grammar 
available to the subjects. Verbs could have 
been introduced by definition, but nobody did 
so. Possessives and sentences with "there" were 
observed, but surprisingly few in view of the 
availability of these structures in the grammar. 
The use of the article "the" was erratic. The 
investigation of the F-F sample also showed few 
relative pronouns; "that" was the most common -- 
one in every 19 sentences. Conjunctions were 
fairly freqnent -- one in every 8 sentences, 
"and" being the dominant one; likewise quantif- 
lets -- one in every 10 sentences. This coin- 
cides well with the sentence analysis for H-C 
where sentences with conjunctions or quantifiers 
are the highest in percentage among the complex 
ones. 
On the whole, one is forced to conclude that 
monotony of structure is the rule rather than 
the exception in H-C. 
4. Definitions~ Fragments and Phatics 
The REL System allows the user to avail himself 
of a great variety of definitions 6 which, how- 
ever, is not too well reflected in the proto- 
cols, due to the subjects" lack of familiarity 
with the system. One subject whom I observed as 
\]laving familiarized himself with the system made 
extensive use of definitions. It should be 
added that, beyond those which were actually 
used, 30 more definitions were attempted but 
contained errors. Some definitions had been 
built in by the language designer, notably 
"remaining area" and "adjusted remaining area." 
These were frequently employed. 
I have made a rough categorization of the defin- 
itions according to their complexity. Abbrevia- 
tions are the simplest, e.g., "def:DKS:decks of 
the USS Alamo". But even abbreviations can be 
sophisticated and therefore more useful like the 
197 
following one with a quantifier: "def:ED:each 
deck of the Alamo." Abbreviations accounted for 
34% of the total of 53 definitions. Synonyms 
were more complex: "def:INFl:aft width and for- 
ward width and minimum clearance," 
"def : INF2: INF 1 and square foot capacity," 
"def:"well deck" info:INF2 of the "well deck" of 
the Alamo." Synonyms accounted for half (51%) of 
the definitions. Of the remainder, 9% involved 
arithmet teal operations, e.g., 
"def :size: (length*width)/144", 
"def:g("8","9"):"8"*"8"+"9"*"9". A few definl- 
lions had to do with adding new data. 
Other than definitions, fragments were of 
two types: parsed, which were Terse Question and 
Terse Reply, and nonparsed, which were False 
Starts and Phatics. TQs were noun phrases which 
are parsed into sentences if followed by a ques- 
tion mark, e.g., "Class of culvert?", "i2*(SQ of 
MEZ)/(450/12)?" There are 67 of those. TRs 
were single words or numbers arrising from the 
partlcular feature provided by the system to 
deal with long answers. It reads, e.g., "There 
are 203 lines in this answer. How many do you 
want? Respond with "all', "none" or a number." 
It was considered important to include them, 
since failure to respond resulted in an error 
message, and also to see to what extent that 
feature is useful; it is, since there were 91 
TRs. No distinction was made between False 
Start and Truncated; in all cases, these 30 
oceurences were messages abandoned by the sub- 
ject for reasons that are seldom identifiable. 
A typing error may have been noticed or a 
thought changed, e.g., H: "What are the decks 
and primary uss" C: "Input Error" H: "what are 
the primary uses of each deck of the Alamo?" 
What is surprising about fragments is the pau- 
city of TQs. They are handled by the system 
very well and are certainly shorter to type. ! 
think that the reasons again are lack o~ fami- 
liarity with the system and more formal style on 
the part of the subject. But it is also possi- 
ble that such elliptical structures are somehow 
more difficult to use, which would confirm 
transformational theory, but poses an uncomfort- 
able question as to the desirability (widely 
assumed) of ellipsis In computatlonal interac- 
tion. 
Phatlcs are very peculiar in these H-C pro- 
tocols. What ts striking is the anthropomorphi- 
sation of the computer. This may be due to the 
background of the subjects, Caltech. They 
clearly also serve the function of venting one's 
emotions, and that may be useful. They are 
illustrated in Section III and number 46. 
5. Special Strate~ies~ Learning, Persistence of 
Errors 
A number of interesting strategies with respect 
to the use of language were observed. The dis- 
cussion here is Just lllnstcative, but the anno- 
tation off the protocols shows that they were 
quite frequently employed. They are pretty self 
explanatory. (a) Paraphrase: e.g., H: "What do 
the DKS usually hold?" C: "Input error, please 
re-enter request" H: "What are the primary uses 
of the DKS?". Similarly: "Now long \[s the 
Anchorage?" "What Is the length of the 
Anchorage?". (b) Success: this usually 
involves repetitious structure of a sequence of 
requests, e.g., "What relations are there?" 
"what shlp classes are there?" "Describe the 
AL." "Describe the DKS." "Describe water." 
"Describe " tank. ? (c) Simplification of Sen- 
tence Structure: e.g., H: "What \[s the maximum 
stow helght,bale cube,square foot capacity and 
top stack number of the cube of the PL?" C: 
"Input error..." H: "what is the maximum stow 
height and bale cube of the PL?" C: "40 72" H: 
"What ls the square foot capacity and top stack 
number oF. the PL?" C: "36 0". This example 
illustrates also the strategy of suspecting, and 
therefore changing, syntax. The subject made 
mistakes in punctuatlon by not using spaces, but 
changed syntax instead. That was quite a common 
strategy. Another example follows. (d) Mis- 
trust of Syntax: e.g., "What is known about the 
hatch of each deck of Alamo?" "What is known 
about hatches?" "What is the deck of each 
hatch?" "What is known ahout hatch?" Each of 
these questions resulted in an ecror message, 
because the word "hatch" was not In the vocal)u- 
l ary. But the subject persistently changes syn- 
tax and morphology rather than vocabulary. In 
the following example, the subject misspelled 
the word "height", but still changes syntax 
first: "The heigth of the Alamo/39?" "What is 
the height of the well deck of the Alamo/39?" 
(e) Grammar Test in~: this was not very fre- 
quent, but interesting: "What are the primary 
uses of each deck of the Alamo?" "What ls the 
primary use of each deck of the Alamo?" (f) Data 
Add ltion: one subject added a new class: 
"item:=class", and then made all items to be 
loaded members of this class: "Water is an 
item." "Conwire is an item."..., thus enabling 
himself to deal with all Items: "Llst dimensions 
of items." 
Learning is evident throughout the proto- 
~:ols. It ranges from a simple correction of a 
misspelling or punctuatlon error to changing the 
syntax, for Instance to obtain more specific 
answers; e.g., "What ls it's beam?" (repeatd 
three times) "What is its beam?", H: "What ls 
the minimum clearance of each deck?" C: "There 
are 224 lines ..." H: "What is the minimum 
clearance of each deck of the Alamo?" 
Pertstence of errors was occasionally 
found, as in the next to last example, and the 
ffollowing dialogue -- which shows a variety of 
errors and strategies such as success, mistrust- 
ing syntax, breaking the input into shorter 
ones, adding a quant\[fier instead of correcting 
punctuation. This sequence also illustrates 
some of the errors analyzed in the next subsec- 
tion (6).

6. Analysls of Errors 
Errors are all of those inputs that are not 
parsed, resulting in error messages. Not 
included in this analysis however are phatics 
and false starts, already covered. The message: 
"Input error, please re-enter request" is issued 
in all cases except when the system requests a 
response and the user fails to give one that can 
be ~inderstood, in which case the message is: 
"Your response is not understandable. Try 
again.", and in the case of bugs, where it 
reads: "Your request could not be completed as 
entered. Please rephrase and try again." 
The total of 446 errors were classified 
into eight categories: (a) Vocabulary ' Errors: 
arising from the lack of a word in the language, 
e.g., "big" in "Is the Mobile a big ship?", 
"feet" in "List the decks of each shlp with 
square feet capacity less than 70.". This being 
by  fat the largest category, the importance of 
the semantic facto~ ls clear. (b) Punctuation: 
involves sentence final marks, commas and 
spaces; they are well illustrated in Figure 2. 
(c) Synta___x: the low incidence of these errors 
is surprising; formal style, repetitiousness of 
structure, expediency in problem solving may al\[ 
be factors. Errors involving conjunctions or 
preposistlons are typical. Some difficult to 
categorize, nonparsed inputs were also included 
here, such as: "What is known?". In some cases, 
there ave vocabulary errors but the syntax could 
not have been handled either, typically: "On 
what decks of the Alamo may cargo be stowed?", 
"stow" and "may" being not known. This input 
was immediately paraphrased as "What is the pri- 
mary use of each deck of the Alamo?" and handled 
correctly; so one may wonder what ts \[nvolved in 
cases which could not be reasonably expected to 
be handled. (d) Spelling: the only interest- 
ing observation is that some subjects noticed 
these errors immediately, others not for a 
while. (e) Transmission: terminal and phone 
line errors. (f) Definition Format: all 
errors in framing definitions are included here, 
whether vocabulary, punctuation or format. (g) 
Lack of Response: to "There are xx lines in 
this answer. How many do you want?" One sub- 
ject tried 6 careful requests before catching 
on. (h) BuR:  the actual number of bugs 
encountered was very low. In a very few cases 
they resulted in termination of the session.

In general, errors were far fewer and far 
different from what I expected. The high intel- 
lectual level of the subjects cannot account for 
that, since it was more than counterbalanced by 
lack of familiarity with the system and lack of 
knowledge of the task. What should be done 
about errors~ and indeed what we are doing, is 
discussed in Section V. 
V. Habitability and Naturalness o f  Human- 
Computer Interaction: Sqme Conclusions 
The purpose of the experiments was to learn 
more about dialogues with the view to enhancing 
interaction with computers. What have we 
learned, and what are we doing? First, our 
guiding eonvlc t tons have been confirmed : 
English, especially if angmented to suit 
specific tasks, is a natural and useful medium. 
The Job of improving it is open-ended; English 
for the computer will never be all of English, 
since English is in reality not one language, 
but a variety of languages, among some of which 
all speakers choose freely, and many belong to 
specialists. 
Our task is to build as good a system as 
our understanding permits, observe the results 
of its use in actual tasks, and then with 
increased understanding continue to Improve. 
The REI. System served well in the experiments; 
its rapid response time was well worth achieving 
--199 
\[f for this purpose alone. But it is no longer 
a research tool. We are now building the POL 
(Problem Oriented Language) System. 15 Wqlat we 
have learned from the experiments \[s having a 
major influence on its design. Advances in 
parallel to our own are changing the human- 
computer relationship, and POL reflects these 
too. 7,16-19 Unlike REL, POL is programmed in a 
high-level language and thus more amenable for 
the research tasks that lie ahead.

sense 8 and rapid response time remain our major 
concerns. Whatever improvements are introduced 
have to meet these requirements. Experiments 
leave no doubt as to their essentiality. Intel- 
ligent system response to the user, using his 
knowledge base, and support for building that 
knowledge base using the facile capabilities of 
English, are two major areas where changes are 
made. 
Much is being done in the response to 
errors. REL was particularly weak in this area 
as Figure 2 on errors shows. Punctuation rules 
were too stringent, these can easily be relaxed 
and so designed as to almost entirely remove 
this source of error. For example, final punc- 
tuation can in almost all cases be added or 
corrected, and any ambiguities clarified grace- 
fully. Even in REL "List . . . .  " and "List ... 
?" are accepted, to the relief of users. 
Defaulted responses and responses that add addi- 
tional information should be acccepted; for 
example, lack of response to "There are 203 
lines..." caused 16 errors in the protocols, yet 
in the POL design it is handled by defaulting. 
Identification of words not in the w)cabu- 
Lary and spelling correction did not exist in 
REL, resulting in a great deal of frustration. 
The two are related, and together accounted for 
50 percent of errors. A problem here is the 
time inherent \[n spelling correction, however 
the new lexicon methods introduced in POL show 
promise of solving this problem. Syntactic and 
semantic means are used, as well as lexical, to 
identify intended usage, and echo is used to 
inform the user of the correction that is made; 
If the intent is not clearly identifiable, the 
user is infom~ed, ILsting the troublesome words. 
The users should be encouraged and guided 
to avail themselves of the wide range of defini- 
tional capabilities. This is a primary way for 
users to directly build knowledge into the sys- 
tem. Def\[nition guides and help sequences are 
available in POL to this end. A major aspect of 
definitions is multiple defining of terms. To 
illustrate from one application of REL, the 
notion of "net sales" was defined in five ways; 
th~is one could ask for "net sales of 
d\[odes","net sales of the Eastern Sales Region", 
"net sales of salesman Jones,"; the internal 
ambiguity was always clarified in context. How- 
ever, the stat\[stlcs from the experiments show- 
ing that of the ,q3 attempts at def\[nitlon 30 
were not sucessful point to needed improvements 
in making this capability available. I feel 
especially that the incorporation of verbs which 
are introduced by definitional paraphrase and 
which were used in other REL applications 
enhances naturalness, even though the experi- 
ments showed a preference for be-verbs. 
The area of pronouns and ellipsis in gen- 
eral is, of course, very important. Pronouns 
worked to a certain extent in REL and they have 
been throughly revised for the POL Syste~ pro- 
fitiug from the work of Grosz, 14 $\[dner and 
Robinson. 16 This area, however, will require 
much additional effort if we are to recognize 
the wide range of fragments - terse question, 
added information, and terse information. Some 
forms were handled by REL, e.g., "Dimensions of 
eonwire?". However forms such as: "How about 
..." and "Those of ..." need to be added. Added 
Information might be handled in such a sequence 
as "Consider John, Joan, Betty and Bob. John 
and Bob are males. Joan and Betty are females. 
All are doctors." or "What is the longest 
tanker? Only Norwegian." Terse information and 
dialogue connectors may also be considered, for 
instance: "List the dimensions of vehicles.", 
and, following the answer, "And pallets." 
Although I have only touched upon it 
briefly here, the prompt sequence in loading 
shlps was an effective tool whose usefullness 
was strongly supported by the experiments. The 
setting up ,of such abbreviated means of communi- 
cation by the user, as well as their use, will 
be supported in POL. 
Finally, what about phatics? Should they 
be part of the computer's language? One is led 
by their wide use in face-to-face to include 
phatic messages from the computer, as is done in 
some of the other natural language systems. 
"Welcome," "Okay," "Thank you" are already in 
wide use. More of that nature would not hurt, 
within reason. Some inputs from the computer 
would undoubtedly be appreciated, such as: "Be 
patient, l'm working on it." if the computation 
is long or response delayed. 
Is the recognition of users" phatlcs and 
response to them desirable? Fillmore 21 pointed 
out that politeness can be carried too far, as 
In the sequence: A: "You have lovely eyes." B: 
"Thank you." A: "You are welcome." Chafe 22 
seems to be ready to see more human-like 
behavior on the part of the computer, even using 
variations in typing speed as a means of intro- 
ducing a form of intonation and emphasis. We 
are currently investigating phatlcs, but while 
it could be interesting to observe users" reac- 
tions in this respect, naturalness may be more 
highly enhanced in other areas. And so, not 
knowing how to respond, swearing is likely to 
remain ignored by the forever imperfect com- 
puter.
