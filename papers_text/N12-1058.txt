Abstract
This paper describes our ongoing work on
resolving third person pronouns and deictic
words in a multi-modal corpus. We show that
about two thirds of these referring expressions
have antecedents that are introduced by point-
ing gestures or by haptic-ostensive actions
(actions that involve manipulating an object).
After describing our annotation scheme, we
discuss the co-reference models we learn from
multi-modal features. The usage of haptic-
ostensive actions in a co-reference model is a
novel contribution of our work.
1 Introduction
Co-reference resolution has received a lot of atten-
tion. However, as Eisenstein and Davis (2006)
noted, most research on co-reference resolution has
focused on written text. This task is much more
difficult in dialogue, especially in multi-modal di-
alogue contexts. First, utterances are informal, un-
grammatical and disfluent. Second, people sponta-
neously use gestures and other body language. As
noticed by Kehler (2000), Goldin-Meadow (2003),
and Chen et al (2011), in a multi-modal corpus,
the antecedents of referring expressions are often in-
troduced via gestures. Whereas the role played by
pointing gestures in referring has been studied, the
same is not true for other types of gestures. In this
paper, alongside pointing gestures, we will discuss
the role played by Haptic-Ostensive (H-O) actions,
i.e., referring to an object by manipulating it in the
world (Landragin et al, 2002; Foster et al, 2008).
As far as we know, no computational models of co-
reference have been developed that include H-O ac-
tions: (Landragin et al, 2002) focused on percep-
tual salience and (Foster et al, 2008) on generation
rather than interpretation. We should point out that
at the time of writing we only focus on resolving
third person pronouns and deictics.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we describe our multi-modal annotation
scheme. In Section 3 we present the pronoun/deictic
resolution system. In Section 4, we discuss experi-
ments and results.
2 The Data Set
The dataset we use in this paper is a subset of the
ELDERLY-AT-HOME corpus (Di Eugenio et al,
2010), a multi-modal corpus in the domain of elderly
care. It contains 20 human-human dialogues. In
each dialogue, a helper (HEL) and an elderly person
(ELD) performed Activities of Daily Living (Krapp,
2002), such as getting up from chairs, finding pots,
cooking pastas, in a realistic setting, a studio apart-
ment used for teaching and research. The corpus
contains videos and voice data in avi format, haptics
data collected via instrumented gloves in csv format,
and the transcribed utterances in xml format.
We focused on specific subdialogues in this cor-
pus, that we call Find tasks: a Find task is a con-
tinuous time span during which the two subjects
were collaborating on finding objects. Find tasks
arise naturally while helping perform ADLs such as
preparing dinner. An excerpt from a Find task
is shown below, including annotations for pointing
gestures and for H-O actions (annotations are per-
523
formed via the Anvil tool (Kipp, 2001)).
ELD : Can you get me a pot?
HEL: (opens cabinet, takes out pot, without saying a word)
[Open(HEL,Cabinet1),Take-Out(HEL,Pot1)]
ELD: Not that one, try over there.
[Point(ELD,Cabinet5)]
Because the targets of pointing gestures and H-
O actions are real life objects, we designed a refer-
ring index system to annotate them. The referring
index system consists of compile time indices and
run time indices. We give pre-defined indices to tar-
gets which cannot be moved, like cabinets, draw-
ers, fridge. We assign run time indices to targets
which can be moved, and exist in multiple copies,
like cups, glasses. A referring index consists of a
type and an index; the index increases according to
the order of appearance in the dialogue. For exam-
ple, ?Pot#1? means the first pot referred to in the
dialogue. If a pointing gesture or H-O action in-
volved multiple objects, we used JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation)1 Array to mark it. For example,
[C#1, C#2] means Cabinet#1 and Cabinet#2.
We define a pointing gesture as a hand gesture
without physical contact with the target, whereas
gestures that involve physical contact with an ob-
ject are haptic-obstensive (H-O).2 We use four tracks
in Anvil to mark these gestures, two for pointing
gestures, and two for H-O actions. In each pair of
tracks, one track is used for HEL, one for ELD. For
both types of gestures, we mark the start time, end
time and the target(s) of the gesture using the re-
ferring index system we introduced above. Addi-
tionally we mark the type of an H-O action: Touch,
Hold, Take-Out (as in taking out an object from a
cabinet or the fridge), Close, Open.3
Our co-reference annotation follows an approach
similar to (Eisenstein and Davis, 2006). We mark
the pronouns and deictics which need to be resolved,
their antecedents, and the co-reference links be-
tween them. To mark pronouns, deictics and tex-
tual antecedents, we use the shallow parser from
1http://www.json.org/
2Whereas not all haptic actions are ostensive, in our dia-
logues they all potentially perform an ostensive function.
3Our subjects occasionally hold objects together, e.g. to fill
a pot with water: these actions are not included among the H-O
actions, and are annotated separately.

Apache OpenNLP Tools 4 to chunk the utterances in
each turn. We use heuristics rules to automatically
mark potential textual antecedents and the phrases
we need to resolve. Afterwards we use Anvil to edit
the results of automatic processing. To annotate co-
reference links, we first assign each of the textual
antecedents, the pointing gestures and H-O actions
a unique markable index. Finally, we link referring
expressions to their closest antecedent (if applicable)
using the markable indices.
Table 1 shows corpus and annotation statistics.
We annotated 142 Find subtasks, whose total length
is about 1 hour and 24 minutes. This sub-corpus
comprises 1746 spoken turns, which include 8213
words. 10% of the 8213 words (827 words) are pro-
nouns or deictics. Note that for only 757/827 (92%)
were the annotators able to determine an antecedent.
Interestingly, 71% of those 757 pronouns or deictics
refer to specific antecedents that are introduced ex-
clusively by gestures, either pointing or H-O actions.
In the earlier example, only the type for the referent
of that in No, not that one had been introduced textu-
ally, but not its specific antecedent pot1. Clearly, to
be effective on such data any model of co-reference
must include the targets of pointing gestures and H-
O actions. Our current model does not take into ac-
count the type provided by the de dicto interpretation
of indefinites such as a pot above, but we intend to
address this issue in future work.
In order to verify the reliability of our annotations,
we double coded 15% of the data for pointing ges-
tures and H-O actions, namely the dialogues from
3 pairs of subjects, or 22 Find subtasks. We ob-

tained reasonable ? values: for pointing gestures,
?=0.751, for H-O actions, ?=0.703, and for co-
reference, ?=0.70.
3 The Co-reference Model
In this paper we focus on how to use gesture infor-
mation (pointing or H-O) to solve the referring ex-
pressions of interest. Given a pronoun or deictic, we
build co-reference pairs by pairing it with the targets
of pointing gestures and H-O actions in a given time
window. We mark the correct pairs as ?True? and
then we train a classification model to judge if a co-
reference pair is a true pair. The main component
of the resolution system is the co-reference classifi-
cation model. Since our antecedents are not textual,
most of the traditional features for co-reference res-
olution do not apply. Rather, we use the following
multi-modal features - U is the utterance containing
the pronoun / deictic to be solved:
? Time distance between the spans of U and of
the pointing/H-O action. If the two spans over-
lap, the distance is 0.
? Speaker agreement: If the speaker of U and the
actor of the pointing/H-O action are the same.
? Markable type agreement: If the markable type
of the pronoun/deictic and of the targets of
pointing gesture/H-O action are compatible.
? Number agreement: If the number of the pro-
noun/deictic is the same as that of the targets of
the pointing gesture/H-O action.
? Object agreement: If the deictic is contained
in a phrase, such as ?this big blue bowl?,
we will check if the additional object descrip-
tion ?bowl? matches the targets of pointing
gesture/H-O action.
? H-O Action type: for co-reference pairs with
antecedents from H-O actions.
For markable type agreement, we defined two
types of markables: PLC (place) and OBJ (object).
PLC includes all the targets which cannot easily
be moved, OBJ includes all the targets like cups,
pots. We use heuristics rules to assign markable
types to pronouns/deictics and the targets of point-
ing gestures/H-O actions. To determine the number
of the targets, we extract information from the an-
notations; if the target is a JSON array, it means it
is plural. To extract additional object description for
the object agreement feature, we use the Stanford
Typed Dependency parser (De Marneffe and Man-
ning., 2008). We check if the pronoun/deictic is in-
volved in ?det? and ?nsubj? relations, if so, we ex-
tract the ?gov? element of that relation as the object
to compare with the target of gestures/H-O actions.
4 Experiments and Discussions
We have experimented with 3 types of classification
models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Decision
Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respec-
tively implemented via the following three pack-
ages: MaxEnt, J48 from Weka (Hall et al, 2009),
and LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011). All of the
results reported below are calculated using 10 fold
cross validation.
We have run a series of experiments changing the
history length from 0 to 10 seconds for generating
co-reference pairs (history changes in increments of
1 second, hence, there are 11 sets of experiments).
For each history length, we build the 3 models men-
tioned above. An additional baseline model treats a
co-reference pair as ?True? if speaker agreement is
true for the pair, and the time distance is 0. Beside
the specified baseline, J48 can be seen as a more so-
phisticated baseline as well. When we ran the 10
fold experiment with J48 algorithm, 5 out of 10 gen-
erated decision trees only used 3 attributes.
We use two metrics to measure the performance
of the models. One are the standard precision, re-
call and F-Score with respect to the generated co-
reference pairs; the other is the number of pro-
nouns and deictics that are correctly resolved. Given
a pronoun/deictic pi, if the classifier returns more
than one positive co-reference pair for pi, we use a
heuristic resolver to choose the target. We divide
those positive pairs into two subsets, those where
the speaker of pi is the same as the performer of the
gesture (SAME), and those with the other speaker
(OTHER). If SOME is not empty, we will choose
SOME, otherwise OTHER. If the chosen set con-
tains more than one pair, we will choose the target

Table 2: Gesture&Haptics Co-reference Model Results
of the gesture/H-O action in the most recent pair.
Given the space limit, Table 2 only shows the
results for each model which resolved most pro-
nouns/deictics, and the model which produced the
best F-score. In Table 2, with the change of History
window setting, the gold standard of co-reference
pairs change. When the history window is larger,
there are more co-reference candidate pairs, which
help resolve more pronouns and deictics.
Given we work on a new corpus, it is hard to
compare our results to previous work, additionally
our models currently do not deal with textual an-
tecedents. For example Strube and Mu?ller (2003)
reports their best F-Measure as .4742, while ours
is .747. As concerns accuracy, whereas 384/827
(46%) may appear low, note the task we are per-
forming is harder since we are trying to solve all pro-
nouns/deictics via gestures, not only the ones which
have an antecedent introduced by a pointing or H-O
action (see Table 1). Even if our feature set is lim-
ited, all the classification models perform better than
baseline in all the experiments; the biggest improve-
ment is 14.4% in F-score, and solving 25 more pro-
nouns and deictics. There are no significant differ-
ences in the performances of the 3 different classifi-
cation models. Table 2 shows that the history length
of the best models is less than or equal to 2 seconds,
which is within the standard error range of annota-
tions when we marked the time spans for events.
5 Conclusions
This paper introduced our multi-modal co-reference
annotation scheme that includes pointing gestures
and H-O actions in the corpus ELDERLY-AT-
HOME. Our data shows that 2/3 of antecedents of
pronouns/deictics are introduced by pointing ges-
tures or H-O actions, and not in speech. A co-
reference resolution system has been built to resolve
pronouns and deictics to the antecedents introduced
by pointing gestures and H-O actions. The classi-
fication models show better performance than the
baseline model. In the near future, we will integrate
a module which can resolve pronouns and deictics to
textual antecedents, including type information pro-
vided by indefinite descriptions. This will make the
system fully multi-modal. Additionally we intend
to study issues of timing. Preliminary studies of our
corpus show that the average distance between a pro-
noun/deictic and its antecedent is 8.26? for textual
antecedents, but only 0.66? for gesture antecedents,
consistent with our results that show the best models
include very short histories, at most 2? long.
