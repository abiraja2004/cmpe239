Abstract 
A readability formula is obtained that can be used by com- 
puter programs for style checking of Japanese texts and need not 
syntactic or semantic information. The formula is derived as a 
linear combination of tile surface characteristics of the text that are 
related to its readability: (1) the average number of characters per 
sentence, (2) for each type of characters (Roman alphabets, kanzis, 
hiraganas, katakanas), relative frequencies of rims (maximal 
swings) that ,:onsists only of that type of characters, (3) the average 
number of characters per each type of runs, and (4) tooten 
(comma) to kuten (period) ratio. 
To find the proper weighting, principal component analysis 
(PCA) was appliedto these characteristics taken from 77 sample 
texts. 
We have found a component which is related to the readabil- 
ity. Its scores match to the empirical knowledges of reading ease. 
We have also obtained experimental confirmation that the com- 
ponent is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of reading, by the 
cloze procedure and by the examination on the average lime taken 
to fill out one blank of the cloze texts. 
1o Introduction 
This study aims to obtain a readability formula that can be 
used by computer programs for style checking of Japanese texts. A 
readability formula predicts the difficulty of a document that may 
result from its writing style, but not from its content, organization, 
or format. A readability index is calculated from the measures of 
surface characteristics of the document that are thought to indicate 
the stylistic difficulty without an attempt to parse sentences or to 
consult a large dictionary. 
Many of the readability formulae for English, (for example, 
Flesch's Reading Ease Score/Fleseh 1949/and Automated Reada- 
bility Index/Smith 1970/), use the average length (number of syll- 
ables or lettors) of words and the average number of words in sen- 
tences in a document for calculating the readability index. Word 
length is a measure of the lexical difficulty, i.e., difficulty of the 
vocabulary used in the document. Sentence l ngth is a measure of 
the Syntactic difficulty or complexity of the sentence. While reao 
dability indices are derived from simple formulae, they predict rea- 
sonably well the difficulty of a document. This is because the sen- 
tence length and the word length are highly correlated with 
features uch as the complexity of the sentence and the difficulty 
of the word, respectively. 
Existing scoring methods for Japanese, such as the one pro- 
posed by/Morioka 1958/or/Yasumoto 1983/, use the sentenco 
length measured in letters instead of words and the percentage of
kanzis (Chinese characters), the latter used for estimating the 
difficulty of the vocabulary. Both rate the average number of 
letters per sentence and the percentage of kanzis in the text 
independen|ly and do not combine the two factors into a single 
index. A te~t with longer sentences i estimated as difficult, and a 
text with more kanzis is also estimated as difficult. Morioka, who 
surveyed on school textbooks, showed that the upper grade text- 
books contain longer sentences on the average and more kanzi. 
Yasumoto states that documents with more kanzi are less readable 
even for adults, for the following reason. Kanzi are logograms, 
one roughly corresponding to a word. Documents using more 
kanzis, therefore, apt to include more different words and should 
demand more reading skill. 
A problem of rating the sentence l ngth and the percentage of
kanzi independently is that these two may yield an inconsistent rat- 
ing. Generally, a sentence becomes longer if its kanzis are rewrit- 
ten in kanas. Thus sentence lengths depend on representations. 
There seems to have been no attempt on combining the factors of 
sentence l ngth and the proportion of kanzi. On the other hand, no 
rationale is given for the separate measurements. It is possible to 
derive a single index that can assess readability of Japanese text. 
/Sakamoto 1967/proposed a method of scoring the relative 
difficulty of children's books to match the reading skill of the 
intended readers. His method consists of three independent rat- 
ings; (1) the proportion of fundamental words based on/Sakamoto 
1958/, (2) the proportion of sentences that are made of more than 
10 words, and (3) the proportion of kanzi. However, Sakamoto's 
method introduce the problem of measuring sentence length in 
words in place of tile conflict between sentence length and 
representation. 
Using word count o1' word length as an estimator of readabil- 
ity is not practical in the case of Japanese. Since Japanese does 
not use word segmentations i  nomaal writing, dividing sentences 
into words needs parsing and consulting dictionary. Thus, a scor- 
ing method based on words, such as Sakamoto's, is costly. This is 
especially so when scoring is done by a computer, because xtra 
devices uch as parsers, a large dictionary, and, sometimes, eman- 
tic analyzers are required for word segmentation alone. 
Another problem with the traditional scoring methods is that 
they have ignored katakana, which are used to represent foreign 
words. Recent documents, especially scientific and technical ones, 
use a lot of foreign words. /Watanabe 1983/reports that, in a 
year's issues of the Jonrual of lnfonnation Processing Society of 
Japan, Vol. 17, about an eighth among the characters used is kata- 
kana. /Satake 1982/surveyed the article of magazines published 
today and found that the ratio of katakana ranged from 4.44 to 
13.75 percent. Thus percentage of katakana is not negligible in 
scoring today's documents. Katakana words mean imported 
foreign words, old and new, which are often unfamiliar to readers. 
Yet existing measures take into account only kanzi and are 
insufficient to score the today's technically oriented ocuments. 
2. Factors of Readability 
We have chosen the following four surface characteristics a
factors of readability: 
(1) relative frequency of characters for each type of characters, 
(2) the length of a run (maximal string that consists of one type 
of characters),. 
(3) the length of a sentence, and 
(4) the number of tooten s (commas) per sentence. 
The former two are related to the difficulty of vocabulary in a 
document; he latter two are related to the complexity of sentences 
in a document. 
649 
Character Frequencies 
The most common Japanese writing system is based on the 
mixture of kanzis, kanas (hiraganas and katakanas), the Roman 
alphabets, Arabic numerals, and some other alphabets and sym- 
bols. Almost al! normal writing is a mixture of kanzis, hiraganas, 
and katakanas (and others). Frequencies of types of characters in a 
Japanese text are known to affect its readability at least in the fol- 
lowing manner: Kanzi, as mentioned before, are considered to 
make texts difficult. Since katakana nd alphabets are used for 
foreign words, high frequencies of these characters indicate that 
the text contain many unfamiliar words. Hiragana are used to 
represent the rest of the text and more of them are considered to 
make texts easier. There is no rigid orthography for Japanese. 
Nevertheless, the way an adult Japanese spells out a sentence in 
usual writing is roughly fixed. Kanzis are used for nouns and for 
the root parts of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and the like. Hiraganas 
are used to write inflections and other grammatical parts of sen- 
tences, and katakanas are used mainly for the transcription of 
foreign words. So in passages written in the common way, the use 
of types of characters, i.e., kanzi, hiragana, katakana, etc., reflects 
the use of vocabulary and can be an' indicator of the difficulty of 
the passage. 
It is possible to write the words usually written in kanzi in 
hiragana. However, psychological experiments such as the ones 
conducted by /Kitao 1960/ or /Hirose 1983/ a reader finds it 
difficult to read the texts represented in the way unfamiliar to the 
reader. In Kitao's experiment, subjects took less time to read and 
recognize the word or the sentence written in a common way than 
written solely in hiragana. In Hirose's experiment, the words usu- 
ally written in kanzi are harder to recognize than the words usually 
written in kana when both type of words are written in kana. Both 
results show that words or sentences in the representation more 
- familiar to a reader are more readable than those in less familiar 
representation. 
Runs 
In the ordinary representation, a boundary of the types of 
characters corresponds to the boundary of words or smaller gram- 
matical parts thereof. That is, a series of letters of the same type in 
the text, bounded by other character types corresponds toa word or 
a smaller grammatical part. We will call such a series a run, i.e., a 
run is a maximal string that consists of only one type of characters. 
It is not a grammatical unit. Usually, a run corresponds to one or 
more words. A verb or an adjective is often found across two runs. 
Such a word norulally has its root part written in kanzi and its 
inflection part in hiragana. 
As the boundary of runs roughly correspond to the boundary 
of words, the different graphic appearance of kanzi and kana 
letters helps a reader to parse a sentence. Hence, long runs, when 
they happen, hide the word boundaries and makes a sentence l ss 
readable. 
Long kanzi runs give another problem to the readability. 
Kango. can be formed into a compound word simply by con- 
catenating two or more of them successively. The meaning of the 
new word is formed by the meanings of its elements. However, 
how each element is related to each other in the compound word is 
not clear from mere concatenation. A reader must pragmatically 
see the relation. Therefore, it is often the case that the meaning of 
a compound kango is ambiguous. For example, siken-ki can be 
read as siken-suru-kikai (testing machine) or as siken-sareru-kikai 
(machine to be tested); rinzi-kyouiku-singi-kai meaning rinzi-ni- 
kyouiku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai (an ad hoe council to deliberate on 
education) can be read as rinzi-no-kyouiku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai 
(a council to deliberate on an ad hoe education). 
650 
It is unlikely that there may be any good theory possible 
about the relationship between run frequencies and readability. 
Nevertheless, the run frequencies may be used in a similar manner 
as character f equencies. In a study preceding this/Tateisi 1987/ 
we found that the run frequencies are correlated with the frequen- 
cies of the character of corresponding types (0.6 < r < 0.9, depend- 
ing on character types) and a unit of run is sufficient o obtain the 
information otherwise supplied by both characters and runs. 
Sentence Length 
The length of sentences i a known factor of readability as 
/Morioka 1958/and other surveys how. In Japanese, as in other 
languages, long sentences tend to have complicated structures. 
Sentence length can be measured in the number of characters 
it contains. Though Sakamoto's urvey of children's textbook 
/Sakamoto 1963/shows that the number of words per sentences i
a more accurate indicator of the grade level than the number of 
characters, it also shows that the two are in good proportion, the 
correlation coefficient being 1.00. 
Punctuation 
Tootens, like commas, are put at the end of a phrase. The 
number of tootens per sentence corresponds to the number of 
phrases per sentence. /Hayasi 1959/found that junior high school 
sU:dents and senior high students understood the text more pre- 
cisely if modifying phrases are separated and made into 
independent sentences. Following this result, a sentence with 
smaller number of phrase is easier to understand. /Kozuru 1987/ 
found that the average number of tootens in a sentence increases 
with student's grade level. These findings indicate that the number 
of tootens in a sentence is greater in more difficult-to-read texts. 
Thus, the number of tootens is a factor of readability. 
3. The Method of Analysis 
We shall first extract several numerical characteristics of
style from texts and then derive a readability formula as a linear 
combination of the values of those characteristics. A nurflerical 
index is only a rough scale of readability. It should be calculated 
with simple devices and methods. We use character as the unit of 
measuring length for the sake of simple calculation. 
Several surface characteristics are extracted from the materi- 
als. Difference of the characteristics among materials consists of 
several factors. It may be factored into variation of the topic area 
of the texts, and the variation of style. Style may differ by the 
writer or by the intentions of the text. Introductory textbooks 
should be written easier than technical papers intended for experts 
and the authors will be careful not to make it difficult to read. 
Thus they will be written in a style easier to read than the style of 
technical papers. Translations tend to have a particular style, 
highly dependent on the syntax of the original anguage. The par- 
ticular style of translations is often found awkward as Japanese and 
less readable. The distinctive feature of the texts with different 
intentions can be used as a criteria of assessing readability. 
To find the distinctive feature of texts from the surface 
characteristics, the principal component analysis (PCA) extracts 
factors of variance of the characteristics. We will then examine 
tile components, by comparing component scores for the materials 
with the empirical knowledges of readability. In this way we shall 
choose a component relevant to the stylistic readability. A princi- 
pal component is a linear combination of the variables. The for- 
mula which computes the component can be used as a readability 
formula. 
Variables 
We have chosen the ten variables that represent the four fac~ 
tots of readal~ility: 
(1) for each type of characters((Roman) lphabets, kanzis, hira- 
ganas, katakanas), relative frequency of runs (maximal 
strings) that consists only of that type of characters, 
(2) the avelage number of letters per each type of runs, 
(3) the avelage number of letters per sentence, and 
(4) tooten lo kuten ratio. 
Sentence lengfl~ is measured in the number of characters 
between two adjacent sentence-ending marks (kuten, exclamation 
marks, and question marks). Kuten, unlike period, is placed only 
at the end of a sentence, not as an indicator of abbreviations. 
Therefore, the end of a sentence is ahnost always detected by 
detecting kuten, although the end quotation embedded in a sen- 
tence is also counted as the end of a sentence. 
Samples 
We must compare the readability anaong the texts written in 
tile common way, that is, the texts written by authors as they are. 
For exampl~, the textbooks for elementary school children are 
inadequate. This is because those textbooks are written in an 
unusual way. They use hiragana where most adults use kanzi, tran- 
scribing the kanzi the readers are not expected to learn yet. 
We will therefore take the documents written by adults for 
adults as materials of the analysis. 
Seventy-seven (77) documents were selected as sample texts 
to extract he data from. Seventy of the samples are machine- 
readable documents hat were stored in our laboratory. They are 
technical papers, textbooks for collage students, and translations of
computer science materials, written by 13 authors. Seven of the 
samples are included as indicators for reading ease. Five of these 
indicators a~e text judged as easy. Three of therft are taken from 
the books on technical writing; two are taken from essays for gen- 
eral readers. They are considered to be easier than the papers or 
textbooks for scientists. The remaining two are the text judged as 
difficult. One of them is a decision on the case of an infringement 
of copyright of a computer program; the other is a juridical paper 
about copyright and new media such as magnetic tapes. Juridical 
texts are empirically known as hard to read. 
Tables~ figures, references, and expressions which are 
displayed iitdependently from the passage are deleted from tile 
samples. 
4. Result of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
The plincipal component analysis is done by S routines 
/Becker 1984/on Vax 8600 at the Computer Center of the Univer- 
sity of Tokyo. The components and the loadings of each variables 
are shown in table 4--1. 
The first three components (eigenvalue > 1) are examined. 
Total variance xplained by these components is 70%. Figure 4-1 
shows the s,:atter plot of sample texts. The letter i designate intro- 
ductory textbooks, m magazine articles other than technical 
papers, p tt~chnical papers, t and T designate translations from 
English papers, and D and E designate the difficult and easy indi- 
cators, respectively. 
The following are observed for the first component. 
(1-1) This component reflects the occurrences of alphabets; 
separates the texts with little alphabetic content and the text 
aburtdant with alphabetic content. 
(1-2) The texts with many equations and abbreviations have high 
scor,~s on this component. 
The sc.0re on this component shows the area of topic. 
The following are observed for the second component. 
(2-1) This component separates the texts with long sentences and 
long kanzi runs from the other texts. 
(2-2) The component score agrees with human judgement about 
easy/difficult texts. It is high on tile texts judged easy and 
low on the texts judged difficult. The second component 
score shows the distinction more clearly than the first or the 
third. 
(2-3) Introductory textbooks have generally higher scores than 
papers. Again, the second component score shows the dis- 
tinction more clearly than tile first or file third. 
Since long sentences and long kanzi runs make texts less 
readable as stated before, (2-1) indicates that the second com- 
ponent can be an indicator of readability. (2-2) and (2-3) also indi- 
cates that he second component is related to readability. 
The third component shows a difference of proportions of 
katakana nd kanzi. From table 4-1 we can find that the variables 
on kanzi have positive loadings and the variables on hiragana nd 
katakana have negative loadings on the component. Thus, the 
component shows the proportion of kanzi, in the way that it 
increases with texts with more kanzi. 
5. Principal Component Scores and Style 
We have observed tile following phenomena on the second 
component. 
Improvement and Principal Component Scores 
Five of the sample texts are chapters (indicated T in the 
figure 4-1) of the final versions of the translation of an English 
paper by different translators. Their component scores were com- 
pared with those of tile respective draft versions. (The drafts are 
not among the samples.) The first three component scores of the 
final manuscripts were uniformly higher than those of drafts, i.e., 
tile scores became higher with the improvement of their style. The 
differences between the final versions and the respective draft ver- 
sions are shown in table 5-1. The mean difference of the second 
eomponent is found greater than that of the first at the 5 percent 
significance (17 = 0.044) and greater than that of the third at the 10 
percent significance but not at the 5 percent significance 
(19 = 0.098). Thus, the difference of the second component is
greater than the other two. This agrees with the observations on 
the distribution of texts, that is, easier-to-read texts have higher 
second component score than difficult ones, since a text becomes 
easier to read after improvement i  general. 
Frequencies ofPassive Forms 
Table 5-2 below shows tile correlation between the com- 
ponent scores and the frequencies of passive. Passive forms are 
counted using the pattern matching method proposed by/Ushijima 
1987/. The count is divided by the number of the kutens in a sam- 
ple, yielding the ratio to passives per sentences, o1' sentence- 
endings. 
Japanese passive forms are also used for potentials. For 
example, mirareru may mean either be seen (passive) o1' can see 
(potential) and taberareru may have one of three meanings: be 
eaten, can eat, and can be eaten. Thus, frequent use of passives 
tend to make a doc~ment vague and less readable. 
The second component scores have a higher correlation than 
other component scores. Note that the correlation coefficient is 
negative. This agrees with the observation that the second com- 
ponent score is lower on difficult-to-read texts and that the fre- 
quency of passives i higher on such texts. 
Figure 5-1 shows the plot of the second component scores 
and the frequencies ofpassives per 1000 sentences. The line in the 
figure is the regression line.

6. The Derived Formula 
The results above support he adequacy of the second com- 
ponent as a scale of readability. To summarize, the second com- 
ponent score may be used as a readability index because of the fol- 
lowing facts. 
(1) The component score agrees with human judgement about 
easy/difficult texts. Easier-to-read texts yield higher valued 
scores. 
(2) Introductory materials give higher scores than technical 
papers, 
(3) The score increases as the result of improvement by editing 
of texts, 
(4) The frequencies of passive forms have a negative correlation 
(-0.53) with the component score. 
The first component and the third component do not possess all of 
these properties. Thus the second is a better measure of readability 
than the first or the third. 
The second component score is transformed so that the mean 
on those 77 samples equals 50, the standard eviation equals 10, 
and let the value be higher on easy texts. This yields formula, 
RS = 0.06 xpa  + 0.25 xph - 0.19 xpc  - 0.61 xpk  
-1.34 x Is -1.35 x la + 7.52 x lh - 22.1 ? lc - 5.3 x lk 
-3.87 x cp - 109.1 
where pa, ph, pc,  pk are the percentages of alphabet runs, hira- 
gana runs, kanzi runs, and katakana mns, respectively; Is is the 
average numbers of letters per sentence; la, lh, lc, Ik are the aver- 
age numbers of letters per alphabet run, hiragana run, kanzi run, 
and katakana run, respectively;and cp is the tooten to kuten ratio. 
7. Validation of the Derived Formula 
We have also obtained experimental conformation on the 
idea that the RS is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of read- 
ing, by the cloze procedure/Taylor 1953/,/Shiba 1957/. 
Cloze procedure judges the relative reading difficulty of texts 
to a particular population. This difficulty mostly related to the 
content of the text. Suppose readers have no background 
knowledge of the content. They are not likely to be able to fill a 
blanked-out word where a technical term or some other word that 
requires the knowledge of the area the content belongs to be filled 
in. In such cases, the cloze score or the doze percentage becomes 
low for the text even if an experts finds it very easy to read. 
Stylistic difficulty may be also measured by this procedure, 
according to the experiment of \]Kitao 1960/. In the experiment 
subsequent to the one mentioned in the previous section, he 
required the subjects to perform the cloze procedure on two 
materials; the same text represented in two different ways. One is 
in the usual representation, mixing kanzi and kana; the other is 
written entirely in hiragana. The cloze score of the usual form was 
higher than the one entirely in kana. This result was consistent 
with the result hat the subjects required longer time in reading the 
text entirely in kana, as mentioned in section 2. 
As the cloze procedure scores both the difficulty of style and 
the difficulty of the content, another measure is needed to confirm 
that our formula is a measure of the stylistic readability. For this 
purpose, we recorded the total time each subject ook to complete 
a cloze text. The recorded time was divided by the number of 
blanks, thus converted into the average time taken to fill out one 
blank. 
The process a subject akes to fill out a blank is composed of 
four phases, i.e., 
652 
(1) the phase of reading the incomplete text and understand the 
content of the passage, 
(2) the phase of surmising what is missing (as a notion), 
(3) the phase of choosing the proper word to supplement, and 
(4) the phase of writing down that word. 
The time for writing down a word is fairly constant, unless the 
word contains extremely complicated kanzi. Therefore, the varia- 
tion of time from text to text is the variation of time for the phase 
(1), (2), and (3), i.e., understanding the passage, surmising the 
missing notion, and choosing the proper word. The text which is 
stylistically difficult takes more time in the phase (1). Thus the 
difficult-to-read texts must require more time filling out blanks 
than easy-to-read ones. 
Materials 
The materials of the experiment, denoted by p 1 through p 6, 
were taken from the six sample papers among the 77 used for the 
PCA. Each was about 500 characters in size. Three of them (p 1, 
p 2, p 3) had high RS s (RS > 50) and the three (p 4, p 5, a 6) had 
low RS s (RS < 50). 
Every eighth word of each text was blanked out, i.e., the pro- 
portion of blanked out words to the whole words was 12.5%. Ten 
underscore ('_') characters were put where a word was blanked 
out. Among several different definitions of Japanese words used, 
the one which gives the smallest unit was taken. The materials 
were printed out on a sheet of A4-sized paper, one material per 
paper. 
Twenty-eight subjects (25 undergraduate students and 3 gra- 
duate students) participated in the experiment. Each subject was 
assigned three materials fi~m p 1 -p  6 selected randomly, so that 
the half of the subjects were assigned each material. The subjects 
were required to fill blanks (underscored parts) with words they 
thought most appropriate to the context, taking as much time they 
need. The subjects were told that each word-unit was smallest 
possible, and therefore the deleted part might not match what they 
think is a word. The subjects were also told that the materials that 
they had were independent from each other. 
At the same time, the subjects were required to record the 
time when he/she start to fill out each paper, i.e., one material, and 
when he/she completed, for each paper, to the unit of seconds. 
Results 
Completed sheets, expect for one by a subject who gave up 
the procedure in the middle are analyzed. Whether the word filled 
in matched the original or not was judged according to /Shiba 
1957/. Some sheets are without the record of the time. Such 
sheets are included for calculation of doze pereen\[ages but 
excluded from the analysis of time. The eloze percentages and the 
medians of the time taken to fill a blank are shown in table 7-1. 
The cloze percentages were higher on texts with higher RS, 
although the correlation was not statistically significant (the corre- 
lation coefficient between cloze percentages and RS s is 0.295). 
For the analysis of time taken, the texts were divided into two 
categories; the ones with RS > 50 and the ones with RS < 50. The 
average time for filling a blank was compared between the two 
categories of the texts using the median test. The result is shown 
in table 7-2. The difference of the time for filling a blank is 
shorter on texts with high RS s. 
In addition, we compared a document and its rewritten ver- 
sion by the same procedure. The material r 1 was taken from the 
final report of rinzi-kyouiku-singikai (National Council of Educa- 
tional Reform) of Japanese Government. The document r 1 had an 
extremely low score (RS = 27). The material r2 was rewritten 
from r 1 by di?iding long sentences into shorter sentences and sub- 
stituting Japanese words for words of Chinese origin. The inte.u- 
tion of the rewriting is to increase RS. The RS of the rewritten 
text is 47, nearly the average of the sample texts of PCA (= 5(I). 
The cloze percentage and the average time for fl l ing a blank is 
compm'ed con(pared as above. The cloze percentage of rite rewrit- 
ten version r2 was 59.6 %, higher than that of the original r 1 
(56.6 %). The average time for billing a blank is shorter for the 
rewritten version than for the original (the mexlian was 9.6 sec. for 
r2  and 10.9 see. for r 1). The median test of time eompadug the 
two materials showed that the difference was not statistically 
significant ()~:~ :- 0). 
These ret;ults how that 
(1) the subjects take shorter time with the texts of higher RS in 
understanding and guessing the nfissing words of the text, 
than wilh the text of lower RS, though the result is not statist- 
ieally significant, and that 
(2) the subjt:cts guess the missing words in the high RS texts 
more co~ cectly than those in the low RS texts. 
The difi'erenee il~ time a subjecl spent to fill one blank in the two 
types of texts is significant, by the median test. 
These rcudts did not show that RS is related to the difficulty 
of the content or the vocabulary of the texts, ttowever, RS is 
related to the stylistic difiiculty, that is, RS show the ~vlative 
difficulty of {:mnsfb,mation from the text itself to the content. 
Therefore, RS is judged useful to measure the readability of texts 
in general. 
We judged that the clozc score is more relatexl to the 
difficulty of the content han to the difficulty of the style. There-- 
fore we introduced another measure tbr stylistic difficulty. A com. 
rnent fi'om the experimental subject who gave up the procedure 
coufit'ms on, judgement to be reasonable. Ile gave up |he task 
because he has not enough knowledge of the m'ea of these texts, 
especially, of technical papers. 
g. Concluding Remarks 
We have: derived a readability formula ti'orh the multivariate 
analysis on wtriance of surface characteristics of Japanese techni- 
cal documents intended for adult readers. 
The mean, file minimum, and the maximum v'alue of RS over the 
several types of texts are shown in table 8-.1. 
As with all indices, RS can be increased by revision which 
dues not necessarily enhance readability. For example, if a text is 
written entirely in hiragana and the sentences are cut into short 
shorter ones, lh and ph increases and Is decreases. This revision 
yields greater value of RS but does not produce the text easier to 
read. The formula shmdd be applied to the texts written in the 
common way To construct an index that is sensitive to the unrea- 
dability caused by unusually many ldraganas0 we may neeA a qua? 
dratic formula on hiragana rim length or hiragana run frequencies.
