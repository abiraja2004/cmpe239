Abstract 
In this paper, we describe in brief our 
system for the Second International 
Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff 
sponsored by the ACL-SIGHAN. We 
participated in all tracks at the bakeoff. 
The evaluation results show our system 
can achieve an F measure of 0.940-
0.967 for different testing corpora. 
1 Introduction 
Word segmentation is very important for Chi-
nese text processing, which is aiming at recog-
nizing the implicit word boundaries in plain 
Chinese text. Over the past decades, great pro-
gress has been made with Chinese word 
segmentation technology. However, two 
difficulties still face us while developing a 
practical segmentation system for large open 
applications, i.e. the resolution of ambiguous 
segmentation and the identification of unknown 
or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. 
In order to resolve the above two problems, 
we developed a purely statistical Chinese word 
segmentation system using a two-stage strategy. 
We participated in eight tracks at the Second 
International Chinese Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff sponsored by the ACL-SIGHAN, and 
tested our system on different testing corpora. 
The scored results show that our system is effec-
tive for most of ambiguous segmentation and 
unknown words in Chinese text. In this paper, 
we make a summary of this work and give some 
analysis on the results. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
First in Section 2, we describe in brief a two-
stage strategy for Chinese word segmentation. 
Then in Section 3, we give details about the set-
tings or configuration of our system for different 
testing tracks, particularly the training data and 
the dictionaries used in our system. Finally, we 
report the results of our system at this bakeoff in 
Section 4, and give our conclusions on this work 
in Section 5. 
2 Overview of the System 
In practice, our system works in two major steps 
as follows: 
The first step is a process of known word 
segmentation, which aims to segment an input 
sequence of Chinese characters into a sequence 
of known words that are listed in the system dic-
tionary. In our current system, we apply a 
known word bigram model to perform this task 
(Fu and Luke, 2003; Fu and Luke, 2004; Fu and 
Luke, 2005).  
Actually, known word segmentation is a 
process of disambiguation. Given a Chinese 
character string 
ncccC L21= , there are usually 
multiple possible segmentations of known words 
mwwwW L21=  according to the system diction-
ary. The task of known word segmentation is to 
find a proper segmentation 
mwwwW L21? =  that 
maximizes the probability ?

The second step is actually a tagging task on 
the sequence of known words acquired in the 
first step, which intends to detect unknown 
165
words or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the 
input. In this process, each known word yielded 
in the first step will be further assigned a proper 
tag that indicates whether the known word is an 
independent segmented word by itself or a be-
ginning/middle/ending component of an OOV 
word  (Fu and Luke, 2004). In order to improve 
our system, part-of-speech information is also 
introduced in some tracks such as the PKU open 
test and the AS open test. Furthermore, a 
lexicalized HMM tagger is developed to per-
form this task (Fu and Luke, 2004).  
Given a sequence of known words 
nwwwW L21= , the lexicalized HMM tagger 
attempt to find an appropriate sequence of tags

3 Settings for Different Tracks 
Table 1. Training corpora for different tracks 
Table 1 presents the corpora used to train our 
system for different tracks. In the Academia 
Sinica (AS) open test and the Peking University 
(PKU) open test, our system is trained respec-
tively using the Sinica Corpus (3.0) and the PFR 
Corpus. In all other tests, including all closed 
tests, City University of Hong Kong (CityU) 
open test and Microsoft Research (MSR) open 
test, we trained our system using the relevant 
training corpora provided for the bakeoff.  
Track Training Corpus Word 
counts
AS-O The Sinica Corpus 3.0  5,692,150
AS-C AS corpus for Bakeoff 2005 5,449,698
CityU-O CityU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,455,629
CityU-C CityU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,455,629
MSR-O MSR corpus for Bakeoff 2005 2,368,391
MSR-C MSR corpus for Bakeoff 2005 2,368,391
PKU-O The PFR Corpus  7,286,960
PKU-C PKU corpus for Bakeoff 2005 1,109,947
Table 2 shows all the dictionaries used in our 
system for different tracks.   
In the closed test, the system dictionaries are 
derived automatically from the relevant training 
corpora for this bakeoff by using the following 
three criteria: (1) Each character in the training 
corpus is taken as an independent entry and col-
lected into the relevant system dictionary. (2) A 
standard Chinese word in the training corpus 
will enter to the relevant dictionary if it has four 
or less Chinese characters within it, and at the 
same time, its counts of occurrence in the corpus 
is observed to be larger than a threshold. In our 
current system, the threshold is set to 10 for the 
AS closed test and 5 for other closed tests. (3) 
For non-standard Chinese words such as nu-
meral expressions, English words and punctua-
tions, if they consist of multiple characters, they 
will be not included in the system dictionary. 
As for the open test, some other dictionaries 
are applied. As can be seen from Table 2, the 
CKIP Lexicon and Chinese Grammar is used in 
both AS and CityU open test, and the Gram-
matical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chi-
nese developed by the Peking University is 
utilized in both PKU and MSR open test.

Table 2. System dictionaries for different tracks 
It should be noted that part-of-speech infor-
mation is also utilized in the AS open test and 
the PKU open test, because part-of-speech in-
formation proved to be informative in identify-
ing OOV words in Chinese text (Fu and Luke, 
2004). Therefore, the training corpora for the 
two tests are tagged with part-of-speech, and 
entries in the relevant dictionaries are defined 
with their potential part-of-speech categories.

4 The Scored Results 
In Bakeoff 2005, six measures are employed to 
score the performance of a word segmentation 
system, namely recall (R), precision (P), the 
evenly-weighted F-measure (F), out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) rate for the test corpus, recall 
with respect to OOV words (ROOV) or in-
vocabulary words (Riv).  
In order to achieve a consistent evaluation of 
our system in both the closed test and the open 
test, OOV is defined in this paper as the set of 
words in the test corpus but not occurring in 
both the training corpus and the system diction-
ary. Furthermore, the additional two rates, i.e. 
OOV-C and OOV-D are used to denote the out-
of-vocabulary rate with respect to the training 
corpus and the out-of-vocabulary rate with 
respect to the system dictionary, respectively. At 
the same time, the precision with regard to in-
vocabulary words (Piv) and OOV words (POOV) 
are also computed in this paper to give a more 
complete evalution of our system in unknown 
word identification.

PKU-C 0.944 0.943 0.944 0.961 0.958 0.656 0.700
Table 4. Scores for different tracks 
The OOV rates and scores of our system are 
summarized respectively in Table 3 and Table 4. 
The results show that our system can achieve a 
F-measure of 0.940-0.967 for different testing 
corpora while the relevant OOV rates are from 
0.023 to 0.074.  
Although our system has achieved a promis-
ing performance, there is still much to be done 
to improve it. Firstly, our system is purely statis-
tics-based, it cannot yield correct segmentations 
for all non-standard words (NSWs) such as nu-
meral expressions and English strings in Chi-
nese text. Secondly, known word segmentation 
and unknown word identification are taken as 
two independent stages in our system. This 
strategy is obviously simple and more easily 
applicable (Fu and Luke, 2003). Although the 
known word bigram model can partly resolve 
this problem, it is not always effective for some 
complicated strings that contains a mixture of 
ambiguities and unknown words, such as ?31
? and the fragment ?? in the sen-
tence ?	
?.   
5 Conclusions 
This paper presents a two-stage statistical word 
segmentation system for Chinese. We partici-
pated in all testing tracks at the second Sighan 
bakeoff. The scored results show that our system 
can achieve a F-measure of 0.940-0.967 as a 
whole for different corpora. This indicates that 
the proposed system is effective for most am-
biguous segmentations and unknown words in 
Chinese test. For future work, we hope to im-
prove our system by incorporating some pattern 
rules to handle complicated ambiguous frag-
ments and non-standard words in Chinese text.
