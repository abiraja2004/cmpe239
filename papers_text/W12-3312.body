Abstract
Automatically constructing knowledge bases
from online resources has become a crucial
task in many research areas. Most existing
knowledge bases are built from English re-
sources, while few efforts have been made for
other languages. Building knowledge bases
for Chinese is of great importance on its own
right. However, simply adapting existing tool-
s from English to Chinese yields inferior re-
sults.In this paper, we propose to create Chi-
nese knowledge bases from online resources
with less human involvement.This project will
be formulated in a self-supervised framework
which requires little manual work to extrac-
t knowledge facts from online encyclopedia
resources in a probabilistic view.In addition,
this framework will be able to update the con-
structed knowledge base with knowledge facts
extracted from up-to-date newswire.Currently,
we have obtained encouraging results in our
pilot experiments that extracting knowledge
facts from infoboxes can achieve a high accu-
racy of around 95%, which will be then used
as training data for the extraction of plain web-
pages.
1 Introduction
As the development of world wide web (WWW),
the volume of web data is growing exponentially
in recent years. Most of the data are unstructured,
while a few are manually structured and only a s-
mall part of them are machine-readable. How to
make these data accessible and useable for end user-
s has become a key topic in many research areas,
such as information retrieval, natural language pro-
cessing, semantic web(Tim et al., 2001) and so on.
Among others, constructing knowledge bases (KB)
from web data has been considered as a preliminary
step. However, it is not trivial to extract knowledge
facts from unstructured web data, especially in open
domain, and the accuracy is usually not satisfacto-
ry. On the other hand, with the development of We-
b2.0, there are increasing volume of online encyclo-
pedias which are collectively created by active vol-
unteers, e.g., Wikipedia1. Surprisingly, experiment
evidences show that the confidence of Wikipedia is
even comparable with that of British Encyclopedi-
a (Giles, 2005). Therefore, many efforts have been
made to distill knowledge facts from Wikipedia or
similar resources and further build KBs, for example
YAGO(Suchanek et al., 2007), DBpedia(Bizer et al.,
2009) and KOG(Wu and Weld, 2008).
In the literature, most KBs constructed recently
are in English as it takes up an overwhelming major-
ity on the web, while other major languages receives
less attention, for example, Chinese features similar
amounts of web pages with English yet is less fre-
quently studied with regarding to building KBs. Al-
though continuous works have been made to process
English resources, building Chinese KBs is of great
value on its own. To the best of our knowledge, few
efforts have been made to construct a KB in Chi-
nese until now. Despite of necessary special pre-
processings, e.g., word segmentation, for Chinese,
building a Chinese KB from web data is quite differ-
ent from building English ones, since we have lim-
ited resources available in Chinese that are of lower
1http://www.wikipedia.com
67
quality compared to their English counterparts. This
brings more difficulties than that of English. As a
result, the approaches used in English may not work
well in Chinese.
In this paper, we propose a new framework to
build a KB in Chinese from online resources with-
out much human involvement. Since the Chinese
portion of Wikipedia is much smaller than its En-
glish part, we harvest knowledge facts from a Chi-
nese online encyclopedia, HudongBaike2. Hudong-
Baike is the largest Chinese online encyclopedia and
features similar managing rules and writing styles
with Wikipedia. We first obtain knowledge facts by
parsing the infoboxes of HudongBaike. Then we use
these triples as seeds, and adopt the idea of distant
supervision(Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010;
Yao et al., 2010) to extract more facts from other
HudongBaike articles and build a KB accordingly.
Moreover, to make the knowledge base more up-to-
date, we also propose to propagate the KBwith news
events.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we
first introduce the related work, and briefly introduce
two online encyclopedias. In Section 4 we describe
our framework in detail. Our current work are dis-
cussed in Section 5. In Section 6 we conclude this
paper.
2 Related Work
KB construction is an important task and has at-
tracted many research efforts from artificial intelli-
gence, information retrieval, natural language pro-
cessing, and so on. Traditional KBs are most-
ly manually created, including WordNet(Stark and
Riesenfeld, 1998), Cyc or OpenCyc(Matuszek et al.,
2006), SUMO(Niles and Pease, 2001), and also
some domain-specific ontologies such as GeneOn-
tology3. These KBs achieve a high accuracy since
they are manually built or filtered by domain ex-
perts. However, manually creating KB is a time-
consuming and labor-intensive work, and continu-
ous annotation is required to keep the KB up-to date.
Most of them thus suffers from the coverage issue in
practice.
In recent years, many researchers turn to auto-
2http://www.hudong.com
3http://www.geneontology.org
matically extract knowledge to construct KBs. One
kind of methods extract knowledge facts from gener-
al text corpus. These approaches, such as TextRun-
ner(Banko et al., 2007) and KnowItAll(Etzioni et al.,
2004), use rule based information extraction tech-
nologies to extract relations between entity pairs.
Recently, TextRunner is expanded by a life long
learning strategy, which can acquire new facts. An-
other type of approaches aims to automatically de-
rive facts from online encyclopedias. Collectively
created by many volunteers, online encyclopedias
are more reliable than general web pages. They al-
so contain semi-structured knowledge such as hand-
crafted infoboxes. Therefore, the accuracy of the
facts extracted will be higher. Researchers utilize
these semi-structured data resources for knowledge
extraction, for example, YAGO extract facts from in-
foboxes and category names of Wikipedia, and use
WordNet as its taxonomy(Suchanek et al., 2007).
A similar approach is adopted by DBpedia, which
also extract knowledge facts from infoboxes(Bizer
et al., 2009). Unlike YAGO and DBpedia, Kylin us-
es the infoboxes and the Wikipedia pages containing
these infoboxes to build a training set, and use ma-
chine learning methods to extract facts from plain
Wikipedia articles(Wu and Weld, 2007). Although
Kylin achieves a high precision, it is corpus-specific,
which means it can only be used in Wikipedia-like
corpora. It is noticed that all the above works fo-
cus on building an English KB, and few efforts have
been made in building a Chinese one until now.
3 Online Encyclopedia
Wikipedia is known as an accurate online encyclo-
pedia whose accuracy is comparable with Encyclo-
pedia Britannica(Giles, 2005). It?s created by thou-
sands of volunteers around the whole world. Until
now, the English version ofWikipedia has 3,878,200
content pages, making it the largest English on-
line encyclopedia. The Chinese version contains
402,781 content pages, which is much smaller than
the English version.
HudongBaike is the largest Chinese online ency-
clopedia with over 5 million content pages. Similar-
ly with Wikipedia, HudongBaike is also created by
volunteers, and relies on the community to ensure
its quality. Many HudongBaike pages also contains

summarizes the knowledge of the corresponding en-
tity. The information in the infobox is reliable since
these are collaboratively crafted by many volunteer-
s. Figure 1 is an example page with an infobox from
HudongBaike, introducing a US general ????
?? (George Marshall).
4 The Framework
In this paper, we formulated the KB construction
task in a semi-supervised learning fashion which re-
quires little manual annotation and supports knowl-
edge propagation by up-to-date feeds. Because
the Chinese part of Wikipedia is relatively smal-
l and may suffer from the coverage problem, we use
HudongBaike to build our KB in this project. In fu-
ture we may merge the Wikipedia part into our KB.
After necessary preprocessings including word seg-
mentation and named entity extraction, we are able
to apply our framework shown in Figure 2.
In general, our framework contains the follow-
ing steps: (1)Extracting knowledge from online
encyclopedia; (2)Linking triples and building KB;
(3)Propagating KB with up-to-date data.
4.1 Entity Relation Extraction
Compared to other resources on the Web, online
encyclopedias contain less noises and feature more
regular structures, thus are considered easier for us
to extract knowledge facts.
Analyzing Infoboxes As mentioned before, many
HudongBaike pages contains an infobox, which
has high accuracy and can be used directly for
relation extraction. We can conveniently parse
these infoboxes into < S,P,O > triples. For
example, from the first entry of this infobox,
we can derive the following triple: < ?
????? , ??? , ???? >(<
GeorgeMarshall, BirthP lace, Uniontown >).
The precision of the extraction is over 95%, and
these triples can form a valuable knowledge source.
Extracting relations with Distant Supervision
Extracting knowledge from infoboxes is efficien-
t and can achieve a high precision. However, many
web pages in HudongBaike do not have infoboxes.
There is much richer knowledge in the main arti-
cles of HudongBaike, which we should also take in-
to consideration.
Extracting knowledge from unstructured articles
is a challenging task. Traditionally, researchers
use manually created templates to extract relation-
s. These templates need lots of human efforts and
are domain-specific. Recent methods trend to re-
ly on machine learning models, which need a large
amount of labeled data. One idea is to utilize the
infoboxes to form the training data set, and train an
extractor to extract relations from the pages with-
out an infobox(Wu and Weld, 2007). However, the
relations extracted from a page are restricted to the
infobox template used by the current page catego-
ry, and their subject must be the entity that this page
describes. For example, when we extract relation-
s from the page of ????? (Charles Yeager,
Ace of US in WWII) which does not contain an in-
fobox, the subject of these relations must be Charles
Yeager, and we can only extract the relation types
listed in infobox template for a military person. As
a result, this method can only be used in online en-
cyclopedias in a Wikipedia style, and the recall will
be relatively low.
Distant supervision is widely used in relation ex-
traction in recent years. It hardly need any manual
work, and can overcome the above problems. It can
be used in any reliable corpus, and doesn?t have the
strict restrictions as previous methods. We adopt its
idea in our framework. The basic assumption of dis-
tant supervision is the sentences containing two en-
69
Figure 1: A HudongBaike page about a US general George Marshall
tities should express the relation between them more
or less. It only needs a reliable seed KB (in the form
of relation triples) and a corpus. Here, we can use
the knowledge facts extracted from infoboxes previ-
ously as the seed KB, and the articles of Hudong-
Baike as text corpus. For each triple in the seed K-
B, we generate positive training data by finding sen-
tences containing both its subject and object in the
corpus. For example, we can map the first entry in
Figure 1 to the sentence 1880?12?31?????
??????? (On December 31th, 1880, Mar-
shall was born in Uniontown). The negative training
data can be generated by randomly select some sen-
tences which contain neither of the subject and the
object. A predictive model such as logistic regres-
sion model is trained with the training data. We can
use the model to give predictions for the relations
in a textual knowledge source. For a HudongBaike
page, we should decide the entity pairs we are in-
terested in. A simple strategy is to select all entity
pairs. But it will be time-consuming, and may suffer
from weak-related entity pairs. So we extract top-
ic entities which have high tfidf weights from this
page, and generate entity pairs under the restriction
that they must contain at least one topic entity. For
each entity pair, we find the sentences which contain
both the subject and object and use the predictive
model to give the possible relations between them
and the confidence of the relations.
However, the predictions of distant supervision
is less accurate than those of supervised method-
s. So we should adopt some heuristics to filter the
relations extracted. An easy strategy is to set up a
threshold for relation confidences to avoid uncertain
relations and improve the precision. We adopt this
method in our project. Furthermore, we can also use
the strategies of Riedel et al. (2010) or Yao et al.
(2010).
4.2 Knowledge Base Construction
After the relation extraction, we must link the ex-
tracted knowledge triples in order to construct the
knowledge base. In our scenario this linking task can
be formulated as: given a base KB, a bunch of newly
extracted knowledge triples with the sentences de-
scribing them and their contexts, the task of entity
linking aims to link each of the entity mentions in
the plain texts (these sentences mentioned above) to
its corresponding entity in the base KB. At the very
beginning, we initiate a base KB by using the taxon-
omy of HudongBaike thus are able to map relations
between entities into the KB through entity linking.
In online encyclopedias, the synonyms of an en-
tity are represented by redirect links. Synonyms are
important in entity linking because they provide al-
ternative names for entities, and we may miss some
mappings without them. For example, we have an
entity ?????? (United States of America)
in the KB, and an mention ?? (USA) in a piece
of text. Redirect links can tell us that we can create
a mapping between them. Basically, for each men-
tion, we can find matching candidates for them in a
KB through exact matching. However, if we can-
not find an exact match for a mention, we will try
70
fuzzy matching since a mention may not match ex-
actly with its referent entity in KB.
Now we need to solve the entity linking task. Tra-
ditional methods did not exploit global interdepen-
dence between entity linking decisions. We thus
adopt the collective entity linking approach of Han
et al. (2011) to solve this problem. This method cap-
tures the rich semantic relatedness knowledge be-
tween entities, and take the interdependence of link-
ing decisions into consideration. They construct a
graph by linking name mentions and candidate enti-
ties in pairwise using the semantic relatedness be-
tween them. Then they use a random walk algo-
rithm on the graph to solve the problem. However,
they did not take the NIL problem into considera-
tion. That is, in entity linking, if the referent enti-
ty of an name mention is not in our KB, it should
be linked to a pseudo entity NIL. In our case, we
should abandon the mapping of the current triple by
deciding whether this entity has been listed in the
KB(Zheng et al., 2010).
4.3 Knowledge base Propagation
Although we can extract millions of relations and
built a KB in previous subsections, it has the same
shortage as most existing KBs: the knowledge ex-
tracted are mostly statical attributes of entities (such
as birthdate or occupation of a person) and can not
describe the latest updates of an entity (such as a
politician is currently visiting a country).
In order to settle this problem, we use the dy-
namical knowledge extracted from up-to-date data
to expand our KB. One possible solution is extract-
ing semantic event elements from online news. In
this project, we will synchronies our KB with a Chi-
nese newspaper, RenMinRiBao (People?s Daily).
5 Current Work
Currently, we have extracted triples from the in-
foboxes of HudongBaike and built the base KB.
Manual evaluation shows that the precision of struc-
tured content extraction is over 95%. Most errors
are caused by the web page?s own mistakes or edit-
ing errors in infoboxes.
To assess the quality of HudongBaike data, in our
preliminary experiments(Yidong et al., 2012), we
extract relation facts from plain HudongBaike arti-
cles without infoboxes in a way similar to Kylin. We
focus on three categories, including ?? (Nation),
?? (Person) and ?? (Actor or Actress). In each
category we select several representative attributes
from its infobox template. We manually annotated
more than 200 testing examples for evaluation: 100
in Person, 33 in Nation and 91 in Actor or Actress.
The results shows that the HudongBaike data can be
used to extract knowledge facts with a high precision
in all three categories: in ?? the average precision
is 79.43%, in ?? it is 78.9%, and in ?? it even
goes up to 90.8%.
Distant Supervision We further adopt the ap-
proach of distant supervision(Mintz et al., 2009) in
a Chinese dataset. We generate a dataset from Ren-
MinRiBao with 10000 sentences, and each sentence
contains at least a pair of entities which correspond
to a knowledge triple in HudongBaike?s infobox ex-
traction. We use 60% of the sentences as training
set and 40% as the testing set. Our experiments
show that when the recall is 10%, we can obtain a
high precision of 87%, which indicates the feasibili-
ty of our model. However, as the recall raises, the
precision drops dramatically. For example, when
the recall is 29% the precision is about 65%. This
can be remedied by adopting more encyclopedia-
specific filtering strategies and assumptions during
the distant supervision modeling.
6 Conclusions
In this project, we proposed a framework to build
KBs in Chinese. It uses the infoboxes of Hudong-
Baike as a seed knowledge base, the articles of
HudongBaike as extra textual resources, adopts the
idea of distant supervision to extract knowledge fact-
s from unstructured data and link the triples to build
a knowledge base. This framework requires lit-
tle manual work, and can be used in other reliable
knowledge resources. Our preliminary experimental
results are encouraging, showing that the Hudong-
Baike provides reasonable resources for building
knowledge bases and the distant supervision fashion
can be adapted to work well in Chinese.
For the next, we will further adapt our frame-
work into a self-training manner. By using higher
threshold for confidence in distant supervision we
can make sure the precision of extracted knowledge
71
is high enough for bootstrapping. Then we put the
extracted knowledge facts into the seed KB, and the
framework will repeat iteratively. On the other hand,
we can extract knowledge facts from other reliable
knowledge resource, such as Wikipedia, academic
literature, and merge knowledge from different re-
sources into one KB. Moreover, we can also make
our KB multilingual by adopting our framework in
other languages.
