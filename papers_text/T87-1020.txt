I don't feel comfortable trying to building reliable, well-understood NLP systems 
without providing a semantics for their "mental state," including the data structures 
they encode. One step in that direction is a semantics of sentences, for example that 
of Montague. However, to handle extended discourses, the methods of 
model-theoretic semantics need to be extended in (at least) three directions. First, 
anaphora nd deixis require that the interpretation (of phrases, sentences, and entire 
discourses) should be made sensitive to context, both linguistic and physical. Second, 
non-declarative s ntences must be treated uniformly with declarative ones. Finally, 
it should be possible to make room in the semantics for interpretation constraints 
based on the subject-matter of the discourse and on communication itself. I'm 
thinking particularly of the kind of inferences typically captured computationally b  
the use of scripts, plans, prototypes, etc. Typically these constraints on 
interpretations have been kept outside the realm of semantics, and might even be 
taken .to be the distinguishing characteristics of a separate pragrnatics component. 
I'd like to suggest hat we already have available many of the necessary elements for 
a context-sensitive theory of discourse, although substantial work still needs to be 
done to bring the pieces together and to build implementations faithful to the 
semantics. 
Several proposals have now been made to account for possible relations between 
anaphora nd antecedents within and across sentences, including treatments of the 
interaction between quantifiers and anaphors \[W, K, H, B\]. Kamp and Heim both 
introduce an intermediate l v.,el of representation f sentences and give a semantics to 
that level while Barwise's syntax-directed interpretation relation also takes as 
arguments input and output contexts which are partial assignments of values to 
variables. However, none of these treatments takes into consideration the domain 
constraints, perhaps better described as preferences, or those discussed by Grosz et 
al. \[G\] under the name ofcentering. 
I used to think of the interpretation ofnon-declarative s ntences as being outside the 
domain of semantics; it wasn't clear how semantics was compatible with the 
attribution of illocutionary force (or speech act type) to utterances. But a uniform 
semantics for different sentence types is possible if one takes the interpretation ofan 
utterance (of any number of sentences) to be a relation, determined by mood, 
95 
intonation, and propositional contet~t, between the joint mental state of the 
participants before and after the utterance. The speech acts (illocutionary and 
perlocutionary) applicable to the utterance are then determinable asa function of the 
initial mental state of the speaker (in the case ofillocutionary acts, such as assert and 
warn) or of both initial and final mental states ofspeaker and hearer (in the case of 
perlocutionary acts, such as conoince and scare). The beginning of such an analysis 
can be found in \[PJ. There are other good reasons for this move. It treats utterances 
as first-class actions, making it possible to use them in complex actions including 
non-linguistic acts. It also makes it easier to show the relation between illocutionary 
acts and the related intended periocutionary effects. It also makes it possible to show 
what are the consequences of utterances which, intentionally or not, violate the 
normal conventions, as is the case with ironical, indirect and insincere utterances. 
The key feature of the analysis is its dependence on default rules, formulated within 
Reiter's non-monotonic default logic \[R\]. to express the consequences of utterances, 
making clear that the conveyance of propositional ttitudes constituting a speech act 
is based on the use of utterances with certain features in mental states appropriate to
the attitudes being conveyed, but that, in general, the speaker need not be in the 
requisite mental state. 
Several other discourse constraints have been studied in the framework of various 
non-monotonic logics (e.g., presupposition \[M\], anaphora resolu.tion \[D\], 
conversational implicature \[d\].) So have questions with obvious relation to.discourse 
such as plan .recognition \[KA\] and temporal reasoning IS, L\]... Script-based 
reasoning should allow the defeasible inference of the existence'of various entities, 
including events, from the statement ofthe existence of related entities. 
Although non-monotonic reasoning seems to hold the key to a wide range ofdiscourse 
phenomena, the developments above appeal to a range of different systems: in fact, 
no two of the papers mentioned above use exactly the same system. One promising 
area of unification of the various ystems is through their use of preferred models. It 
may be useful to start with a familiar case. In Montague grammar (based on 
intensional logic, a monotonic system), it is possible to specify constraints on lexical 
items (e.g. the fact that seek is equivalent to try to find, or that the subject of seek, is 
extensional, or human) in a set of meaning postulates. These postulates are used to 
restrict he class of models considered: a sentence s is valid iffit is true in all models 
satisfying the meaning postulates. Similarly, various non-monotonic theories are 
given semantics by restricting the models in which they are interpreted. McCarthy's 
circumscription, for example, makes use of models in which certain predicates are 
restricted to their smallest extensions; Shoham's logic of chronological ignorance 
depends on what he calls chronologically maximally ignorant models, and Kautz's 
logic ofplans minimises over several dimensions, including, e.g., the number of steps 
in a plan.

The whole area of non-monotonic reasoning is in a state of great flux, in part because 
of the diversity of systems and the technical difficulty of arguments within and 
between the various systems \[HM\]. Nevertheless, the simple fact that no other 
approach comes close to dealing with so many of the relevant problems uggests to me 
that three questions hould be investigated on the way to a semantic theory of 
discourse: 
? whether other "pragmatic" problems can be couched in the same terms (e.g., 
noun-noun modification, metonymy, word-sense selection), 
? whether there is a general enough notion of preference to cover all these 
cases, 
? whether a positive answer to these questions can be translated into 
processing algorithms. 
Maybe we'll know the answers at the next meeting.
