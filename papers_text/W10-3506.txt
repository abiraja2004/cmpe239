Abstract
Keyword-matching systems based on
simple models of semantic relatedness
are inadequate at modelling the ambigu-
ities in natural language text, and cannot
reliably address the increasingly com-
plex information needs of users. In
this paper we propose novel methods
for computing semantic relatedness by
spreading activation energy over the hy-
perlink structure of Wikipedia. We
demonstrate that our techniques can
approach state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the
background data.
1 Introduction
The volume of information available to users
on the World Wide Web is growing at an
exponential rate (Lyman and Varian, 2003).
Current keyword-matching information retrieval
(IR) systems suffer from several limitations,
most notably an inability to accurately model
the ambiguities in natural language, such as syn-
onymy (different words having the same mean-
ing) and polysemy (one word having multiple
different meanings), which is largely governed
by the context in which a word appears (Metzler
and Croft, 2006).
In recent years, much research attention has
therefore been given to semantic techniques of
information retrieval. Such systems allow for
sophisticated semantic search, however, require
the use of a more difficult-to-understand query-
syntax (Tran et al, 2008). Furthermore, these
methods require specially encoded (and thus
costly) ontologies to describe the particular do-
main knowledge in which the system operates,
and the specific interrelations of concepts within
that domain.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of
computationally estimating similarity or related-
ness between two natural-language documents.
A novel technique is proposed for comput-
ing semantic similarity by spreading activation
over the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia, the
largest free online encyclopaedia. New mea-
sures for computing similarity between individ-
ual concepts (inter-concept similarity, such as
?France? and ?Great Britain?), as well as be-
tween documents (inter-document similarity)
are proposed and tested. It will be demonstrated
that the proposed techniques can achieve compa-
rable inter-concept and inter-document similar-
ity accuracy on similar datasets as compared to
the current state of the art Wikipedia Link-based
Measure (WLM) (Witten and Milne, 2008) and
Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007) methods respectively.
Our methods outperform WLM in computing
inter-concept similarity, and match ESA for
inter-document similarity. Furthermore, we use
the same background data as for WLM, which is
less than 10% of the data required for ESA.
In the following sections we introduce work
related to our work and an overview of our
approach and the problems that have to be
solved. We then discuss our method in detail and
present several experiments to test and compare
it against other state-of-the-art methods.

2 Related Work and Overview
Although Spreading Activation (SA) is foremost
a cognitive theory modelling semantic mem-
ory (Collins and Loftus, 1975), it has been ap-
plied computationally to IR with various lev-
els of success (Preece, 1982), with the biggest
hurdle in this regard the cost of creating an as-
sociative network or knowledge base with ad-
equate conceptual coverage (Crestani, 1997).
Recent knowledge-based methods for comput-
ing semantic similarity between texts based on
Wikipedia, such as Wikipedia Link-based Mea-
sure (WLM) (Witten and Milne, 2008) and Ex-
plicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007), have been found to out-
perform earlier WordNet-based methods (Bu-
danitsky and Hirst, 2001), arguably due to
Wikipedia?s larger conceptual coverage.
WLM treats the anchor text in Wikipedia arti-
cles as links to other articles (all links are treated
equally), and compare concepts based on how
much overlap exists in the out-links of the arti-
cles representing them. ESA discards the link
structure and uses only the text in articles to de-
rive an explicit concept space in which each di-
mension represents one article/concept. Text is
categorised as vectors in this concept space and
similarity is computed as the cosine similarity of
their ESA vectors. The most similar work to ours
is Yeh (2009) in which the authors derive a graph
structure from the inter-article links in Wikipedia
pages, and then perform random walks over the
graph to compute relatedness.
In Wikipedia, users create links between arti-
cles which are seen to be related to some degree.
Since links relate one article to its neighbours,
and by extension to their neighbours, we ex-
tract and process this hyperlink structure (using
SA) as an Associative Network (AN) (Berger
et al, 2004) of concepts and links relating them
to one another. The SA algorithm can briefly
be described as an iterative process of propagat-
ing real-valued energy from one or more source
nodes, via weighted links over an associative net-
work (each such a propagation is called a pulse).
The algorithm consists of two steps: First, one
or more pulses are triggered, and second, ter-
mination checks determine whether the process
should continue or halt. This process of acti-
vating more and more nodes in the network and
checking for termination conditions are repeated
pulse after pulse, until all termination conditions
are met, which results in a final activation state
for the network. These final node activations
are then translated into a score of relatedness be-
tween the initial nodes.
Our work presents a computational imple-
mentation of SA over the Wikipedia graph.
We therefore overcome the cost of produc-
ing a knowledge base of adequate coverage by
utilising the collaboratively-created knowledge
source Wikipedia. However, additional strate-
gies are required for translating the hyperlink
structure of Wikipedia into a suitable associative
network format, and for this new techniques are
proposed and tested.
3 Extracting the Hyperlink Graph
Structure
One article in Wikipedia covers one specific
topic (concept) in detail. Hyperlinks link a page
A to a page B, and are thus directed. We
can model Wikipedia?s hyperlink structure us-
ing standard graph theory as a directed graph G,
consisting of a set of vertices V, and a set of
edges E. Each edge eij ? E connects two ver-
tices vi, vj ? V. For consistency, we use the
term node to refer to a vertex (Wikipedia article)
in the graph, and link to refer to an edge (hyper-
link) between such nodes.
In this model, each Wikipedia article is seen
to represent a single concept, and the hyperlink
structure relates these concepts to one another. In
order to compute relatedness between two con-
cepts vi and vj , we use spreading activation and
rely on the fundamental principle of an associa-
tive network, namely that it connects nodes that
are associated with one another via real-valued
links denoting how strongly the objects are re-
lated. Since Wikipedia was not created as an as-
sociative network, but primarily as an online en-
cyclopaedia, none of these weights exist, and we
will have to deduce these (see Fan-out constraint
in Section 4).
47
Links into pages are used, since this leads to
better results (Witten and Milne, 2008). The
Wikipedia graph structure is represented in an
adjacency list structure, i.e. for each node vi we
store its list of neighbour nodes in a dictionary
using vi?s id as key. This approach is preferred
over an adjacency matrix structure, since most
articles are linked to by only 34 articles on aver-
age, which would lead to a very sparse adjacency
matrix structure.
4 Adapting Spreading Activation for
Wikipedia?s Hyperlink Structure
Each pulse in the Spreading Activation (SA) pro-
cess consists of three stages: 1) pre-adjustment,
2) spreading, and 3) post-adjustment (Crestani,
1997). During pre- and post-adjustment, some
form of activation decay is optionally applied to
the active nodes. This serves both to avoid re-
tention of activation from previous pulses, and,
from a connectionist point of view, models ?loss
of interest? when nodes are not continually acti-
vated.
Let ai,in denote the total energy input (acti-
vation) for node vi, and N(vi) the set of vi?s
neighbour nodes with incoming links to vi. Also,
let aj,out denote the output activation of a node
vj connected to node vi, and let wij denote the
weight of connection between node vi and vj .
For a node vi, we can then describe the pure
model of spreading activation as follows:
ai,in =
?
vj?N(vi)
aj,outwij . (1)
This pure model of SA has several significant
problems, the most notable being that activation
can saturate the entire network unless certain
constraints are imposed, namely limiting how
far activation can spread from the initially acti-
vated nodes (distance constraint), and limiting
the effect of very highly-connected nodes (fan-
out constraint) (Crestani, 1997). In the following
three sections we discuss how these constraints
were implemented in our model for SA.
Distance constraint
For every pulse in the spreading process, a
node?s activation value is multiplied by a global
network decay parameter 0 < d < 1. We
therefore substitute wij in Equation 1 for wijd.
This decays activation exponentially in the path
length. For a path length of one, activation is de-
cayed by d, for a path length of two, activation
is decays by dd = d2, etc. This penalises activa-
tion transfer over longer paths. We also include
a maximum path length parameter Lp,max which
limits how far activation can spread.
Fan-out constraint
As noted above, in an associative network, links
have associated real-valued weights to denote the
strength of association between the two nodes
they connect (i.e. wij in Equation 1). These
weights have to be estimated for the Wikipedia
hyperlink graph, and for this purpose we propose
the use of three weighting schemes:
In pure Energy Distribution (ED), a node
vi?s weight w is made inversely proportional to
its in-degree (number of neighbours N(vi) ? 1
with incoming links to vi1). Thus ED(vi, vj) =
wij = 1|N(vi)| . This reduces the effect of veryconnected nodes on the spreading process (con-
straint 2 above).
For instance, we consider a path connecting
two nodes via a general article such as USA (con-
nected to 322,000 articles) not nearly as indica-
tive of a semantic relationship, as a path con-
necting them via a very specific concept, such
as Hair Pin (only connected to 20 articles).
Inverse Link-Frequency (ILF) is inspired by
the term-frequency inverse document-frequency
(tf-idf) heuristic (Salton and McGill, 1983) in
which a term?s weight is reduced as it is con-
tained in more documents in the corpus. It is
based on the idea that the more a term appears
in documents across the corpus, the less it can
discriminate any one of those documents.
We define a node vi?s link-frequency as the
number of nodes that vi is connected to |N(vi)|
divided by the number of possible nodes it could
be connected to in the entire Wikipedia graph
1All orphan nodes are removed from the AN.

|G|, and therefore give the log-smoothed inverse
link-frequency of node vi as:
ILF(vi) , log
( |G|
|N(vi)|
)
? 0 (2)
As noted above for pure energy distribution, we
consider less connected nodes as more specific.
If one node connects to another via a very spe-
cific node with a low in-degree, |G||N(vi)| is verylarge and ILF(vi) > 1, thus boosting that spe-
cific link?s weight. This has the effect of ?boost-
ing? paths (increasing their contribution) which
contain nodes that are less connected, and there-
fore more meaningful in our model.
To evaluate the effect of this boosting ef-
fect described above, we also define a third
normalised weighting scheme called the Nor-
malised Inverse Link-Frequency (NILF), 0 ?
NILF(vi) ? 1:
NILF(vi) , ILF(vi)log |G| . (3)
ILF reaches a maximum of log |G| when
|N(vi)| = 1 (see Equation 2). We therefore di-
vide by log |G| to normalise its range to [0,1].
Threshold constraint
Finally, the above-mentioned constraints are en-
forced through the use of a threshold parameter
0 < T < 1. Activation transfer to a next node
ceases when a node?s activation value drops be-
low a certain threshold T .
5 Strategies for Interpreting
Activations
After spreading has ceased, we are left with a
vector of nodes and their respective values of
activation (an activation vector). We wish to
translate this activation vector into a score re-
sembling strength of association or relatedness
between the two initial nodes.
We approach this problem using two differ-
ent approaches, the Target Activation Approach
(TAA) and the Agglomerative Approach (AA).
These approaches are based on two distinct hy-
potheses, namely: Relatedness between two
nodes can be measured as either 1) the ratio of
initial energy that reaches the target node, or 2)
the amount of overlap between their individual
activation vectors by spreading from both nodes
individually.
Target Activation Approach (TAA)
To measure the relatedness between vi and vj ,
we set ai to some initial valueKinit (usually 1.0),
and all node activations including aj = 0. Af-
ter the SA process has terminated, vj is activated
with some aj,in. Relatedness is computed as the
ratio simTAA(vi, vj) , aj,inKinit .
Agglomerative Approach (AA)
The second approach is called the Agglomera-
tive Approach since we agglomerate all activa-
tions into one score resembling relatedness. Af-
ter spreading has terminated, relatedness is com-
puted as the amount of overlap between the indi-
vidual nodes? activation vectors, using either the
cosine similarity (AA-cos), or an adapted ver-
sion of the information theory based WLM (Wit-
ten and Milne, 2008) measure.
Assume the same set of initial nodes vi and
vj . Let Ak be the N -dimensional vector of real-
valued activation values obtained by spreading
over the N nodes in the graph from node vk
(called an activation vector). We use akx to de-
note the element at position x in Ak. Further-
more, let Vk = {vk1, ..., vkM} denote the set of
M nodes activated by spreading from vk, i.e. the
set of identifiers of nodes with non-zero activa-
tions in Ak after spreading has terminated (and
therefore M ? N ).
We then define the cosine Agglomerative Ap-
proach (henceforth called AA-cos) as
simAA,cos(Ai,Aj)
, Ai ?Aj||Ai||||Aj || (4)
For our adaptation of the Wikipedia Link-based
Measure (WLM) approach to spreading activa-
tion, we define the WLM Agglomerative Ap-
proach (henceforth called AA-wlm2) as
2AA-wlm is our adaptation of WLM (Witten and Milne,
2008) for SA, not to be confused with their method, which
we simply call WLM.
49
simAA,wlm(Vi,Vj)
, log(max(|Vi|,|Vj|))?log(|Vi?Vj|)log(|G|)?log(min(|Vi|,|Vj|)) (5)
with |G| representing the number of nodes in the
entire Wikipedia hyperlink graph. Note that the
AA-wlm method does not take activations into
account, while the AA-cos method does.
6 Spreading Activation Algorithm
Both the TAA and AA approaches described
above rely on a function to spread activation
from one node to all its neighbours, and itera-
tively to all their neighbours, subject to the con-
straints listed. TAA stops at this point and com-
putes relatedness as the ratio of energy received
to energy sent between the target and source
node respectively. However, AA repeats the pro-
cess from the target node and computes related-
ness as some function (cosine or information the-
ory based) of the two activation vectors, as given
by Equation 4 and Equation 5.
We therefore define SPREAD UNIDIR() as
shown in Algorithm 1. Prior to spreading from
some node vi, its activation value ai is set to
some initial activation value Kinit (usually 1.0).
The activation vector A is a dynamic node-
value-pair list, updated in-place. P is a dynamic
list of nodes in the path to vi to avoid cycles.
7 Parameter Optimisation:
Inter-concept Similarity
The model for SA as introduced in this paper re-
lies on several important parameters, namely the
spreading strategy (TAA, AA-cos, or AA-wlm),
weighting scheme (pure ED, ILF, and NILF),
maximum path length Lp,max, network decay d,
and threshold T . These parameters have a large
influence on the accuracy of the proposed tech-
nique, and therefore need to be optimised.
Experimental Method
In order to compare our method with results re-
ported by Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007)
and Witten and Milne (2008), we followed
the same approach by randomly selecting

ing global decay d, and threshold T , given an
adjacency list graph structure G and a weighting
scheme W such that 0 < wij ?W < 1.

50 word-pairs from the WordSimilarity-353
dataset (Gabrilovich, 2002) and correlating
our method?s scores with the human-assigned
scores. To reduce the possibility of overestimat-
ing the performance of our technique on a sam-
ple set that happens to be favourable to our tech-
nique, we furthermore implemented a technique
of repeated holdout (Witten and Frank, 2005):
Given a sample test set of N pairs of words
with human-assigned ratings of relatedness, ran-
domly divide this set into k parts of roughly
equal size3. Hold out one part of the data and
iteratively evaluate the performance of the algo-
rithm on the remaining k?1 parts until all k parts
have been held out once. Finally, average the al-
gorithm?s performance over all k runs into one
score resembling the performance for that set of
parameters.
Since there are five parameters (spreading
strategy, weighting scheme, path length, network
decay, and threshold), a grid search was imple-
mented by holding three of the five parameters
constant, and evaluating combinations of decay
and threshold by stepping over the possible pa-
rameter space using some step size. A coarse-
grained grid search was first conducted with step
3k was chosen as 5.

T , thus T = {0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, ..., 10?9}. The
best values for d and T were then chosen to con-
duct a finer-grained grid search.
Influence of the different Parameters
The spreading strategy determines how activa-
tions resulting from the spreading process are
converted into scores of relatedness or similar-
ity between two nodes. Table 1 summarises the
best results obtained for each of the three strate-
gies, with the specific set of parameters that were
used in each run.
Results are better using the AA (?max =
0.70 for AA-cos) than using the TAA (?max =
0.56). Secondly, the AA-cos spreading strat-
egy significantly outperforms the AA-wlm strat-
egy over this sample set (?max,wlm = 0.60
vs ?max,cos = 0.70). These results compare
favourably to similar inter-concept results re-
ported for WLM (Witten and Milne, 2008) (? =
0.69) and ESA (Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2007) (? = 0.75).
Maximum path length Lp,max is related to
how far one node can spread its activation in the
network. We extend the first-order link model
used by WLM, by approaching the link structure
as an associative network and by using spreading
activation.
To evaluate if this is a useful approach, tests
were conducted by using maximum path lengths
of one, two, and three. Table 2 summarises
the results for this experiment. Increasing path
length from one to two hops increases per-
formance from ?max = 0.47 to ?max =

ILF 0.70 AA-cos, Lp,max = 3, d=0.5, T=0.1
0.66. Moreover, increasing Lp,max from two to
three hops furthermore increases performance to
?max = 0.70.
In an associative network, each link has a
real-valued weight denoting the strength of as-
sociation between the two nodes it connects.
The derived Wikipedia hyperlink graph lacks
these weights. We therefore proposed three new
weighting schemes (pure ED, ILF, and NILF) to
estimate these weights.
Table 3 summarises the best performances us-
ing the different weighting schemes. ILF outper-
forms both ED and NILF. Furthermore, both ED
and NILF perform best using higher decay val-
ues (both 0.9) and lower threshold values (both
0.01), compared to ILF (0.5 and 0.1 respectively
for d and T ). We attribute this observation to
the boosting effect of the ILF weighting scheme
for less connected nodes, and offer the following
explanation:
Recall from the section on ILF that in our
model, strongly connected nodes are viewed as
more general, and nodes with low in-degrees
are seen as very specific concepts. We argued
that a path connecting two concepts via these
more specific concepts are more indicative of
a stronger semantic relationship than through
some very general concept. In the ILF weighting
scheme, paths containing these less connected
nodes are automatically boosted to be more im-
51
portant. Therefore, by not boosting less mean-
ingful paths, a lower decay and higher threshold
effectively limits the amount of non-important
nodes that are activated, since their activations
are more quickly decayed, whilst at the same
time requiring a higher threshold to continue
spreading. Boosting more important nodes can
therefore lead to activation vectors which capture
the semantic context of the source nodes more
accurately, leading to higher performance.
8 Computing document similarity
To compute document similarity, we first extract
key representative Wikipedia concepts from a
document to produce document concept vec-
tors4. This process is known as wikifica-
tion (Csomai and Mihalcea, 2008), and we used
an implementation of Milne and Witten (2008).
This produces document concept vectors of the
form Vi = {(id1, w1), (id2, w2), ...} with idi
some Wikipedia article identifier andwi a weight
denoting how strongly the concept relates to the
current document. We next present two algo-
rithms, MAXSIM and WIKISPREAD, for com-
puting document similarity, and test these over
the Lee (2005) document similarity dataset, a
set of 50 documents between 51 and 126 words
each, with the averaged gold standard similarity
ratings produced by 83 test subjects (see (Lee et
al., 2005)).
The first metric we propose is called
MAXSIM (see Algorithm 2) and is based on
the idea of measuring document similarity by
pairing up each Wikipedia concept in one docu-
ment?s concept vector with its most similar con-
cept in the other document. We average those
similarities to produce an inter-document simi-
larity score, weighted by how strongly each con-
cept is seen to represent a document (0 < pi <
1). The contribution of a concept is further
weighted by its ILF score, so that more specific
concepts contribute more to final relatedness.
The second document similarity metric we
propose is called the WIKISPREAD method and
is a natural extension of the inter-concept spread-
4Vectors of Wikipedia topics (concepts) and how
strongly they are seen to relate to the current document.

ing activation work introduced in the previous
section. We view a document concept vector as
a cluster of concepts, and build a single docu-
ment activation vector (see Algorithm 3) ? i.e. a
vector of article ids and their respective activa-
tions ? for each document, by iteratively spread-
ing from each concept in the document concept
vector. Finally, similarity is computed using ei-
ther the AA-cos or AA-wlm methods given by
Equation 4 and Equation 5 respectively.
Knowledge-based approaches such as the
Wikipedia-based methods can capture more
complex lexical and semantic relationships than

Combined (Cosine + MaxSim) 0.72
keyword-matching approaches, however, noth-
ing can be said about concepts not adequately
represented in the underlying knowledge base
(Wikipedia). We therefore hypothesise that com-
bining the two approaches will lead to more ro-
bust document similarity performance. There-
fore, the final document similarity metric we
evaluate (COMBINED) is a linear combination
of the best-performing Wikipedia-based meth-
ods described above, and the well-known Vector
Space Model (VSM) with cosine similarity and
tf-idf (Salton and McGill, 1983).
Results
The results obtained on the Lee (2005) document
similarity dataset using the three document sim-
ilarity metrics (MAXSIM, WIKISPREAD, and
COMBINED) are summarised in Table 4. Of
the two Wikipedia-only methods, the MaxSim
method achieves the best correlation score of
? = 0.68. By combining the standard co-
sine VSM with tf-idf with the MaxSim metric
in the ratio ? and (1 ? ?) for 0 < ? < 1,
and performing a parameter sweep over ?, we
can weight the contributions made by the indi-
vidual methods and observe the effect this has
on final performance. The results are shown
in Fig 1. Note that both methods contribute
equally (? = 0.5) to the final best correlation
score of ? = 0.72. This suggests that selective
knowledge-based augmentation of simple VSM
methods can lead to more accurate document
similarity performance.

9 Conclusion
In this paper, the problem of computing con-
ceptual similarity between concepts and docu-
ments are approached by spreading activation
over Wikipedia?s hyperlink graph. New strate-
gies are required to infer weights of associa-
tion between articles, and for this we introduce
and test three new weighting schemes and find
our Inverse Link-Frequency (ILF) to give best
results. Strategies are also required for trans-
lating resulting activations into scores of relat-
edness, and for this we propose and test three
new strategies, and find that our cosine Agglom-
erative Approach gives best results. For com-
puting document similarity, we propose and test
two new methods using only Wikipedia. Finally,
we show that using our best Wikipedia-based
method to augment the cosine VSM method us-
ing tf-idf, leads to the best results. The final
result of ? = 0.72 is equal to that reported
for ESA (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007),
while requiring less than 10% of the Wikipedia
database required for ESA. Table 4 summarises
the document-similarity results.
