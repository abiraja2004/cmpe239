Abstract
We present a set of new measures designed
to reveal latent information of language
use in children at the lexico-syntactic
level. We used these metrics to analyze
linguistic patterns in spontaneous narra-
tives from children developing typically
and children identified as having a lan-
guage impairment. We observed signif-
icant differences in the z-scores of both
populations for most of the metrics. These
findings suggest we can use these metrics
to aid in the task of language assessment
in children.
1 Introduction
The analysis of spontaneous language samples is
an important task across a variety of fields. For in-
stance, in language assessment this task can help
to extract information regarding language profi-
ciency (e.g. is the child typically developing or
language impaired). In second language acqui-
sition, language samples can help determine if
a child?s proficiency is similar to that of native
speakers.
In recent years, we have started seeing a grow-
ing interest in the exploration of NLP techniques
for the analysis of language samples in the clinical
setting. For example, Sahakian and Snyder (2012)
propose a set of linguistic measures for age pre-
diction in children that combines three traditional
measures from language assessment with a set of
five data-driven measures from language samples
of 7 children. A common theme in this emerg-
ing line of research is the study of the syntax in
those language samples. For instance, to annotate
data to be used in the study of language develop-
ment (Sagae et al, 2005), or to build models to
map utterances to their meaning, similar to what
children do during the language acquisition stage
(Kwiatkowski et al, 2012). In addition, language
samples are also used for neurological assessment,
as for example in (Roark et al, 2007; Roark et
al., 2011) where they explored features such as
Yngve and Frazier scores, together with features
derived from automated parse trees to model syn-
tactic complexity and surprisal. Similar features
are used in the classification of language samples
to discriminate between children developing typ-
ically and children suffering from autism or lan-
guage impairment (Prud?hommeaux et al, 2011).
In a similar line of research, machine learning and
features inspired by NLP have been explored for
the prediction of language status in bilingual chil-
dren (Gabani et al, 2009; Solorio et al, 2011).
More recent work has looked at the feasibility of
scoring coherence in story narratives (Hassanali et
al., 2012a) and also on the inclusion of coherence
89
as an additional feature to boost prediction accu-
racy of language status (Hassanali et al, 2012b).
The contribution of our work consists on new
metrics based on n-grams of Part of Speech (POS)
tags for assessing language development in chil-
dren that combine information at the lexical and
syntactic levels. These metrics are designed to
capture the lexical variability of specific syntac-
tic constructions and thus could help to describe
the level of language maturity in children. For in-
stance, given two lists of examples of the use of
determiner + noun: ?the dog, the frog, the tree?
and ?this dog, a frog, these trees? we want to be
able to say that the second one has more lexical
variability than the first one for that grammatical
pattern.
Our approach to compute these new metrics
does not require any special treatment on the tran-
scripts or special purpose parsers beyond a POS
tagger. On the contrary, we provide a set of mea-
sures that in addition to being easy to interpret by
practitioners, are also easy to compute.
2 Background and Motivation
To establish language proficiency, clinical re-
searchers and practitioners rely on a variety of
measures, such as number of different words,
type-token ratio, distribution of part-of-speech
tags, and mean length of sentences and words per
minute (Lu, 2012; Yoon and Bhat, 2012; Chen and
Zechner, 2011; Yang, 2011; Miller et al, 2006), to
name a few. Most of these metrics can be cate-
gorized as low-level metrics since they only con-
sider rates of different characteristics at the lexi-
cal level. These measures are helpful in the so-
lution of several problems, for example, building
automatic scoring models to evaluate non-native
speech (Chen and Zechner, 2011). They can also
be used as predictors of the rate of growth of En-
glish acquisition in specific populations, for in-
stance, in typically developing (TD) and language
impaired (LI) bilingual children (Rojas and Igle-
sias, 2012; Gutie?rrez-Clellen et al, 2012). Among
the most widely used metrics are mean length of
utterance (MLU), a measure of syntactic complex-
ity (Bedore et al, 2010), and measures of lexi-
cal productivity, such as the number of different
words (NDW) and the child?s ratio of functional
words to content words (F/C) (Sahakian and Sny-
der, 2012).
MLU, NDW, F/C and some other low-level
measures have demonstrated to be valuable in the
assessment of language ability considering that
practitioners often only need to focus on produc-
tivity, diversity of vocabulary, and sentence or-
ganization. Although useful, these metrics only
provide superficial measures of the children?s lan-
guage skills that fail to capture detailed lexico-
syntactic information. For example, in addition to
knowing that a child is able to use specific verb
forms in the right context, such as, third person
singular present tense or regular past tense, knowl-
edge about what are the most common patterns
used by a child, or how many different lexical
forms for noun + verb are present in the child?s
speech is needed because answering these ques-
tions provides more detailed information about the
status of grammatical development. To fill in this
need, we propose a set of measures that aim to cap-
ture language proficiency as a function of lexical
variability in syntactic patterns. We analyze the
information provided by our proposed metrics on
a set of spontaneous story retells and evaluate em-
pirically their potential use in language status pre-
diction.
3 Proposed measures
To present the different metrics we propose in this
study we begin with the definition of the following
concepts:
A syntactic pattern p is an n-gram of part-of-
speech tags denoted as p = ?t1 t2 ... tn?, where
ti indicates the part-of-speech tag corresponding
to the word at position i. For simplicity we use
tpi to indicate the tag at position i from pattern p.
Two examples of syntactic patterns of length two
are ?DT NN? and ?DT JJ? 1.
A lexical form f is an n-gram of words. It is de-
fined as f = ?w1 w2 ... wn?, where wi is the word
at position i. Similarly to the previous definition,
we use wfi to indicate the word at position i in a
lexical form f .
A lexical form f corresponds to a syntactic
pattern p if and only if |f | is equal to |p| and
?ktag(w
f
k ) = t
p
k, where tag() is a function that re-
turns the part-of-speech of its argument. The set of
lexical forms in a given transcript corresponding to
a syntactic pattern p is denoted by LF p. Two ex-
amples of lexical forms from the syntactic pattern
?DT NN? are ?the cat? and ?the frog?.

Table 1: Example of 5 syntactic patterns with their lists of lexical forms and the number of repetitions
of each of them. This information corresponds to an excerpt of an example transcript. DT is the part-of-
speech tag for determiner, NN for noun, and VBD for verb in past tense.
The bag-of-words associated to a syntactic pat-
tern p is denoted as W p. This set is composed
of all the words from the lexical forms that corre-
spond to the syntactic pattern p. It is formally de-
fined as follows: W p = {w|w ? f, f ? LF p}.
For example, the bag-of-words of the syntactic
pattern ?DT NN? with lexical forms ?the cat? and
?the frog? is {the, cat, frog}.
Table 1 shows five syntactic patterns of a tran-
script?s fragment. For each syntactic pattern in the
transcript we show the list of its lexical forms and
their frequency. We will use this example in the
description of the measures in the following sub-
sections.
3.1 Number of different lexical forms
(NDLF)
Analogous to the number of different words
(NDW), where words in the transcript are consid-
ered atomic units, we propose a metric where the
atomic units are lexical forms. Then, we measure
the number of different lexical forms used for each
syntactic pattern in the transcript. Formally, given
a syntactic pattern p and its set of lexical forms
LF p, the number of different lexical forms is com-
puted as follows:
NDLF(p) = |LF p| (1)
This measure gives information about the num-
ber of different ways the child can combine words
in order to construct a fragment of a speech that
corresponds to a specific grammatical pattern. Re-
search in language assessment has shown that
when children are in the early acquisition stages
of certain grammatical constructions they will use
the patterns as ?fixed expressions?. As children
master these constructions they are able to use
these grammatical devices in different contexts,
but also with different surface forms. Thereby, we
could use this measure to discriminate the syntac-
tic patterns the child has better command of from
those that might still be problematic and used in-
frequently or with a limited combination of sur-
face forms. For example, from the information
on Table 1 we see that NDLF(DT NN) = 17, and
NDLF(DT VBD) = 2. This seems to indicate that
the child has a better command of the grammatical
construction determiner + noun (DT NN) and can
thus produce more different lexical forms of this
pattern than determiner + verb (DT + VBD). But
also, we may use this measure to identify rare pat-
terns, that are unlikely to be found in a typically
developing population.
3.2 Lexical forms distribution (LFdist)
Following the idea of lexical forms as atomic
units, NDLF allows to know the different lexical
forms present in the transcripts. But we do not
know the distribution of use of each lexical form
for a specific syntactic pattern. In other words,
NDLF tells us the different surface forms observed
for each syntactic pattern, but it does not measure
the frequency of use of each of these lexical forms,
nor whether each of these forms are used at similar
rates. We propose to use LFdist to provide infor-
mation about the distribution of use for LF p, the
set of lexical forms observed for the syntactic pat-
tern p. We believe that uniform distributions can
be indicative of syntactic structures that the child
has mastered, while uneven distributions can re-
veal structures that the child has only memorized
(i.e. the child uses a fixed and small set of lex-
ical forms). To measure this distribution we use
the entropy of each syntactic pattern. In particu-
lar, given a syntactic pattern p and its set of lexical
forms LF p, the lexical form distribution is com-
puted as follows:
91
LFdist(p) = ?
?
fi?LF p
prob(fi) log prob(fi)
(2)
where
prob(fi) =
count(fi)
?
fk?LF p count(fk)
(3)
and count() is a function that returns the fre-
quency of its argument. Larger values of LFdist
indicate a greater difficulty in the prediction of
the lexical form that is being used under a spe-
cific grammatical pattern. For instance, in the ex-
ample of Table 1, LFdist(DT VBD) = 0.91 and
LFdist(DT NN) = 3.97. This indicates that the
distribution in the use of lexical forms for deter-
miner + noun is more uniform than the use of
lexical forms for determiner + verb, which im-
plies that for determiner + verb there are some
lexical forms that are more frequently used than
others2. Syntactic patterns with small values of
LFdist could flag grammatical constructions the
child does not feel comfortable manipulating and
thus might still be in the acquisition stage of lan-
guage learning.
3.3 Lexical variation (LEX)
Until now we are considering lexical forms as
atomic units. This could lead to overestimating
the real lexical richness in the sample, in particu-
lar for syntactic patterns of length greater than 1.
To illustrate this consider the syntactic pattern p =
?DT NN? and suppose we have the following set
of lexical forms for p = {?the frog?, ?a frog?, ?a
dog?, ?the dog?}. The value for NDLF (p) = 4.
But how many of these eight words are in fact dif-
ferent? That is the type of distinction we want to
make with the next proposed measure: LEX, that
is also an adaptation of type-token ratio (Lu, 2012)
used in the area of communication disorders but
computed over each grammatical pattern. For this
example, we want to be able to find that the lex-
ical variation of ?DT NN? is 0.5 (because there
are only four different words out of eight). For-
mally, given a syntactic pattern p, its set of lexical
forms LF p, and the bag-of-words W p, the lexical
variation is defined as shown in Equation 4.
2We recognize that this is an oversimplification of the en-
tropy measure since the number of outcomes will most likely
be different for each syntactic pattern.
LEX(p) =
|W p|
|LF p| ? n
(4)
Note that |LF p| = NDLF(p), and n is the
length of the syntactic pattern p. In Table 1 the lex-
ical variation of the pattern ?determiner + noun?
(DT+NN) is equal to 0.58 ( 2017?2 ), and for deter-
miner + verb (DT+VBD) is equal to 0.75 ( 32?2 ).
That means 58% of total words used under the pat-
tern ?DT+NN? are different, in comparison with
the 75% for ?DT+VBD?. In general, the closer the
value of LEX is to 1, there is less overlap between
the words in the lexical forms for that pattern.
Our hypothesis behind this measure is that for the
same syntactic pattern TD children may have less
overlap of words than children with LI, e.g. less
overlap indicates the use of a more diverse set of
words.
3.4 Lexical use of syntactic knowledge
(LexSyn)
With LEX we hope to accomplish the character-
ization of lexical richness of syntactic patterns
assuming that each part-of-speech has a similar
number of possible lexical forms. We assume as
well that less overlap in the words used for the
same grammatical pattern represents a more devel-
oped language than that with more overlap. How-
ever the definition of LEX overlooks a well known
fact about language: different word classes have
a different range of possibilities as their lexical
forms. Consider open class items, such as nouns
and verbs, where the lexicon is large and keeps
growing. In contrast, closed class items, such as
prepositions and determiners are fixed and have a
very small number of lexical forms. Therefore it
seems unfair to assign equal weight to the overlap
of words for these different classes. To account
for this phenomenon, we propose a new measure
that includes the information about the syntactic
knowledge that the child shows for each part of
speech. That is, we weigh the level of overlap
for specific grammatical constructions according
to the lexicon for the specific word classes in-
volved. Since we limit our analysis to the language
sample at hand, we define the ceiling of the lexi-
cal richness of a specific word class to be the to-
tal number of different surface forms found in the
transcript. In particular, given a syntactic pattern
p = ?t1 t2 ... tn?, with its set of lexical forms
LF p, the lexical use of syntactic knowledge is de-
fined as:
92
LexSyn(p) =
1
n
n?
i=1
|wfi |f ? LF
p|
NDLF(tpi )
(5)
where the numerator is the size of the set of
words in the i-th position in all the lexical forms.
Note that this measure does not make sense for
syntactic patterns of length < 2. Instead, syn-
tactic patterns of length 1 were used to identify
the syntactic knowledge of the child by using the
NDLF of each POS in p. In the example of Ta-
ble 1, LexSyn(DT NN) = 0.59. This value corre-
sponds to the sum of the number of different de-
terminers used in position 1 for LF p divided by
the total number of different determiners that this
child produced in the sample (for this case, the
number of determiners that this child produced is
given by NDLF(DT), that is 5), plus the number
of different nouns used under this syntactic pat-
tern over the total number of nouns produced by
the child (NDLF(NN)=29). The complete calcula-
tion of LexSyn(DT NN) = 12 ?(
3
5+
17
29) = 0.59.
This contrasts with the value of LexSyn for the pat-
tern ?determiner + verb?, LexSyn(DT VBD) =
1
2 ? (
1
5 +
2
25) = 0.14 that seems to indicate that the
child has more experience combining determiners
and nouns than determiners and verbs. Perhaps
this child has had limited exposure to other pat-
terns combining determiner and verb, or this pat-
tern is at a less mature stage in the linguistic reper-
toire of the child.
Children with LI tend to exhibit a less devel-
oped command of syntax than their TD cohorts.
Syntactic patterns with large values of LexSyn
show a high versatility in the use of those syntactic
patterns. However, since the syntactic reference is
taken from the same child, this versatility is rela-
tive only to what is observed in that single tran-
script. For instance, suppose that the total num-
ber of different determiners observed in the child?s
transcript is 1. Then any time the child uses that
determiner in a syntactic pattern, the knowledge of
this class, according to our metric, will be 100%,
which is correct, but this might not be enough to
determine if the syntactic knowledge of the child
for this grammatical class corresponds to age ex-
pectations for a typically developing child. In or-
der to improve the measurement of the lexical use
of syntactic knowledge we propose the measure
LexSynEx, that instead of using the information
of the same child to define the coverage of use for
a specific word class, it uses the information ob-
served for a held out set of transcripts from TD
children. This variation allows the option of mov-
ing the point of reference to a specific cohort, ac-
cording to what is needed.
4 Data set
The data used in this research is part of an ongoing
study of language impairment in Spanish-English
speaking children (Pen?a et al, 2003). From this
study we used a set of 175 children with a mean
age of about 70 months. Language status of these
children was determined via expert judgment by
three bilingual certified speech-language pathol-
ogists. At the end of the data collection period,
the experts reviewed child records in both lan-
guages including language samples, tests proto-
cols, and parent and teacher questionnaire data.
They made independent judgments about chil-
dren?s lexical, morphosyntactic, and narrative per-
formance in each language. Finally, they made an
overall judgment about children?s language abil-
ity using a 6 point scale (severely language im-
paired to above normal impairment). If at least two
examiners rated children?s language ability with
mild, moderate or severe impairment they were as-
signed to the LI group. Percent agreement among
the three examiners was 90%. As a result of this
process, 20 children were identified by the clinical
researchers as having LI, while the remaining 155
were identified as typically developing (TD).
The transcripts were gathered following stan-
dard procedures for collection of spontaneous lan-
guage samples in the field of communication dis-
orders. Using a wordless picture book, the chil-
dren were asked to narrate the story. The two
books used were ?A boy, a dog, and a frog? (Mayer,
1967) and ?Frog, where are you?? (Mayer, 1969).
For each child in the sample, 4 transcripts of story
narratives were collected, 2 in each language. In
this study we use only the transcripts where En-
glish was the target language.
5 Procedure
The purpose of the following analysis is to inves-
tigate the different aspects in the child?s language
that can be revealed by the proposed metrics. All
our measures are based on POS tags. We used the
Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) to generate the
POS tags of the transcripts. For all the results re-
ported here we removed the utterances from the
interrogators and use all utterances by the chil-
93
dren. From the 155 TD instances, we randomly se-
lected 20, that together with the 20 instances with
LI form the test set. The remaining 135 TD in-
stances were used as the normative population, our
training set.
After the POS tagging process, we extracted the
set of syntactic patterns with length equal to 1, 2, 3
and 4 that appear in at least 80% of the transcripts
in the training set. The 80% threshold was chosen
with the goal of preserving the content that is most
likely to represent the TD population.
6 Analysis of the proposed measures and
implications
Figure 1 shows 5 plots corresponding to each of
our proposed measures. Each graph shows a com-
parison between the average values of the TD and
the LI populations. The x-axis in the graphs rep-
resents all the syntactic patterns gathered from the
training set that appeared on the test data, and the
y-axis represents the difference in the z-score val-
ues of each measure from the test set. The x-axis
is sorted in descending order according to the z-
score differences between values of TD and LI.
The most relevant discovery is that NDFL,
LFdist, LexSyn and LexSynEx show a wider gap
in the z-scores between the TD and LI popula-
tions for most of the syntactic patterns analyzed.
This difference is easy to note visually as most of
the TD patterns tend to have larger values, while
the ones for children with LI have lower scores.
Therefore, it seems our measures are indeed cap-
turing relevant information that characterizes the
language of the TD population.
Analyzing LEX from Figure 1, we see that most
of the LEX values are positive, for both TD and
LI instances, and we cannot observe marked dif-
ferences between them. That might be a con-
sequence of assuming all word classes can have
an equivalent number of different lexical forms.
Once we weigh each POS tag in the pattern by the
word forms the child has used (as in LexSyn and
LexSynEx), noticeable differences across the two
groups emerge. When we include syntactic knowl-
edge of a group of children (as in LexSynEx), those
similarities disappear. This behavior highlights the
need for a combined lexico-syntactic measure that
can describe latent information about language us-
age in children.
For building an intervention plan that helps to
improve child language skills, practitioners could

use the knowledge of specific grammatical con-
structions that need to be emphasized ?those that
seem to be problematic for the LI group. These
structures can be identified by pulling the syntac-
tic patterns with the largest difference in z-scores
from the TD population. Table 2 shows a list of
syntactic patterns with small values for LI and the
largest differences between LI and TD instances
in the test set. As the table indicates, most of the
syntactic patterns have length greater than 1. This
is not surprising since we aimed for developing
measures of higher-order analysis that can com-
plement the level of information provided by com-
monly used metrics in language assessment (as in
the case of MLU, NDW or F/C). The table also
shows that while each measure identifies a differ-
ent subset of syntactic patterns as relevant, some
syntactic patterns emerge in all the metrics. For
instance, personal pronoun + auxiliary verb + ad-
verb and there + auxiliary verb. This repetition
highlights the importance of those grammatical
constructions. But the differences also show that
the metrics complement each other. In general,
the syntactic patterns in the list represent complex
grammatical constructions where children with LI
are showing a less advanced command of language
use.

forms present under pronoun + verb (3rd person
singular present) + verb (gerund or present par-
ticiple) (PP VBZ VBG) in all our data set. The last

row in that table presents an example of the lexi-
cal forms used by two children. Note that for the
child with LI, there is only one lexical form: he is
touching. On the other hand, the TD child is using
the grammatical pattern with six different surface
forms. Clinical practitioners can take this infor-
mation and design language tasks that emphasize
the use of ?PP VBZ VBG? constructions.
6.1 Analysis of correlations among measures
To analyze the level of overlap between our mea-
sures we computed correlation coefficients among
them. The results are shown in Table 4.
The results from the correlation analysis are not
that surprising. They show that closely related
measures are highly to moderately correlated. For
instance, LEX and eLEX have a correlation of
TD LI
number of PP 6 5
number of VBZ 3 2
number of VBG 7 4
Example (instances: she is putting he is touching
td-0156 and li-3022) she is going
he is pushing
she is looking
she is carrying
she is playing

0.69, and LexSynEx and LexSyn have a correla-
tion of 0.61. NDLF and LFdist showed a posi-
tive correlation score of 0.81. This high correla-

quency of use. While this may be a common phe-
nomenon of language use, it does not have a neg-
ative effect since the same effect will be observed
in both groups of children and we care to see the
differences in performance between a TD and an
LI population.
For all other pairs of measures, the correlation
scores were in the range of [?0.5, 0.1]. It was in-
teresting to note that LexSyn showed the lowest
correlation with the rest of the measures (between
[?0.11, 0.01]).
Correlation coefficients between our metrics
and MLU, NDW, and F/C were computed sepa-
rately for syntactic patterns of different lengths.
However all the different matrices showed the
same correlation patterns. We found a high cor-
relation between MLU and NDW, but low cor-
relation with all our proposed measures, except
for one case: NDW and LexSyn seemed to be
highly correlated (?-0.7). Interestingly, we noted
that despite the high correlation between MLU and
NDW, MLU and LexSyn showed weak correlation
(?-0.4). Overall, the findings from this analysis
support the use of our metrics as complimentary
measures for child language assessment.
7 Conclusions and future work
We proposed a set of new measures that were de-
veloped to characterize the lexico-syntactic vari-
ability of child language. Each measure aims to
find information that is not captured by traditional
measures used in communication disorders.
Our study is still preliminary in nature and re-
quires an in depth evaluation and analysis with a
larger pool of subjects. However the results pre-
sented are encouraging. The set of experiments
we discussed showed that TD and LI children have
significant differences in performance according
to our metrics and thus these metrics can be used to
enrich models of language trajectories in child lan-
guage acquisition. Another potential use of met-
rics similar to those proposed here is the design of
targeted intervention practices.
The scripts to compute the metrics as described
in this paper are available to the research commu-
nity by contacting the authors. However, the sim-
plicity of the metrics makes it easy for anyone to
implement, and it certainly makes it easy for clin-
ical researchers to interpret.
Our proposed metrics are a contribution to the
set of already known metrics for language assess-
ment. The goal of these new metrics is not to
replace existing ones, but to complement what is
already available with concise information about
higher-order syntactic constructions in the reper-
toire of TD children.
We are interested in evaluating the use of our
metrics in a longitudinal study. We believe they
are a promising framework to represent language
acquisition trajectories.
