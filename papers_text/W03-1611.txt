Abstract
This paper proposes a novel method to extract
paraphrases of Japanese noun phrases from a
set of documents. The proposed method con-
sists of three steps: (1) retrieving passages us-
ing character-based index terms given a noun
phrase as an input query, (2) filtering the re-
trieved passages with syntactic and seman-
tic constraints, and (3) ranking the passages
and reformatting them into grammatical forms.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate the
method by using 53 noun phrases and three
years worth of newspaper articles. The ac-
curacy of the method needs to be further im-
proved for fully automatic paraphrasing but the
proposed method can extract novel paraphrases
which past approaches could not.
1 Introduction
We can use various linguistic expressions to denote a con-
cept by virtue of richness of natural language. However
this richness becomes a crucial obstacle when processing
natural language by computer. For example, mismatches
of index terms cause failure of retrieving relevant docu-
ments in information retrieval systems, in which docu-
ments are retrieved on the basis of surface string match-
ing. To remedy this problem, the current information re-
trieval system adopts query expansion techniques which
replace a query term with a set of its synonyms (Baeza-
Yates and Riberto-Neto, 1999). The query expansion
works well for single-word index terms, but more sophis-
ticated techniques are necessary for larger index units,
such as phrases. The effectiveness of phrasal indexing
has recently drawn researchers? attention (Lewis, 1992;
Mitra et al, 1997; Tokunaga et al, 2002). However,
query expansion of phrasal index terms has not been fully
investigated yet (Jacquemin et al, 1997).
To deal with variations of linguistic expressions, para-
phrasing has recently been studied for various applica-
tions of natural language processing, such as machine
translation (Mitamura, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita,
2002), dialog systems (Ebert et al, 2001), QA sys-
tems (Katz, 1997) and information extraction (Shinyama
et al, 2002). Paraphrasing is defined as a process of
transforming an expression into another while keeping its
meaning intact. However, it is difficult to define what
?keeping its meaning intact? means, although it is the
core of the definition. On what basis could we consider
different linguistic expressions denoting the same mean-
ing? This becomes a crucial question when finding para-
phrases automatically.
In past research, various types of clues have been used
to find paraphrases. For example, Shinyama et al tried
to find paraphrases assuming that two sentences sharing
many Named Entities and a similar structure are likely
to be paraphrases of each other (Shinyama et al, 2002).
Barzilay and McKeown assume that two translations
from the same original text contain paraphrases (Barzi-
lay and McKeown, 2001). Torisawa used subcategoriza-
tion information of verbs to paraphrase Japanese noun
phrase construction ?NP1 no NP2? into a noun phrase
with a relative clause (Torisawa, 2001). Most of previ-
ous work on paraphrasing took corpus-based approach
with notable exceptions of Jacquemin (Jacquemin et al,
1997; Jacquemin, 1999) and Katz (Katz, 1997). In par-
ticular, text alignment technique is generally used to find
sentence level paraphrases (Shimohata and Sumita, 2002;
Barzilay and Lee, 2002).
In this paper, we follow the corpus-based approach
and propose a method to find paraphrases of a Japanese
noun phrase in a large corpus using information retrieval
techniques. The significant feature of our method is
use of character-based indexing. Japanese uses four
types of writing; Kanzi (Chinese characters), Hiragana,
Katakana, and Roman alphabet. Among these, Hiragana
and Katakana are phonographic, and Kanzi is an ideo-
graphic writing. Each Kanzi character itself has a certain
meaning and provides a basis for rich word formation
ability for Japanese. We use Kanzi characters as index
terms to retrieve paraphrase candidates, assuming that
noun phrases sharing the same Kanzi characters could be
paraphrases of each other. For example, character-based
indexing enables us to retrieve a paraphrase ??????
? (a commuting child)? for ???????? (a child
going to school)?. Note that their head is the same, ??
? (child)?, and their modifiers are different but sharing
common characters ?? (commute)? and ?? (study)?. As
shown in this example, the paraphrases generated based
on Japanese word formation rule cannot be classified in
terms of the past paraphrase classification (Jacquemin et
al., 1997).
The proposed method is summarized as follows. Given
a Japanese noun phrase as input, the method finds its
paraphrases in a set of documents. In this paper, we used
a collection of newspaper articles as a set of documents,
from which paraphrases are retrieved. The process is de-
composed into following three steps:
1. retrieving paraphrase candidates,
2. filtering the retrieved candidates based on syntactic
and semantic constraints, and
3. ranking the resulting candidates.
Newspaper articles are segmented into passages at punc-
tuation symbols, then the passages are indexed based on
Kanzi characters and stored in a database. The database
is searched with a query, an input noun phrase, to obtain a
set of passages, which are paraphrase candidates. In gen-
eral, using smaller index units, such as characters, results
in gains in recall at the cost of precision. To remedy this,
we introduce a filtering step after retrieving paraphrase
candidates. Filtering is performed based on syntactic and
semantic constraints. The resulting candidates are ranked
and provided as paraphrases.
The following three sections 2, 3 and 4 describe each
of three steps in detail. Section 5 describes experiments
to evaluate the proposed method. Finally, section 6 con-
cludes the paper and looks at the future work.
2 Retrieving paraphrase candidates
2.1 Indexing and term expansion
In conventional information retrieval, a query is given to
the system to retrieve a list of documents which are ar-
ranged in descending order of relevance. Our aim is to
obtain paraphrases given a noun phrase as a query, where
retrieved objects should be smaller than documents. We
divide a document into a set of passages at punctuation
symbols. These passages are retrieved by a given query,
a noun phrase.
The input noun phrase and the passages are segmented
into words and they are assigned part of speech tags by
a morphological analyzer. Among these tagged words,
content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and un-
known words are selected. Kanzi characters contained
in these words are extracted as index terms. In addi-
tion to Kanzi characters, words written in Katakana (most
of them are imported words) and numbers are also used
as index terms. Precisely speaking, different numbers
should be considered to denote different meaning, but to
avoid data sparseness problem, we abstract numbers into
a special symbol ?num?.
As mentioned in section 1, the query expansion tech-
nique is often used in information retrieval to solve the
surface notational difference between queries and docu-
ments. We also introduce query expansion for retrieving
passage. Since we use Kanzi characters as index terms,
we need linguistic knowledge defining groups of simi-
lar characters for query expansion. However this kind of
knowledge is not available at hand. We obtain similar-
ity of Kanzi characters from an ordinary thesaurus which
defines similarity of words.
If a word t is not a Katakana word, we expand it to
a set of Kanzi characters E(t) which is defined by (1),
where Ct is a semantic class including the word t, KC is
a set of Kanzi characters used in words of semantic class
C, fr(k,C) is a frequency of a Kanzi character k used
in words of semantic class C, and Kt is a set of Kanzi
characters in word t.
E(t) = {k|k ? KCt , k? = argmaxl?Kt fr(l, Ct),
fr(k,Ct) > fr(k?, Ct)} ?Kt?
{s|s ? Ct, s is a Katakana word}
(1)
E(t) consists of Kanzi characters which is used in words
of semantic class Ct more frequently, than the most fre-
quent Kanzi character in the word t. If the word t is a
Katakana word, it is not expanded.
Let us see an expansion example of word ??? (hot
spring)?. Here we have t = ???? to expand, and we
have two characters that make the word, i.e. Kt = {
?, ? }. Suppose ???? belongs to a semantic class
Ct in which we find a set of words {??? (hot sprint
place), ???? (lukewarm water), ?? (warm water),
?? (spa), ???? (oasis), . . . }. From this word set,
we extract characters and count their occurence to obtain
KCt = { ? (35), ? (22), ? (20), ? (8),. . . }, where
a number in parentheses denotes the frequency of char-
acters in the semantic class Ct. Since the most frequent
character of Kt in KCt is ??? in this case, more fre-
quently used character ??? is added to E(t). In addi-
tion, Katakana words ???? and ?????? are added
to E(t) as well.
2.2 Term weighting
An index term is usually assigned a certain weight ac-
cording to its importance in user?s query and documents.
There are many proposals of term weighting most of
which are based on term frequency (Baeza-Yates and
Riberto-Neto, 1999) in a query and documents. Term
frequency-based weighting resides on Luhn?s assump-
tion (Luhn, 1957) that a repeatedly mentioned expression
denotes an important concepts. However it is obvious that
this assumption does not hold when retrieving paraphrase
candidates from a set of documents. For term weighting,
we use character frequency in a semantic class rather than
that in a query and documents, assuming that a character
frequently used in words of a semantic class represents
the concept of that semantic class very well.
A weight of a term k in a word t is calculated by (2).
w(k) =
?
???????
???????
100
if k is Katakana word or ?num?
100? log fr(k,Ct)?
k?inE(t)
log fr(k?, Ct)
if k is a Kanzi
(2)
Katakana words and numbers are assigned a constant
value, 100, and a Kanzi character is assigned a weight ac-
cording to its frequency in the semantic class Ct, where
k is used in the word t.
In the previous example of ????, we have obtained
an expanded term set { ?, ?, ?, ??, ???? }.
Among this set, ???? and ?????? are assigned
weight 100 because these are Katakana words, and the
rest three characters are assigned weight according to its
frequency in the class. For example, ??? is assigned
weight 100? log 35log 35+log 22+log 8 = 40.7.
2.3 Similarity
Similarity between an input noun phrase (I) and a pas-
sage (D) is calculated by summing up the weights of
terms which are shared by I and D, as defined in (3). In
the equation, k takes values over the index terms shared
by I and D, w(k) is its weight calculated as described in
the previous section.
sim(I,D) =
?
k?I?k?D
w(k) (3)
Note that since we do not use term frequency in passages,
we do not introduce normalization of passage length.
3 Syntactic and semantic filtering
The proposed method utilizes Kanzi characters as index
terms. In general, making index terms smaller units in-
creases exhaustivity to gain recall, but, at the same time, it
decreases specificity to degrade precision (Sparck Jones,
1972). We aim to gain recall by using smaller units as in-
dex terms at the cost of precision. Even though Kanzi are
ideograms and have more specificity than phonograms,
they are still less specific than words. Therefore there
would be many irrelevant passages retrieved due to coin-
cidentally shared characters. In this section, we describe
a process to filter out irrelevant passages based on the fol-
lowing two viewpoints.
Semantic constraints : Retrieved passages should con-
tain all concepts mentioned in the input noun phrase.
Syntactic constraints : Retrieved passages should have
a syntactically proper structure corresponding to the
input noun phrase.
3.1 Semantic constraints
In the indexing phase, we have decomposed an input
noun phrase and passages into a set of Kanzi characters
for retrieval. In the filtering phase, from these charac-
ters, we reconstruct words denoting a concept and verify
if concepts mentioned in the input noun phrase are also
included in the retrieved passages.
To achieve this, a retrieved passage is syntactically an-
alyzed and dependencies between bunsetu (word phrase)
are identified. Then, the correspondence between words
of the input noun phrase and bunsetu of the passage is
verified. This matching is done on the basis of sharing
the same Kanzi characters or the same Katakana words.
Passages missing any of the concepts mentioned in the
input noun phrase are discarded in this phase.
3.2 Syntactic constraints
Since passages are generated on the basis of punctuation
symbols, each passage is not guaranteed to have a syntac-
tically proper structure. In addition, a part of the passage
tends to be a paraphrase of the input noun phrase rather
than the whole passage. In such cases, it is necessary to
extract a corresponding part from the retrieved passage
and transform it into a proper syntactic structure.
By applying semantic constraints above, we have iden-
tified a set of bunsetu covering the concepts mentioned
in the input noun phrase. We extract a minimum depen-
dency structure which covers all the identified bunsetu.
Finally the extracted structure is transformed into a
proper phrase or clause by changing the ending of the
head (the right most element) and deleting unnecessary
elements such as punctuation symbols, particles and so
on.
Figure 1 illustrates the matching and transforming pro-
cess described in this section. The input noun phrase
is ??? w1 ?? w2 ? w3 ???? w4 (reduction of
telephone rate)? which consists of four words w1 . . . w4.
Suppose a passage ?????????????????
(the company?s telephone rate reduction caused. . . ? is re-
trieved. This passage is syntactically analyzed to give the
dependency structure of four bunsetu b1 . . . b4 as shown
in Figure 1.
Input NP ?? ?? ? ????
 (telephone) (charge) (of) (reduction)w1 w2 w3 w4
Retrieved ??? ????? ????? ???
passage (the company's) (telephone charge) (reduction) (caused)b1 b2 b3 b4
??????????

Extract proper structure
Transform ending
Figure 1: An example of matching and transformation
Correspondence between word w1 and bunsetu b2 is
made bacause they share a common character ???. Word
w2 corresponds to bunsetu b2 as well due to characters ?
?? and ???. And word w4 corresponds to bunsetu b3.
Although there is no counterpart of word w3, this pas-
sage is not discarded because word w3 is a function word
(postposition). After making correspondences, a mini-
mum dependency structure, the shaded part in Figure 1,
is extracted. Then the ending auxiliary verb is deleted
and the verb is restored to the base form.
4 Ranking
Retrieved passages are ranked according to the similarity
with an input noun phrase as described in section 2. How-
ever this ranking is not always suitable from the view-
point of paraphrasing. Some of the retrieved passages are
discarded and others are transformed through processes
described in the previous section. In this section, we de-
scribe a process to rerank remaining passages according
to their appropriateness as paraphrases of the input noun
phrase. We take into account the following three factors
for reranking.
? Similarity score of passage retrieval
? Distance between words
? Contextual information
The following subsections describe each of these factors.
4.1 Similarity score of retrieval
The similarity score used in passage retrieval is not suffi-
cient for evaluating the quality of the paraphrases. How-
ever, it reflects relatedness between the input noun phrase
and retrieved passages. Therefore, the similarity score
calculated by (3) is taken into account when ranking para-
phrase candidates.
4.2 Distance between words
In general, distance between words which have a de-
pendency relation reflects the strength of their semantic
closeness. We take into account the distance between two
bunsetu which have a dependency relation and contain
adjacent two words in the input noun phrase respectively.
This factor is formalized as in (4), where ti is the ith word
in the input noun phrase, and dist(s, t) is the distance be-
tween two bunsetu each of which contains s and t. A
distance between two bunsetu is defined as the number of
bunsetu between them. When two words are contained in
the same bunsetu, the distance between them is defined
as 0.
Mdistance = 11 +
?
i
dist(ti, ti+1)
(4)
4.3 Contextual information
We assume that phrases sharing the same Kanzi char-
acters likely represent the same meaning. Therefore
they could be paraphrases of each other. However, even
though a Kanzi denotes a certain meaning, its meaning is
often ambiguous. This problem is similar to word sense
ambiguities, which have been studied for many years. To
solve this problem, we adopt an idea one sense per collo-
cation which was introduced in word sense disambigua-
tion research (Yarowsky, 1995). Considering a newspa-
per article in which the retrieved passage and the input
noun phrase is included as the context, the context sim-
ilarity is taken into account for ranking paraphrase can-
didates. More concretely, context similarity is calculated
by following procedure.
1. For each paraphrase candidate, a context vector is
constructed from the newspaper article containing
the passage from which the candidate is derived.
The article is morphologically analyzed and content
words are extracted to make the context vector. The
tf ? idf metric is used for term weighting.
2. Since the input is given in terms of a noun phrase,
there is no corresponding newspaper article for the
input. However there is a case where the retrieved
passages include the input noun phrase. Such pas-
sages are not useful for finding paraphrases, but use-
ful for constructing a context vector of the input
noun phrase. The context vector of the input noun
phrase is constructed in the same manner as that of
paraphrase candidates, except that all newspaper ar-
ticles including the noun phrase are used.
3. Context similarity Mcontext is calculated by cosine
measure of two context vectors as in (5), where
wi(k) and wd(k) are the weight of the k-th term of
the input context vector and the candidate context
vector, respectively.
Mcontext =
?
k wi(k)wd(k)??
k w2i (k)
??
k w2d(k)
(5)
4.4 Ranking paraphrase candidates
Paraphrase candidates are ranked in descending order of
the product of three measures, sim(I,D) (equation (3)),
Mdistance (equation (4)) and Mcontext (equation (5)).
5 Experiments
5.1 Data and preprocessing
As input noun phrases, we used 53 queries excerpted
from Japanese IR test collection BMIR-J21 (Kitani et al,
1998) based on the following criteria.
? A query has two or more index terms.
It is less likely to retrieve proper paraphrases with
only one index term, since we adopt character-based
indexing.
? A query does not contain proper names.
It is generally difficult to paraphrase proper names.
We do not deal with proper name paraphrasing.
? A query contains at most one Katakana word or
number.
The proposed method utilize characteristics of Kanzi
characters, ideograms. It is obvious that the method
does not work well for Kanzi -poor expressions.
We searched paraphrases in three years worth of news-
paper articles (Mainichi Shimbun) from 1991 to 1993. As
described in section 2, each article is segmented into pas-
sages at punctuation marks and symbols. These passages
are assigned a unique identifier and indexed, then stored
in the GETA retrieval engine (IPA, 2003). We used the
JUMAN morphological analyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao,
1998) for indexing the passages. As a result of prepro-
cessing described above, we obtained 6,589,537 passages
to retrieve. The average number of indexes of a passage
was 12.
5.2 Qualitative evaluation
Out of 53 input noun phrases, no paraphrase was obtained
for 7 cases. Output paraphrases could be classified into
the following categories.
1BMIR-2 contains 60 queries.
(1) The paraphrase has the same meaning as that of the
input noun phrase.
e.g. ????? (damage by cool summer) ???
(cool summer damage)2
Note that this example is hardly obtained by the ex-
isting approaches such as syntactic transformation
and word substitution with thesaurus.
(2) The paraphrase does not have exactly the same
meaning but has related meaning. This category is
further divided into three subcategories.
(2-a) The meaning of the paraphrase is more specific
than that of the input noun phrase.
e.g. ?? (agricultural chemicals)?????
?? (insecticide and herbicide)
(2-b) The meaning of the paraphrase is more general
than that of the input noun phrase.
e.g. ???? (stock movement)??????
????? (movement of stock and exchange
rate)
(2-c) The paraphrase has related meaning to the in-
put but is not categorized into above two.
e.g. ??? (drinks) ???????? (inter-
national drink exhibition)
(3) There is no relation between the paraphrase and the
input noun phrase.
Among these categories, (1) and (2-a) are useful from
a viewpoint of information retrieval. By adding the para-
phrase of these classes to a query, we can expect the ef-
fective phrase expansion in queries.
Since the paraphrase of (2-b) generalizes the concept
denoted by the input, using these paraphrases for query
expansion might degrade precision of the retrieval. How-
ever, they might be useful for the recall-oriented retrieval.
The paraphrases of (2-c) have the similar property, since
relatedness includes various viewpoints.
The main reason of retrieval failure and irrelevant re-
trieval (3) are summarized as follows:
? The system cannot generate a paraphrase, when
there is no proper paraphrase for the input. In partic-
ular, this tends to be the case for single-word inputs,
such as ??? (liquid crystal)? and ??? (movie)?.
But this does not imply the proposed method does
not work well for single-words inputs. We had sev-
eral interesting paraphrases for single-word inputs,
such as ??????? (chemicals for agriculture
and gardening)? for ??? (agricultural chemicals)?.
? We used only three years worth of newspaper ar-
ticles due to the limitation of computational re-
soruces. Sometimes, the system could not generate
2The left-hand side of the arrow is the input and the right-
hand side is its paraphrase.
the paraphrase of the input because of the limited
size of the corpus.
5.3 Quantitative evaluation
Since there is no test collection available to evaluate para-
phrasing, we asked three judges to evaluate the output of
the system subjectively. The judges classified the outputs
into the categories introduced in 5.2. The evaluation was
done on the 46 inputs which gave at least one output.
Table 1 shows the results of judgments. Column ?Q?
denotes the query identifier, ?Len.? denotes its length in
morphemes, ?#Para.? denotes the number of outputs and
the columns (1) through (3) denote the number of outputs
which are classified into each category by three judges.
Therefore, the sum of these columns makes a triple of the
number of outputs. The decimal numbers in the paren-
theses denote the generalized raw agreement indices of
each category, which are calculated as given in (6) (Ue-
bersax, 2001), where K is the number of judged cases, C
is the number of categories, njk is the number of times
category j is applied to case k, and nk is calculated by
summing up over categories on case k; nk =
?C
j=1 njk.
ps(j) =
?K
k=1 njk(njk ? 1)?K
k=1 nk ? 1
(6)
In our case, K is the number of outputs (column
?#Para.?), nk is the number of judges, 3, and j moves
over (1) through (3).
As discussed in 5.2, from the viewpoint of information
retrieval, paraphrases of category (1) and (2-a) are use-
ful for query expansion of phrasal index terms. Column
?Acc.? denotes the ratio of paraphrases of category (1)
and (2-a) to the total outputs. Column ?Prec.? denotes
non-interpolated average precision. Since the precision
differs depending on the judge, the column is showing
the average of the precisions given by three judges.
We could obtain 45 paraphrases on average for each
input. But the average accuracy is quite low, 10%, which
means only one tenth of output is useful. Even though
considering that all paraphrases not being in category (3)
are useful, the accuracy only doubled. This means filter-
ing conditions should be more rigid. However, looking
at the agreement indices, we see that category (3) ranks
very high. Therefore, we expect finding the paraphrases
in category (3) is easy for a human. From all this, we
conclude that the proposed method need to be improved
in accuracy to be used for automatic query expansion in
information retrieval, but it is usable to help users to mod-
ify their queries by suggesting possible paraphrases.
Seeing the column ?Len.?, we find that the proposed
method does not work for complex noun phrases. The
average length of input noun phrase is 4.5 morphemes.
The longer input often results in less useful paraphrases.
The number of outputs also decreases for longer inputs.
We require all concepts mentioned in the input to have
their counterparts in its paraphrases as described in 3.1.
This condition seems to be strict for longer inputs. In
addition, we need to take into account syntactic variations
of longer inputs. Integrating syntactic transformation into
the proposed method is one of the possible extensions to
explore when dealing with longer inputs (Yoshikane et
al., 2002).
6 Conclusions and future work
This paper proposed a novel approach to extract para-
phrases of a Japanese noun phrase from a corpus. The
proposed method adopts both information retrieval tech-
niques and natural language processing techniques. Un-
like past research, the proposed method uses Kanzi
(ideograms) characters as index terms and retrieves para-
phrase candidates in a set of passages. The retrieved can-
didates are then filtered out based on syntactic and se-
mantic constraints.
The method was evaluated by a test set of 53 noun
phrases, and paraphrases were extracted for 46 cases.
These paraphrases were evaluated subjectively by three
independent judges. The quantitative evaluation suggests
that the performance needs to be further improved for
fully automatic query expansion in information retrieval,
but is usable to help users modify their queries by sug-
gesting possible paraphrases.
From a qualitative point of view, the proposed method
could extract paraphrases which cannot be obtained by
previous approaches such as syntactic transformation
and word substitution. Considering characteristics of
Japanese word formation by using character-based index-
ing enables us to obtain novel paraphrases.
The performance of the current system needs to be im-
proved for fully automatic paraphrasing. One direction
is introducing more precise filtering criteria. The cur-
rent system adopts only dependency analysis of bunsetu.
We need case analysis as well, to capture relations among
the bunsetu. Integrating syntactic transformation into the
proposed method is another research direction to explore.
In this paper, we evaluated output paraphrases subjec-
tively. Task oriented evaluation should be also conducted.
For example, effectiveness of phrase expansion in infor-
mation retrieval systems should be investigated.
