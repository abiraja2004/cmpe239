Abstract 
This paper describes a technique for automati-
cally tagging political blog posts using SVM?s 
and named entity recognition. We compare 
the quality of the tags detected by this ap-
proach to earlier approaches in other domains, 
observing effects from the political domain 
and benefits from NLP techniques comple-
mentary to the core SVM method. 
1 Introduction 
Political blogs are a particular type of communica-
tion platform that combines analyses provided by 
the blog owner or a team of regular contributors 
with shorter, but far more numerous, entries by 
visitors. Given the enthusiasm that activities for or 
against a particular politician or party can generate, 
political blogs are a vibrant part of the blogos-
phere: more than 38,500 blogs specifically dedi-
cated to politics exist in the US alone according to 
Technorati, and some of the more active ones at-
tract more than 30 million unique visitors each 
month (double that number just before major elec-
tions). 
Political blogs provide a wealth of factual in-
formation about political events and activities, but 
also by their nature are colored by strong opinions. 
They are therefore a particularly attractive target 
for semantic analysis methods using natural lan-
guage processing technology. In fact, the past two 
years have brought an increased number of colla-
borations between NLP researchers and political 
scientists using data from political sources, includ-
ing two special issues of leading political science 
journals on such topics (see (Cardie and Wilker-
son, 2008) for an overview). Our motivation for 
working with this kind of data is the construction 
of a system that collates information across blog 
posts, combines evidence to numerically rate atti-
tudes of blogs on different topics, and traces the 
evolution of these attitudes across time and in re-
sponse to events. To enable these tasks, we first 
identify the major topics that each blog post cov-
ers. In the present paper, we describe our recogniz-
er of blog post topics. We show that, perhaps 
because of the richness of political blogs in named 
entities, an SVM-based keyword learning approach 
can be complemented with named entity recogni-
tion and co-reference detection to achieve preci-
sion and recall scores higher than those reported by 
earlier topic recognition systems in other domains. 
2 Related Work  
In our approach, as in earlier published work, we 
take tags assigned by many blogs to individual 
blog posts as a reference list of the topics covered 
by that post. Tags are single words or short phras-
es, most often noun phrases, and are usually cho-
sen by each post?s authors without a controlled 
vocabulary; examples include ?Michigan?, 
?George Bush?, ?democracy?, and ?health care?. 
Earlier work in predicting tags includes (Mishne, 
2006), who adopts a collaborative filtering ap-
proach; in contrast, we rely on training classifiers 
from earlier posts in each blog. Our approach is 
more similar to (Sood et al, 2007) and (Wang and 
Davison, 2008) who use different machine learning 
techniques applied to a training set. We differ from 
the last two approaches in our addition of proper 
noun and named entity recognition methods to our 
core SVM classifiers, in our exploration of specifi-
cally political data, and in our subsequent use of 
21
the predicted tags (for semantic analysis rather 
than tag set compression or query expansion). 
3 Data 
We collected data from two major political blogs, 
Daily Kos (www.dailykos.com) and Red State 
(www.redstate.com). Red State is a conserva-
tive political blog whereas Daily Kos is a liberal 
political blog. Both these blogs are widely read and 
tag each of their blog entries. We collected data 
from both these blogs over a period of two years 
(January 2008 ? February 2010). We collected a 
total of 100,000 blog posts from Daily Kos and 
70,000 blog posts from Red State and a total of 
787,780 tags across both blogs (an average of 4.63 
tags per post). 
4 Methods 
We used SVM Light (Joachims, 2002) to predict 
the tags for a given blog post. We constructed one 
classifier for each of the tags present in the training 
set. The features used were counts of each word 
encountered in the title or the body of a post (two 
counts per word), further subdivided by whether 
the word appears in any tags in the training data or 
not, and whether it is a synonym of known tag 
words. We extract the top five proposed tags for 
each post, corresponding to the five highest scoring 
SVM classifiers. 
We also attempt to detect the main entities being 
talked about. We perform shallow parsing and ex-
tract noun phrases and then proper nouns. The 
most frequent proper NPs are probable tags. We 
also added named entity recognition and co-
reference resolution using the OpenNLP toolkit 
(maxent.sourceforge.net). We found that 
named entity recognition proposes additional use-
ful tags while the effect of co-reference resolution 
is marginal, mostly because of limited success in 
actually matching co-referent entities. 
5 Results and Evaluation 
For evaluating our methods, we used 2,681 posts 
from Daily Kos and 571 posts from Red State. We 
compared the tags assigned by our tagger to the 
original tags of the blog post, using an automated 
method (Figure 1). A tag was considered a match if 
it exactly matched the original tag or was a word 
super set ? for example ?health care system? is 
considered a match to ?health care?. We also ma-
nually evaluated the relevance of the proposed tags 
on a small portion of our test set (100 posts).

6 Conclusion  
We described and evaluated a tool for automatical-
ly tagging political blog posts. Political blogs differ 
from other blogs as they often involve named enti-
ties (politicians, organizations, and places). There-
fore, tagging of political blog posts benefits from 
using basic name entity recognition to improve the 
tagging. The recall in particular exceeds the score 
obtained by earlier techniques applied to other do-
mains (Sood et al (2007) report precision of 13% 
and recall of 23%; Wang and Davison (2008) re-
port precision of 45% and recall of 23%).
