The experiments testing the theoretical adequacy 
and the practical usefulness of the Functional 
Generative Descript ion (FGD) are described. The 
FGD consists of a generative component, which, 
in the experimental version, has the shape of a 
context-free grammar combined with elements of 
dependency approach, and the other components 
having the form of pushdown store automata. The 
latter components have a transductive role, trans- 
ducing the semantie Ctectogrammatical) represent- 
ations of sentences to the lower levels of the 
language system. The transduction is articulated 
into several steps corresponding more or less to 
the levels of language system Csurface syntax, 
morphemics, morphophonemics, phonemics, or, as 
the case may be, graphemics) postulated in Europ- 
ean structural linguistics. The theoretical and 
practical qualit ies of the system are evaluated. 
i. The model of generative description called Functional Gener- 
ative Description CFGD) was proposed early in the sixties (Sgall, 
1964~, and it is worked out from that time by the'group of algebraic 
linguistics, Charles University, Prague. This description is being 
enriched and completed from the empirical point of view and from the 
point of view of i ts theoretical adequacy. TO allow for a systematic 
elaboration of both of these aspects, FGD is tested on computers in 
the form of random generation of semantic representations of Czech 
sentences and of transducing them to their outer shape. The computer 
testing fulfils also another aim: FGD, beside being an appropriate 
framework for empirical study and theoretical description of langua- 
ge, can also be applied as a background for practical projects, such 
as synthesis for machine translation into Czech, synthesis for ans- 
wers in question-answering systems etc. 
2. The main features distinguishing FGD from most of other 
linguistic frameworks are: (i) in FGD there is no place where trans- 
formationrules are needed~ Cii) the generative power is concentrated 
in its first component, generating underlying representations on 
the level of l inguistic meaning representing a specific patterning 
of extralinguistic, ontological content , the set of generated 
~trinqs surpassing only moderately the set of context-free lanquaqes 
(Pl~tek and Sgall, 1978)~ (iii) FGD is based on a dependency approach 
to svntax; (iv) a stratif icational approach is used here, articulat- 
ing the generation of sentences into several steps corresponding to 
particular language levels ordered from meaning to the outer shape

<level of tectogrammatics, of surface syntax, of morphemics,morpho- 
phonemics and at the end graphemics in our case, or the phonemic le- 
vel in a theoretical description). 
Describing the theoretical features of FGD it must be stressed 
that the description intself is being developed much more quickly 
than the system of programmes can reflect. The first component of FGD, 
generating tectogrammatical representations (TR's), was reformulated 
from the shape of formalism corresponding to context-free phrase 
structure grammar with elements of dependency features <Sga!l, 1967> 
into a pure dependency formalism using pushdown store automata and 
including also description of the topic/focus art iculation of the 
sentence (see Haji~ov~ and Sgall, 1980>. 
3. The component generating TR's was implemented in the older 
form, as a context-free grammar. The first experiments with random 
generation are restricted to a relatively small lexicon: something 
about 300 "deep" lexical units; the number of units increases on the 
surface level, where also function words are present, as well as the 
units gained by means of "syntactic" derivation in Kury~owicz (1936) 
sense (suff ixation and prefixation serving for nominalizons, etc.>. 
The enriched output lexicon consists of more than 1500 units. As for 
the grammatical phenomena concerning the different l inguistic levels, 
we tried to make the system relatively complete even in the first 
stage of the experiments; the coordinated constructions, the pronouns 
of the ist and 2nd person and some of the possible word order variants 
were Omitted in this stage. 
4. We concentrate our attention, first of all, on the transduct- 
ive components. All the l inguistical ly relevant semantic information 
is included in the TR's, where we have to do with disambiguated re- 
presentations, identical for all synonymous surface variants. This 
means that the transductive components describe the asymmetric dual- 
ism between a function and its forms (in the sense of Karcevskij, 
1929, and the Prague School of Linguistics, cf. Vachek, 1964). The 
relation between form and function may be i l lustrated by the follow- 
ing examples, concerning the relations between a TR and the correspond- 
ing surface syntactic representations and between these and the morph- 
emic ones: The participant actor may be expressed either by surface 
subject, or by an adverbial of actor (in passive constructions>, by 
a possessive adjective, or a noun in genitive or instrumental (with 
nominalizations>; the functor (Fil lmore's 'case'>Instrument may be 
expressed by the morphemic case of instrumental, or by preposit ional 
constructions n a + locative, pomocf + genitive. 
The mathematical  apparatus used for the transduction components 
of FGD is a sequence of pushdown store automata, transducing the TR 
into the surface representations <dependency trees> and the latter 
into morphemic ones <strings>; then follows a finite automaton trans- 
ducing the representation into the graphemic output form <there are 
some differences in this respect between the theoretical description 
of language and the procedure serving for applied projects>. On both 
levels of the structure of the sentence the dependency tree represent- 
ing the structural order has as its root the predicate of the main 
clause, which is the only one node not dependent on any other node. 
Every node is labelled by a representation of a single (autosemantic) 
word form, having the  shape of a complex symbol containing its syn- 
tactic, morphological  and lexical parts, corresponding to the char- 
acter of the particular level. The dependency tree preserves the ~on- 
dit ion of projectivity. 
Each transduction of the ~epresentation of the structure of the 
sentence to the adjacent level needs a pair of automata. The condit- 
RANDOM GENERATION OF CZECH SENTENCES 297 
ions constra in ing the t ransduct ion  to the next level can be charact -  
er ized as fol lows: 
<a> In a g iven step on ly  a s ingle dependency syntagm <the govern ing 
word and its modi f icat ion> is processed; one of the two steps ad- 
justs the morpho log ica l  features <cal led grammatemes,  cf. Panevov~, 
1979) 1980> in accordance wi th  certa in  propert ies  of the other  member  
Qf the syntagm; most ly  the mod i f ie r  changes according to the charact-  
er of its govern ing word: e.g. the actor of a pass ive verb comes over 
into an adverbial ,  that of a nomina l ized verb Ca surface noun> into 
an at t r ibute :host4  ~ i~ l i  - p~fchod host6 <the guests  arr ived - the 
arr ival  of the guests>. 
<b> A s ingle pass through the sentence <in the text - to - ru le  order> 
is suf f ic ient  for every transducer.  
<c> The process of t ransduct ion  is based on the govern ing unit  being 
handled by every pushdown automaton ear l ier  that its modi f i cat ions  
<dependent words>. We work with the new character is t ics  of the gov- 
erning word when its mod i f i ca t ions  are being processed. 
The main  programme <the def in ing funct ion> of every automaton 
is based on the fact that the root of every dependency tree is pro-  
cessed as first. <It should be noted that the l inear ized dependency 
tree is converted into the sequence "regens post rectum"; neverthe-  
less, not only this structura l  order, but also the l inear order ,more 
or le"s d i rect ly  corresponding to the surface <morphemic9 word order, 
are preserved in it>. Then the f i rst  member  f rom the r ight depending 
on the root is read by the automaton I and compared wi th  the root, 
i.e. modi f ied  according to its propert ies.  If the last word form read 
has no modi f iers ,  it may be pr inted on the output  from the given au- 
tomaton; if there is some modi f ier  present,  the govern ing word is 
p laced into the pushdown store and this pair  of word forms connected 
by the dependency re lat ion is then compared and evaluated.  This means 
that the matr ices  or tables descr ibed in deta i l  in Panevovl  <1979> 
are involved, where the changes ob l igatory  or opt ional  for the g iven 
pair  of word forms <syntagm> are determined.  These tables form an 
inner part  of the automaton,  which cannot  be separated from the work 
of the whole  procedure;  the empir ica l  data determin ing the choice of 
the means <forms> for funct ions <meanings> are involved here. The 
word form processed in a g iven t ime point  can be pr inted in the out-  
put only in such a point  when all the subtrees dependent  on it have 
a l ready been printed. On the output  of every pushdown t ransducer  but 
the last <i.e. w i th  the except ion of the morphemic  representat ion> 
we again receive an order of word forms adapted to the further pro-  
cess ing ~f the root of the tree as the f i rst  nod~;the modi fy ing  <de-  
pendent> nodes are read from the r ight side. 
5. We want to present  here a short survey of the l inguist ic  
problems solved by the indiv idual  automata: The f i rst  pair  of auto-  
mata chooses the act ive and pass ive construct ions,  non~inalization, 
in f in i t ive const ruct ion  or subord inate clause. Due to the opt iona l -  
ity of some rules <synonymy between e.g. Sna~i l  se , aby p~i~el  v~as-  
subord inate clause, Sna~i l  se p  i j i t  v~as - in f in i t ive construct ion,  
Sna~il  se o v~asn~ p  fch0d - nomina l ized form of He at tempted to come 
in time>, in the cases where we have to do wi th  the choice between 
several  equ iva lent  construct ions  a probab i l i ty  for part icu lar  poss ib-  
i l i t ies has been added <determined in a qui te pre l iminary  way, the 
resul ts  of which are being checked in the course of the exper iments>. 
The rules of choosing s imple or prepos i t iona l  cases, subordin-  
at ing conjunct ions,  etc. are a matter  of the t ransduct ion  from surf-  
ace syntax to morphemics.  There also the morphemic  uni ts  of number, 
verbal  aspect,  tense etc. are assigne4; e.g. w i th  the word forms 
character ized <by an index> as a "plurale tantum", any grammateme of 
298 J. PANEVOV.6 
number is ob l igator i l y  converted to plural  as a morphemic  unit: n~k\ [  
<scissors>, ka lhot  Z <trousers>. The rules of grammat ica l  congruence 
are also appl ied here <congruence between ad ject iva l  ad juncts  and 
their head noun, between subject and predicate,  etc.>. 
For the formulat ion  of such rules, of course, deta i led  empir ic -  
al studies about contextua l  condi t ions  in f luenc ing the choice of the 
par t icu lar  express ion  for instance of such under ly ing units as Actor,  
Instrument,  etc. are needed <Instrumenta l  case - ps~t ep_~,  prepos-  
i t ional  phrase n__aa + Loc - ps~t na psacfm stro~i, pomocf + Gen - p~e- 
lo~it pomqqf slovn/ku, etc., i.e. wr i te  wi th  a pen, wr i te  on a type- 
writer,  t rans late  by means of a d ict ionary,  respect ive ly ,  al l  corres-  
pond to Instrument>.  
The next step cons ists  in the procedure of morphemic  synthesis  
(see Weishe i te lov~,  1979) .This  procedure  is adapted to the purposes 
of pract ica l  projects,  so that a d i rect  t rans i t ion  to graphemics  is 
at tempted at. Here the st ructura l  order  is no more needed and the re- 
p resentat ion  of word forms prov ided wi th  in format ion on the morphemes 
inc luded can be submitted to the procedure of the combinat ion  of lex- 
ical stem <and, as the case may be, its a l ternat ions> with endings to 
create a correct  sequence of Czech word forms cor respond ing  to the 
meaning represented in the TR with which  the whole  procedure  of trans-  
duct ion  started. 
6. Some tectogrammat ica l  representat ions  of Czech sentences 
that were a l ready ga ined as a resu l t  of the funct ion ing of the proced-  
ure of random generat ion  at the computer  EC 1040 can serve as i l lustr -  
ations. Most  of them are correct  f rom the grammat ica l  point  of view, 
though their mean ingfu lness  can of ten be doubted;  however,  the con- 
straints on the semantic compat ib i l i ty  of lexical  units are - in our 
op in ion  - a mat ter  reaching beyond the l inguist ic  competence as such. 
The quest ions  of the  boundary  between these semant ic  se lect ion re- 
str ict ions and the grammat ica l  condi t ions  on str ict  subcategor i zat ion  
are by far not clear; this can be i l lust rated by the fo l l~wing examp-  
les the under ly ing trees cor respond ing  to which  were der ived by our 
system dur ing the f i rst  exper iments:  
N~co cht~lo mft  K ladno. -  Something wanted to have (the town of} 
Kladno. 
Pr~v~ n~co t~ i lo  ka~d4ho mu~e. -  Exact ly  something p leased eve- 
ry man. 
M~me rozvi t  sv~tek. - We have expanded a hol iday. 
Co byla pam~{ spodem? - What was the memory  from the bottom? 
Each of these sentences seems to be connected with specif ic  e\[~pirical 
problems concern ing the ment ioned  boundary,  and thus also the bounda-  
ry between the system of language and the domain of cognit ion.  Need-  
less to say, c lear ly  acceptab le  sentences were derived, too, by our 
system, such as: 
Ka~d4 ~ena vyr~b~la  n~ky .  - Every woman manufactured  scissors.  
Panovnfk  m~l b~t co nejkrat~f.  - The sovere ign should have been 
as short as possible.  
Musfme sezn~mit  s kva l i tou pam~{. - We must  make memory  
acqua inted  with qual ity.  
P~n vyrobi l  l ist/. - The gent leman manufactured  leaves. 
The system of programmes for the t ransduct ive  components  is ex- 
t remely complex and due to this fact the l ink ing of its part ia l  nro ~ 
grammes <procedures  and subprocedures)  for indiv idual  automata is a 
d i f f i cu l t  task from the point  of v iew of computer  storace and of the 
human work concern ing the debugging of the programmes.  A recent  
sample of computer  outputs  wi l l  be demonst ra ted  at the conference.

In the Appendix we present a slightly simplified representation of a 
Czech sentence on the different levels. The sequence of data in the 
complex symbo~ functioning as labels of a single node is as follows: 
part of speech, lexical item, indices Cbetween the signs ":" and 
";"), grammatemes <after the ";" sign). The correspondence between 
function and its expression Cform) on the adjacent level may be 
interpreted on the base of our example. The rules from which the 
correspondences between a function and its formCs) may be obtained 
on the basis of the main progranune of a pushdown transducer, or of 
its subprocedures having the form of tables, were characterized in
