Abstract 
In this paper we discuss morpho-syntactic 
clues that can be used to facilitate termi-
nological processing in Serbian. A 
method (called SRCE) for automatic ex-
traction of multiword terms is presented. 
The approach incorporates a set of ge-
neric morpho-syntactic filters for recogni-
tion of term candidates, a method for 
conflation of morphological variants and 
a module for foreign word recognition. 
Morpho-syntactic filters describe general 
term formation patterns, and are imple-
mented as generic regular expressions. 
The inner structure together with the 
agreements within term candidates are 
used as clues to discover the boundaries 
of nested terms. The results of the termi-
nological processing of a textbook corpus 
in the domains of mathematics and com-
puter science are presented.  
1 Introduction 
An overwhelming amount of textual information 
presented in newswire, scientific literature, legal 
texts, etc., makes it difficult for a human to effi-
ciently localise the information of interest. In 
particular, it is doubtful that anybody could proc-
ess such huge amount of information without an 
automated help, especially when the information 
content spans across domains. The amount of e-
documents and their fuzzy structure require 
effective tools that can help users to 
systematically gather and make use of the 
information encoded in text documents. For these 
reasons, different text and/or literature mining 
techniques have been developed recently (e.g. 
(Hearst et al, 2000; Grobelnik et al, 2000)) in 
order to facilitate efficient discovery of knowl-
cient discovery of knowledge contained in large 
scientific or legal text collections. The main goal 
is to retrieve the knowledge ?buried? in a text 
and to present it to users in a digested form.  
The discovery (and transfer) of knowledge re-
lies heavily on the identification of relevant con-
cepts, which are linguistically represented by 
domain specific terms. Terms represent the most 
important notions in a domain and characterise 
documents semantically, and thus should be used 
as a basis for sophisticated knowledge acquisi-
tion. Still, few text-mining systems incorporate 
deep and dynamic terminology processing, al-
though there is an increasing amount of new 
terms that represent newly created concepts in 
rapidly developing fields. Existing term diction-
aries and standardised terminologies offer only a 
partial solution, as they are almost never up-to-
date. Although naming conventions do exist for 
some types of concepts (e.g. gene and protein 
names in biomedicine), these are only guidelines 
and as such do not impose restrictions to domain 
experts, who frequently introduce ad-hoc terms. 
Thus, the lack of clear naming conventions 
makes the automatic term recognition (ATR) task 
difficult even for languages that are not morpho-
logically and derivationally rich.  
ATR tools have been developed for English 
(Frantzi et al, 2000), French (Jacquemin, 2001), 
Japanese (Nakagawa and Mori, 2000), etc. Some 
methods rely purely on linguistic information, 
namely morpho-syntactic features of term candi-
dates (Ananiadou, 1994). Hybrid approaches 
combining linguistic patterns and statistical 
measures (e.g. (Frantzi et al, 2000)) and ma-
chine-learning techniques (e.g. (Hatzivassiloglou 
et al, 2001)) have been also used.  
However, few studies have been done for 
morphologically rich Slavic languages. For ex-
ample, Vintar (2000) presented two methods for 
extraction of terminological collocations in order 
to assist the translation process in Slovene. The 
statistical approach was based on the mutual ex-
pectation and LocalMax measures, and involved 
collocation extraction from raw text. The ex-
tracted collocations were filtered with a stop-
word list, and only collocations containing sin-
gle-word terms (devised previously by bilingual 
alignment) were accepted as relevant. In another 
approach, she used regular expression patterns to 
extract term collocations from a morpho-
syntactically tagged corpus. However, these pat-
terns are too general, and consequently not all 
extracted phrases were terminologically relevant.  
In this paper we discuss automatic terminology 
recognition in Serbian, in particular, the extrac-
tion of multiword terms, which are very frequent1 
in certain domains (e.g. natural sciences, mathe-
matics, etc.). Since Serbian is a highly inflective 
and morphologically and derivationally rich lan-
guage, morpho-syntactic clues are indispensable 
in the ATR process. Our hybrid approach (called 
SRCE ? Serbian C-value) combines morpho-
syntactic features of term candidates and statisti-
cal analysis of their occurrences in text. In addi-
tion, since terms appear in texts in many different 
forms due to their morphological and derivational 
variations, the necessity of taking these variations 
into account becomes particularly apparent. 
Therefore, the SRCE method incorporates generic 
morpho-syntactic patterns, a term normalisation 
approach and a foreign word detection method.  
The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 
we present an overview of the core term extrac-
tion method, called the C-value method. In Sec-
tion 3 we discuss morpho-syntactic clues, the 
normalisation approach and the foreign word 
recognition that are used for singling out terms in 
Serbian. The experiments and evaluation are de-
scribed in Section 4. 
 
2 Automatic Term Recognition: the core 
C-value method 
Our approach to ATR is based on the C-value 
method (Frantzi et al, 2000), which extracts 
multi-word terms. It is a general term recognition 
approach in the sense that it is not limited to spe-
cific classes of concepts. The approach is hybrid: 
the method combines linguistic knowledge (term 
                                                           
1 In English, more than 85% of domain-specific terms are 
multi-words (Nakagawa and Mori, 2000).  
formation patterns) and statistical analysis. Lin-
guistic knowledge is used to single out term can-
didates, while their statistical features are used to 
measure the likelihood of term candidates being 
?real? terms. The method uses a POS tagged text 
as input, and outputs a list of extracted terms 
ranked according to their termhoods. Termhood 
is a numeric estimation of the degree to which a 
given linguistic unit (a multiword compound) is 
related to a domain-specific concept. However, 
the values are not normalised in the sense that a 
multiword, having a termhood value 10, is 10 
times more likely to be a term than a term candi-
date with a termhood value 1.  
In general, the C-value method enhances the 
commonly used baseline method that extracts 
most frequent term candidates (assuming that 
termhoods directly correspond to frequencies of 
occurrence) by making it sensitive to a particular 
type of terms ? nested terms2.   
The method is implemented as a two-step pro-
cedure. In the first step, term candidates are ex-
tracted using a set of morpho-syntactic filters, 
which describe general term formation patterns in 
a given language. As a rule, terms form a proper 
subset of noun phrases (NPs). For example, a set 
of general filters for English may include the fol-
lowing patterns:3 
 
Noun+ Noun  
(Adj | Noun)+ Noun  
(Adj | Noun)+| ((Adj | Noun)* Prep?) (Adj | Noun)* Noun  
 
Although these patterns are regular expressions, 
the filters are implemented as unification-like 
LR(1) rules (Mima et al, 1995) in order to facili-
tate processing of grammatical agreements (if 
any) within term candidates.  
For each term candidate extracted by a filter, a 
set of nested term candidates is generated (see 
Table 1 for an example in English). The proce-
dure for the generation of nested term candidates 
is implemented via transformation rules for each 
morpho-syntactic filter that is used to extract 
                                                           
2 For example, nuclear receptor is a nested term in hormone 
nuclear receptor. Similarly, baza podataka (Engl. database) 
is a nested term in a?uriranje baze podataka (Engl. update of 
database).  
3 Noun, Adj and Prep denote POS tags that correspond to 
nouns, adjectives and prepositions respectively. These filters 
were used for ATR from newswire corpora and in biomedi-
cine (Frantzi et al, 2000; Nenadi? et al, 2002).  
term candidates. The main indicator that a nested 
term candidate might be a real term is that it also 
appears on its own in the corpus.

Table 1: Nested term candidates 
 
In the second step, the term candidates are as-
signed termhoods (referred to as C-values) ac-
cording to a statistical measure. The measure 
amalgamates four numerical corpus-based char-
acteristic of a candidate term, namely the fre-
quency of occurrence, the frequency of occurring 
as nested within other candidate terms, the num-
ber of candidate terms inside which the given 
candidate term is nested, and the number of 
words contained in the candidate term. Formally,  
where a denotes a term candidate, f(a) corre-
sponds to its frequency, |a| denotes the number of 
words in a, and Ta is a set of terms that contain 
term a as a nested term. Term candidates are 
ranked according to their C-values, and terms 
whose C-values are higher than a chosen thresh-
old are presented as terms. 
Evaluation of the C-value method for English 
has shown that using additional statistical infor-
mation (frequency of ?nestedness?) improves the 
precision with slight loss on recall (Frantzi et al, 
2000). Also, systematic term normalisation may 
further improve precision and recall of the 
method (Nenadi? et al, 2002). 
3 Morpho-syntactic clues for extraction 
of terms in Serbian 
In order to adjust the core C-value method for 
Serbian, we have defined an appropriate set of 
morpho-syntactic filters and rules for inflectional 
normalisation of term candidates, and, addition-
ally, a module for foreign word recognition.  
3.1 Term formation patterns 
As a rule, the vast majority of multiword terms in 
Serbian match the following general formation 
pattern:4 
 
(1)           (Adj | ProAdj | Num | Noun )+ Noun 
 
which has been used for recognition of NPs in 
Serbian (Nenadi? and Vitas, 1998a). Of course, 
not all NPs that follow this pattern are terms.5 
Moreover, when applied to an initially POS 
tagged text6, this pattern may be too general even 
for description of NPs, as not all word sequences 
in a text that match this pattern are valid NPs. For 
example, in a sequence koji se naziva relacioni 
model (Engl. which is called the relational 
model), a word naziva can be initially tagged ei-
ther as a noun naziv (Engl. name) or a verb na-
zivati (Engl. call), although, in this sentence, only 
the latter is correct. Thus, without further POS 
disambiguation, the string naziva relacioni model 
follows the pattern (1), although it is not a valid 
NP. This means that classical regular expressions 
are not sufficient for the representation of such 
constraints, and that we need more expressive 
means to model constraints related to the NP 
structure and agreements of multiword constitu-
ents on case, number and gender. We used the 
notion of generic patterns as an extension of 
regular expressions (Nenadi? and Vitas, 1998b). 
For example, a generic pattern 
 
(2)      Adj.x1y1z1  Noun.x1y1z1   Adj.x2y2g   Noun.x2y2g 
 
models obligatory agreements that each NP from 
a specific class has to fulfil: both first and second 
pairs of adjectives and nouns must have the same 
values for certain morphological features (i.e. 
values for gender, number and case denoted by xi, 
                                                           
4 ProAdj and Num denote possessive adjectives and numbers 
respectively. 
5 For example, ovaj na?in (Engl. this way), veliki deo (Engl. 
large part), etc. This is a reason why we need additional 
processing to recognise semantically relevant NPs. 
6 Initially (or lexically) tagged POS text is a text in which 
every word occurrence is associated with all of its possible 
lexical and grammatical interpretations. The initial POS 
tagging is intrinsically ambiguous as each word is analysed 
separately, without considering neighbouring words (Ne-
nadi? and Vitas, 1998a). Thus, as a result of initial tagging, a 
lot of lexical ambiguities arise resulting in highly ambiguous 
word sequences. See Section 4 for further discussion.

a af a
a value C 
yi and zi respectively), while these values may be 
different for each respective pair. The last adjec-
tive and noun are ?frozen? in the genitive case 
(g), while the case (z1) in the first pair is ?free?. 
By defining generic patterns one can model the 
agreements within various lexical structures in a 
highly inflective language such as Serbian (Ne-
nadi? and Vitas, 1998b). As a result, these 
agreements can be used to detect the boundaries 
of the structures in questions. 
A set of generic patterns has been used to 
model the most frequent term formation patterns 
in Serbian. The set is mainly based on patterns 
used to model NPs in Serbian. Table 2 presents 
some of them. First four patterns describe NPs 
containing a nested NP whose lexical properties 
(such as case and/or number) are invariant in all 
inflected forms of the host NP. As a rule, the fro-
zen part is in genitive. Depending on NP con-
stituents, some agreements are obligatory within 
frozen part (see, for example, the third pattern ? 
agreements between an adjective and the corre-
sponding noun), or not (see the fourth pattern ? 
no necessary agreement between the last two 
nouns in gender, number). The fifth pattern (Ta-
ble 2) corresponds to NPs that do not have in-
variant parts.

5 A1+  N1 pro?ireni relacioni model  kompletan metri?ki  prostor 
Table 2: Frequent term formation patterns7 
 
While these patterns are used to single out 
term candidates from an initially tagged text, 
agreements within NPs are used to generate pos-
sible nested structures. While the rules for nested 
structures are more ?blurred? in English (since 
                                                           
7 In order to improve readability of filters, the generic pat-
terns in this table are encoded using the following syntax: A 
and N stand for Adj and Noun respectively, while X1 stands 
for X.x1y1z1 , Xgen stands for X.xyg and X2;gen stands for 
X.x2y2g (for X ? {A, N}). Also, invariant parts are underlined 
in the given examples. 
 
nouns are usually used as modifiers), ?nested-
ness? in Serbian has to preserve the necessary 
structure and inner agreements, which are spe-
cific for the NP class in question. Therefore, gen-
eration of nested term candidates depends on the 
type of host term candidates (consider examples 
in Table 3). Nested structures that are not them-
selves NPs are not considered as term candidates.

3.2 Conflating morphological variants 
If we aim at systematic recognition of terms, then 
handling term variation has to be treated as an 
essential part of terminology retrieval. Term 
variation ranges from simple orthographic (e.g. 
oestrogen ? estrogen, vitamin ? vitamine) and 
morphological variants (e.g. clone ? clones) to 
more complex semantic variation (e.g. eye sur-
gery ? ophthalmologic surgery).  
Several methods for term variation manage-
ment have been developed. For example, the 
BLAST system (Krauthammer et al, 2000) used 
approximate text string matching techniques and 
dictionaries to recognise spelling variations in 
gene and protein names. FASTR (Jacquemin, 
2001) handles morphological and syntactic varia-
tions by means of meta-rules used to describe 
term normalisation, while semantic variants are 
handled via WordNet.  
The necessity of taking term variants into ac-
count as part of ATR process becomes particu-
larly apparent in highly inflective languages. In 
Serbian, for example, the simplest morphological 
variations generally give rise to 14 possible vari-
ants of a single term (seven cases and two num-
bers (singular and plural) ? see Table 4). If the 
core C-value method were to be applied without 
conflating morphological variants, then term-
hoods would be distributed across different mor-
phological variants providing separate 
frequencies for individual variants instead of a 
single frequency calculated for a term candidate 
unifying all of its variants. In addition, the ?nest-
ing? factor of the C-value method would cause 
skewed results, since the case property of nested 
terms does not have normal distribution. Namely, 
as indicated previously (see Table 2), the major-
ity of nested terms in Serbian are in genitive case, 
which means that the termhood for a term candi-
date in genitive case would differ significantly 
from its counterparts in other cases. Moreover, 
this deviation cannot be remedied later by sum-
ming up individual termhoods, since C-value is 
not an additive measure. Hence, in order for the 
C-value method to be applied correctly in a 
highly inflective language, term candidates must 
be (at least inflectionally) normalised prior to the 
calculation of termhoods.

operacijo prirodnog spajanja (vs) 
operacijom prirodnog spajanja (is) 
operacijama prirodnog spajanja (dp;ip;lp) 
Normalised form: 
    operacija (ns) prirodno (nsm) spajanje (ns)  
 
Table 4: Variants and normalisation of term 
candidates ? an example for term operacija prirod-
nog spajanja (Engl. natural join operation) 
 
Our approach to morphological normalisation 
of term variants is based on the normalisation of 
individual term constituents. Namely, each word 
that is a part of a term candidate is mapped onto 
its lemma, and term candidates are treated as se-
quences of lemmas. At the end of the ATR proc-
ess, terms are converted into their canonical form 
(singular, nominative case), which is not neces-
sarily identical to the normalised form (the se-
quence of the corresponding singular words in 
singular, nominative case). The normalisation 
process is illustrated in Table 4. 
At this point, the usage of generic patterns in 
order to check the agreements in case, number 
and gender during the phase of filtering of term 
candidates might seem unnecessary, since all 
these features are subsequently normalised. How-
ever, in order to enhance the precision of the 
SRCE method, it is important for term candidates 
to be correctly recognised prior to the statistical 
analysis. This means that the necessary agree-
ments between NP constituents have to be 
checked. Once the term candidates are identified, 
they are normalised in order to make the most of 
the statistical part of the method.   
3.3 Foreign word detection 
Despite the efforts to rely mostly on Serbian vo-
cabulary when building a terminology, many of 
the terms used in specific scientific domains bor-
row some of their building blocks from lan-
guages other than Serbian at various levels. For 
example, at morphological level, foreign suffixes, 
mostly originating from Latin and Greek, are of-
ten ?preferred? to their Serbian counterparts in, 
for example, the biomedical domain, even when 
they are used to modify a root that is in fact Ser-
bian (e.g. amino-kiselina (Engl. amino acid)). 
Similarly, at lexical level, words of foreign origin 
are used to form multi-word terms (e.g. redun-
dantan atribut (Engl. redundant attribute)). This 
is particularly obvious in fairly recently expanded 
disciplines such as computer science, where, for 
many of the original terms used in English, it has 
not been simple to adapt new terms in Serbian. 
Consequently, many of the terms have been sim-
ply transcribed into Serbian or, even worse, they 
are still used in their original form. Not only do 
foreign words appear as ?valid? parts of terms, 
but they have also proved to be good indicators 
of terms. It is, thus, necessary to develop proce-
dures for their detection.  
In our approach, the recognition of foreign 
words has been integrated into the ATR process 
for Serbian. The following morphological fea-
tures are used to indicate occurrences of potential 
foreign words (Spasi?, 1996): 
 
? characters (e.g. x, y, q) that do not belong to 
Serbian graphemic system, 
? successive vowel occurrences, 
? exception to the palatalisation rule,   
? exception to the assimilation rules, 
? occurrence of atypical consonant bi/tri-grams  
? occurrence of bi-grams or tri-grams typical 
for other languages (especially Latin and 
English), and 
? foreign affixes. 
 
The words satisfying some of the above crite-
ria are not necessarily foreign words. The preci-
sion of these rules varies from one to another. For 
example, the first rule is the strongest indicator of 
the presence of foreign words, since the alpha-
betical system used is not Serbian. Other rules 
may be tuned to a certain extent in order to in-
crease their precision.  
Let us, for instance, consider the second rule. 
The successive usage of vowels is fairly frequent 
in Serbian, but the majority of such cases follow 
certain restrictions8 under which they can occur. 
Moreover, these restrictions can be described by 
regular expressions. Any other occurrence of 
successive vowels can be used to indicate a po-
tential foreign word. 
Foreign word detection has been incorporated 
into the ATR process in two ways: during the 
selection of term candidates and for the calcula-
tion of termhoods. First, it is used before the ini-
tial POS tagging process in order to locate 
foreign words, which are tagged accordingly. 
Otherwise, foreign words would be typically 
considered as unknown. As explained earlier, it is 
very likely for foreign words in Serbian scientific 
and technical texts to be related to domain-
specific concepts, and their mishandling would 
significantly decrease the recall of the ATR 
method. This information is used by the linguistic 
part of the SRCE-method, where we introduced a 
special category corresponding to foreign words.  
In the second step, that is - once the term can-
didates have been selected - the information 
about foreign origin is used to increase the term-
hood of term candidates containing such words. 
This time, foreign word recognition is used to 
improve the precision of the ATR method. 
                                                           
8 For example, verbs in the paste tense, masculine gender 
always end with a pair of vowels (e.g. ispitivao (Engl. exam-
ined)). Further, some adjectives in masculine gender (e.g. 
beo (Engl. white)), as well as some nouns in masculine gen-
der (e.g. smisao (Engl. sense)) also end with a pair of vow-
els. The usage of prefixes is another example where vowels 
may occur successively (e.g. za+ustaviti (Engl. to stop)). 
4 Experiments and discussion 
The preliminary ATR experiments were con-
ducted using the SRCE system on a corpus con-
taining samples from university textbooks in 
mathematics9 and computer science10 (altogether 
120k words). 
Texts were pre-processed, i.e. initially tagged, 
by a system of electronic dictionaries (e-
dictionaries) containing simple nominal words 
for Serbian (Vitas, 1993). E-dictionaries contain 
exhaustive description of morpho-syntactic 
characteristics and are used for lexical 
recognition and initial lemmatisation of words 
that occur in a text.  This process is realised by e-
dictionary look-up, which results in an initially 
tagged text: each textual word is associated with 
its lemma(s) and corresponding morpho-syntactic 
categories (tags) retrieved from the  
e-dictionary. In general, e-dictionaries cannot 
resolve lexical ambiguities that result from the 
fact that there is no one-to-one correspondence 
between word forms and their morpho-syntactic 
features. There are different methods to resolve 
ambiguities (e.g. cache-dictionaries or local 
grammars), but in our experiments no disam-
biguation techniques were applied.  
In order to extract a list of term candidates, the 
set of morpho-syntactic filters described in 3.1 
was applied to the initially tagged corpus. We 
performed two sets of experiments. 
In the first experiment, we did not use any 
stoplist to discard unwanted constituents of term 
candidates. For each term candidate, we gener-
ated a canonical form (nominative, singular), a 
morphologically normalised form (list of normal-
ised words comprising the term candidate) and a 
list of nested term candidates (see Table 3 for 
examples).  In the next step, C-values for term 
candidates were calculated using statistics based 
on occurrences of normalised forms, and all term 
candidates with C-values above an empirically 
chosen threshold were selected as terms.  
Table 5 gives some examples of the recognised 
terms. In order to calculate the precision, we ex-

corpora in mathematical analysis and computer 
science (see Table 6). Intervals are sets of recog-
nised terms that are placed at certain positions 
within the list. For example, interval 1-50 con-
tains top 50 terms, while the interval over 150 
contains all terms whose positions in the list are 
above 150. Terms have been inspected by the 
first two authors, who are Serbian native speakers

In the first 50 terms for the domain of mathe-
matical analysis, there was only one false term 
candidate (specijalna klasa neprekidnih pres-
likavanja), which contained an ?unwanted? adjec-
tive specijalna (Engl. special). The reason for the 
significant drop in the precision in the second and 
third intervals is mainly the same: apart from few 
true negatives11, the majority of false term candi-
dates contained common ?unwanted? constitu-
ents, which are sampled in Table 7. The results 
for the computer science sub-corpus were slightly 
worse since the mathematical language seems to 
be more consistent and restricted.

In the second experiment, we used a stoplist 
containing the words detected as frequent 
?wrong? constituents in the previous experi-
ments. The results are summarised in Table 8.

The majority of remaining errors originate 
from the ambiguous POS tagging (more than 
50%, problematic words being naziv(a), igra, 
kod, etc.). Since no further processing of text has 
been performed, another source of problems is 
the detection of boundaries of frozen parts in 
prepositional phrases (e.g. na osnovu (Engl. 
based on), u slu?aju (Engl. in the case of)), 
which may be resolved by using a set of corre-
sponding local grammars (Nenadi? and Vitas, 
1998b). In addition, for the computer science 
domain, some of the false terms were related to a 
specific application area (the text intensively 
used examples from a university information sys-
tem, so candidates such as zvanje nastavnika 
(Engl. lecturer position), godina studija (Engl. 
year of study), etc. were wrongly suggested as 
computer science terms). 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper we have presented an approach to 
automatic extraction of terminology in a morpho-
logically rich language, such as Serbian. Terms 
extracted automatically may be used as semantic 
indicators for a range of classic IR/IE tasks. 
The approach is hybrid: it combines morpho-
syntactic filters for extraction of term candidates, 
and statistical analysis that ranks term candidates 
according to their termhood.  
Extraction of term candidates is based on the 
recognition of proper NPs. In order to enhance 
both the precision and recall of the ATR method, 
it is inevitable to incorporate significant linguistic 
knowledge. Since describing NPs by means of 
regular expressions is not sufficient for modelling 
agreements between NP constituents, we have 
used generic morpho-syntactic patterns. Further, 
since not all NPs are terms that semantically 
characterise documents, we have used a statisti-
cal measure in order to estimate semantic signifi-
cance of term candidates. Also, once the term 
candidates are correctly identified, they are nor-
malised in order to make the most of the statisti-
cal part of the method. Term candidates 
suggested as terms by the statistical part of the 
SRCE method are finally mapped into the canoni-
cal form of the original term. 
The preliminary experiments show that the 
precision is in line with the results for English, 
and that for the top ranked terms the precision is 
well above 90%. The analysis of errors shows 
that the majority of them appear due to lexical 
ambiguity of the input text. Certainly, if the cor-
pora were lexically disambiguated, we would 
have better precision.  
In order to improve the recall, additional mor-
pho-syntactic filters need to be identified. In par-
ticular, we plan to study terms that contain 
prepositions, as this is a common formation pat-
tern in many domains. Further, the broader han-
dling of term variants (e.g. dialectic variants, 
acronyms, derivational variants) may also im-
prove both precision and recall. Currently we 
deal only with inflectional variants by mapping 
them to a canonical form. Term variants unifica-
tion and normalisation also provide a broader 
basis for further IR and IE tasks, as queries can 
be expanded by referring to a class of synony-
mous terms as opposed to a single term.
