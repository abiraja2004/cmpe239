Abstract
In this paper, we describe a resource-light system
for the automatic morphological analysis and tag-
ging of Russian. We eschew the use of extensive
resources (particularly, large annotated corpora and
lexicons), exploiting instead (i) pre-existing anno-
tated corpora of Czech; (ii) an unannotated corpus
of Russian. We show that our approach has benefits,
and present what we believe to be one of the first full
evaluations of a Russian tagger in the openly avail-
able literature.
1 Introduction
Morphological processing and part-of-speech tag-
ging are essential for many NLP tasks, including
machine translation, information retrieval and pars-
ing. In this paper, we describe a resource-light ap-
proach to the tagging of Russian. Because Russian
is a highly inflected language with a high degree
of morpheme homonymy (cf. Table 11) the tags in-
volved are more numerous and elaborate than those
typically used for English. This complicates the tag-
ging task, although as has been previously noted
(Elworthy, 1995), the increased complexity of the
tags does not necessarily translate into a more de-
manding tagging task. Because no large annotated
corpora of Russian are available to us, we instead
chose to use an annotated corpus of Czech. Czech
is sufficiently similar to Russian that it is reasonable
to suppose that information about Czech will be rel-
evant in some way to the tagging of Russian.
The languages share many linguistic properties (free
word order and a rich morphology which plays
a considerable role in determining agreement and
argument relationships). We created a morpho-
logical analyzer for Russian, combined the results
with information derived from Czech and used the
TnT (Brants, 2000) tagger in a number of differ-
1All Russian examples in this paper are transcribed in the
Roman alphabet. Our system is able to analyze Russian texts
in both Cyrillic and various transcriptions.

okn-a window (noun, neuter, sing., genitive)

ent ways, including a a committee-based approach,
which turned out to give the best results. To eval-
uate the results, we morphologically annotated (by
hand) a small corpus of Russian: part of the transla-
tion of Orwell?s ?1984? from the MULTEXT-EAST
project (Ve?ronis, 1996).
2 Why TnT?
Readers may wonder why we chose to use TnT,
which was not designed for Slavic languages. The
short answer is that it is convenient and successful,
but the following two sections address the issue in
rather more detail.
2.1 The encoding of lexical information in TnT
TnT records some lexical information in the emis-
sion probabilities of its second order Markov
Model. Since Russian and Czech do not use the
same words we cannot use this information (at least
not directly) to tag Russian. Given this, the move
from Czech to Russian involves a loss of detailed
lexical information. Therefore we implemented a
morphological analyzer for Russian, the output of
which we use to provide surrogate emission proba-
bilities for the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000). The de-
tails are described below in section 4.2.
2.2 The modelling of word order in TnT
Both Russian and Czech have relatively free word
order, so it may seem an odd choice to use a Markov
model (MM) tagger. Why should second order
MM be able to capture useful facts about such lan-
guages? Firstly, even if a language has the poten-
tial for free word order, it may still turn out that
there are recurring patterns in the progressions of
parts-of-speech attested in a training corpus. Sec-
ondly, n-gram models including MM have indeed
been shown to be successful for various Slavic lan-
guages, e.g., Czech (Hajic? et al, 2001) or Slovene
(Dz?eroski et al, 2000); although not as much as
for English. This shows that the transitional in-
formation captured by the second-order MM from
a Czech or Slovene corpus is useful for Czech or
Slovene.2 The present paper shows that transitional
information acquired from Czech is also useful for
Russian.
3 Russian versus Czech
A deep comparative analysis of Czech and Russian
is far beyond the scope of this paper. However, we
would like to mention just a number of the most im-
portant facts. Both languages are Slavic (Czech is
West Slavonic, Russian is East Slavonic). Both have
extensive morphology whose role is important in
determining the grammatical functions of phrases.
In both languages, the main verb agrees in person
and number with subject; adjectives agree in gen-
der, number and case with nouns. Both languages
are free constituent order languages. The word or-
der in a sentence is determined mainly by discourse.
It turns out that the word order in Czech and Russian
is very similar. For instance, old information mostly
precedes new information. The ?neutral? order in
the two languages is Subject-Verb-Object. Here is a
parallel Czech-Russian example from our develop-
ment corpus:

generalize, probably also irrespectively.

Of course, not all utterances are so similar. Sec-
tion 5.4 briefly mentions how to improve the utility
of the corpus by eradicating some of the systematic
differences.
4 Realization
4.1 The tag system
We adopted the Czech tag system (Hajic?, 2000) for
Russian. Every tag is represented as a string of 15
symbols each corresponding to one morphological
category. For example, the word vidjela is assigned
the tag VpFS- - -XR-AA- - -, because it is a verb (V),
past participle (p), feminine (F), singular (S), does
not distinguish case (-), possessive gender (-), pos-
sessive number (-), can be any person (X), is past
tense (R), is not gradable (-), affirmative (A), active
voice (A), and does not have any stylistic variants
(the final hyphen).

Table 2: Overview and comparison of the tagsets
The tagset used for Czech (4290+ tags) is larger
than the tagset we use for Russian (about 900 tags).
There is a good theoretical reason for this choice
? Russian morphological categories usually have
fewer values (e.g., 6 cases in Russian vs. 7 in Czech;
Czech often has formal and colloquial variants of
the same morpheme); but there is also an immedi-
ate practical reason ? the Czech tag system is very
elaborate and specifically devised to serve multiple
needs, while our tagset is designed solely to capture
the core of Russian morphology, as we need it for
our primary purpose of demonstrating the portabil-
ity and feasibility of our technique. Still, our tagset
is much larger than the Penn Treebank tagset, which
uses only 36 non-punctuation tags (Marcus et al,
1993).
4.2 Morphological analysis
In this section we describe our approach to a
resource-light encoding of salient facts about the
Russian lexicon. Our techniques are not as rad-
ical as previously explored unsupervised methods
(Goldsmith, 2001; Yarowsky and Wicentowski,
2000), but are designed to be feasible for languages
for which serious morphological expertise is un-
available to us. We use a paradigm-based morphol-
ogy that avoids the need to explicitly create a large
lexicon. The price that we pay for this is overgener-
ation. Most of these analyses look very implausible
to a Russian speaker, but significantly increasing the
precision would be at the cost of greater develop-
ment time than our resource-light approach is able
to commit. We wish our work to be portable at least
to other Slavic languages, for which we assume that
elaborate morphological analyzers will not be avail-
able. We do use two simple pre-processing methods
to decrease the ambiguity of the results handed to
the tagger ? longest ending filtering and an automat-
ically acquired lexicon of stems. These were easy to
implement and surprisingly effective.
Our analyzer captures just a few textbook facts
about the Russian morphology (Wade, 1992), ex-
cluding the majority of exceptions and including in-
formation about 4 declension classes of nouns, 3
conjugation classes of verbs. In total our database
contains 80 paradigms. A paradigm is a set of end-
ings and POS tags that can go with a particular set
of stems. Thus, for example, the paradigm in Table
3 is a set of inflections that go with the masculine
stems ending on the ?hard? consonants, e.g., slon
?elephant?, stol ?table?.
Unlike the traditional notions of stem and ending,
for us a stem is the part of the word that does not
change within its paradigm, and the ending is the
part of the word that follows such a stem. For ex-
ample, the forms of the verb moc?? ?can.INF?: mogu
?1sg?, moz?es?? ?2sg?, moz?et ?3sg?, etc. are analyzed as
0 NNMS1 - - - - - - - - - - y NNMP1 - - - - - - - - - -
a NNMS2 - - - - - - - - - - ov NNMP2 - - - - - - - - - -

Table 3: A paradigm for ?hard? consonant mascu-
line nouns
the stem mo followed by the endings gu, z?es??, z?et. A
more linguistically oriented analysis would involve
the endings u, es??, et and phonological alternations
in the stem. All stem internal variations are treated
as suppletion.3
Unlike the morphological analyzers that exist for
Russian (Segalovich and Titov, 2000; Segalovich,
2003; Segalovich and Maslov, 1989; Kovalev, 2002;
Mikheev and Liubushkina, 1995; Yablonsky, 1999;
Segalovich, 2003; Kovalev, 2002, among others)
(Segalovich, 2003; Kovalev, 2002; Mikheev and Li-
ubushkina, 1995; Yablonsky, 1999, among others),
our analyzer does not rely on a substantial manu-
ally created lexicon. This is in keeping with our aim
of being resource-light. When analyzing a word,
the system first checks a list of monomorphemic
closed-class words and then segments the word into
all possible prefix-stem-ending triples.4 The result
has quite good coverage (95.4%), but the average
ambiguity is very high (10.9 tags/token), and even
higher for open class words. We therefore have two
strategies for reducing ambiguity.
4.2.1 Longest ending filtering (LEF)
The first approach to ambiguity reduction is based
on a simple heuristic ? the correct ending is usually
one of the longest candidate endings. In English, it
would mean that if a word is analyzed either as hav-
ing a zero ending or an -ing ending, we would con-
sider only the latter; obviously, in the vast majority
of cases that would be the correct analysis. In addi-
tion, we specify that a few long but very rare end-
ings should not be included in the maximum length
calculation (e.g., 2nd person pl. imperative).
3We do in fact have a very similar analysis, the analyzer?s
run-time representation of the paradigms is automatically pro-
duced from a more compact and linguistically attractive spec-
ification of the paradigms. It is possible to specify the ba-
sic paradigms and then specify the subparadigms, exceptions
and paradigms involving phonological changes by referring to
them.
4Currently, we consider only two inflectional prefixes ? neg-
ative ne and superlative nai.
4.2.2 Deriving a lexicon
The second approach uses a large raw corpus5 to
generate an open class lexicon of possible stems
with their paradigms. In this paper, we can only
sketch the method, for more details see (Hana and
Feldman, to appear). It is based on the idea that
open-class lemmata are likely to occur in more than
one form. First, we run the morphological analyzer
on the text (without any filtering), then we add to
the lexicon those entries that occurred with at least a
certain number of distinct forms and cover the high-
est number of forms. If we encounter the word talk-
ing, using the information about paradigms, we can
assume that it is either the -ing form of the lemma
talk or that it is a monomorphemic word (such as
sibling). Based on this single form we cannot really
say more. However, if we also encounter the forms
talk, talks and talked, the former analysis seems
more probable; and therefore, it seems reasonable
to include the lemma talk as a verb into the lexi-
con. If we encountered also talkings, talkinged and
talkinging, we would include both lemmata talk and
talking as verbs.
Obviously, morphological analysis based on such
a lexicon overgenerates, but it overgenerates much
less than if based on the endings alone. For ex-
ample, for the word form partii of the lemma par-
tija ?party?, our analysis gives 8 possibilities ? the
5 correct ones (noun fem sg gen/dat/loc sg and pl
nom/acc) and 3 incorrect ones (noun masc sg loc,
pl nom, and noun neut pl acc; note that only gen-
der is incorrect). Analysis based on endings alone
would allow 20 possibilities ? 15 of them incorrect
(including adjectives and an imperative).
4.3 Tagging
We use the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000), an imple-
mentation of the Viterbi algorithm for second order
Markov models. We train the transition probabili-
ties on Czech (1.5M tokens of the Prague Depen-
dency Treebank (Be?mova? et al, 1999)). We ob-
tain surrogate emission probabilities by running our
morphological analyzer, then assuming a uniform
distribution over the resulting emissions.
5 Experiments
5.1 Corpora
For evaluation purposes, we selected and morpho-
logically annotated (by hand) a small portion from
5We used The Uppsala Russian Corpus (1M tokens), which
is freely available from Uppsala University at http://www.
slaviska.uu.se/ryska/corpus.html.
the Russian translation of Orwell?s ?1984?. This cor-
pus contains 4011 tokens and 1858 types. For devel-
opment, we used another part of ?1984?. Since we
want to work with minimal language resources, the
development corpus is intentionally small ? 1788 to-
kens. We used it to test our hypotheses and tune the
parameters of our tools.
In the following sections, we discuss our experi-
ments and report the results. Note that we do not
report the results for tag position 13 and 14, since
these positions are unused; and therefore, always
trivially correct.
5.2 Morphological analysis
As can be seen from Table 4, morphological anal-
ysis without any filters gives good recall (although
on a non-fiction text it would probably be lower),
but also very high average ambiguity. Both fil-
ters (the longest-ending filter and automatically ac-
quired lexicon) reduce the ambiguity significantly;
the former producing a considerable drop of recall,
the latter retaining high recall. However, we do best
if we first attempt lexical lookup, then apply LEF
to the words not found. This keeps recall reason-
ably high at the same time as decreasing ambiguity.
As expected, performance increases with the size of
the unannotated Russian corpus used to generate the
lexicon. All subsequent experimental results were
obtained using this best filter combination, i.e., the
combination of the lexicon based on the 1Mword
corpus and LEF.

5.3 Tagging
Table 7 summarizes the results of our taggers on test
data. Our baseline is produced by the morphologi-
cal analyzer without any filters followed by a tagger
randomly selecting a tag among the tags offered by
the morphological analyzer. The direct-full tag col-
umn shows the result of the TNT tagger with transi-
tion probabilities obtained directly from the Czech
corpus and the emission symbols based on the mor-
phological analyzer with the best filters.
To further improve the results, we used two tech-
niques: (i) we modified the training corpus to re-
move some systematic differences between Czech
and Russian (5.4); (ii) we trained batteries of tag-
gers on subtags to address the data sparsity problem
(5.5 and 5.6).
5.4 Russification
We experimented with ?russified? models. We
trained the TnT tagger on the Czech corpus with
modifications that made the structure of training
data look more like Russian. For example, plural
adjectives and participles in Russian, unlike Czech,
do not distinguish gender.

?Gifted men/women were competing.?[Ru]
Negation in Czech is in the majority of cases is ex-
pressed by the prefix ne-, whereas in Russian it is
very common to see a separate particle (ne) instead:
(3) a. Nic
nothing
ner?ekl.
not-said
?He didn?t say anything.? [Cz]
b. On
he
nic?ego
nothing
ne
not
skazal.
said
?He didn?t say anything.? [Ru]
In addition, reflexive verbs in Czech are formed by a
verb followed by a reflexive clitic, whereas in Rus-
sian, the reflexivization is the affixation process:
(4) a. Filip
Filip
se
REFL-CL
jes?te?
still
nehol??.
not-shaves
?Filip doesn?t shave yet.? [Cz]
b. Filip
Filip
esc?e
still
ne
not
breet+sja.
shaves+REFL.SUFFIX
?Filip doesn?t shave yet.? [Ru]
Even though auxiliaries and the copula are the forms
of the same verb byt? ?to be?, both in Russian and in
Czech, the use of this verb is different in the two
languages. For example, Russian does not use an
auxiliary to form past tense:
(5) a. Ja?
I
jsem
aux1sg
psal.
wrote
?I was writing/I wrote.? [Cz]
b. Ja
I
pisal.
wrote
?I was writing/I wrote.? [Ru]
It also does not use the present tense copula, except
for emphasis; but it uses forms of the verb byt? in
some other constructions like past passive.
We implemented a number of simple ?russifica-
tions?. The combination of random omission of the
verb byt?, omission of the reflexive clitics, and nega-
tion transformation gave us the best results on the
development corpus. Their combination improves
the overall result from 68.0% to 69.4%. We admit
we expected a larger improvement.
5.5 Sub-taggers
One of the problems when tagging with a large
tagset is data sparsity; with 1000 tags there are
10003 potential trigrams. It is very unlikely that a
naturally occurring corpus will contain all the ac-
ceptable tag combinations with sufficient frequency
to reliably distinguish them from the unacceptable
combinations. However, not all morphological at-
tributes are useful for predicting the attributes of the
succeeding word (e.g., tense is not really useful for
case). We therefore tried to train the tagger on indi-
vidual components of the full tag, in the hope that
each sub-tagger would be able to learn what it needs
for prediction. This move has the additional bene-
fit of making the tag set of each such tagger smaller
and reducing data sparsity. We focused on the first 5
positions ? POS (P), SubPOS (S), gender (g), num-
ber (n), case (c) and person (p). The selection of
the slots is based on our linguistic intuition ? for
example it is reasonable to assume that the infor-
mation about part-of-speech and the agreement fea-
tures (gnc) of previous words should help in pre-
diction of the same slots of the current word; or
information about part-of-speech, case and person
should assist in determining person. On the other
hand, the combination of tense and case is prima fa-
cie unlikely to be much use for prediction. Indeed,
most of our expectations have been met. The perfor-
mance of some of the models on the development
corpus is summarized in Table 5. The bold num-
bers indicate that the tagger outperforms the full-tag
tagger. As can be seen, the taggers trained on indi-
vidual positions are worse than the full-tag tagger
on these positions. This proves that a smaller tagset
does not necessarily imply that tagging is easier ?
see (Elworthy, 1995) for more discussion of this in-
teresting relation. Similarly, there is no improve-
ment from the combination of unrelated slots ? case
and tense (ct) or gender and negation (ga). How-
ever, the combinations of (detailed) part-of-speech
with various agreement features (e.g., Snc) outper-
form the full-tag tagger on at least some of the slots.

5.6 Combining Sub-taggers
We now need to put the sub-tags back together to
produce estimates of the correct full tags. We can-
not simply combine the values offered by the best
taggers for each slot, because that could yield ille-
gal tags (e.g., nouns in past tense). Instead we select
the best tag from those offered by our morphologi-
cal analyzer using the following formula:
(6) bestTag = argmaxt?TMAval(t)
TMA ? the set of tags offered by MA
val(t) =?14k=0 Nk(t)/Nk
Nk(t) ? # of taggers voting for k-th slot of t
Nk ? the total # of taggers on slot k
That means, that the best tag is the tag that received
the highest average percentage of votes for each of
full-tag all best 1 best 3

better than the full-tag tagger. One (?all?) uses all
available subtaggers, other (?best 1?) uses the best
tagger for each slot (therefore voting in Formula 6
reduces to finding a closest legal tag). The best re-
sult is obtained by the third tagger (?best 3?) which
uses the three best taggers for each of the Pgcp slots
and the best tagger for the rest. We selected this tag-
ger to tag the test corpus, for which the results are
summarized in Table 7.

Table 8: Tagging with Xerox & our tagger
5.7 Comparison with Xerox tagger
A tagger for Russian is part of the Xerox language
tools. We could not perform a detailed evaluation
since the tool is not freely available. We used the
online demo version of Xerox?s Disambiguator6 to
tag a few sentences and compared the results with
the results of our tagger. The Xerox tagset is much
smaller than ours, it uses 63 tags, collapsing some
cases, not distinguishing gender, number, person,
tense etc. (However, it uses different tags for dif-
ferent punctuation, while we have one tag for all
punctuation). For the comparison, we translated our
tagset to theirs. On 201 tokens of the testing cor-
pus, the Xerox tagger achieved an accuracy of 82%,
while our tagger obtained 88%; i.e., a 33% reduc-
tion in error rate. A sample analysis is in Table 8.
5.8 Comparison with Czech taggers
The numbers we obtain are significantly worse than
the numbers reported for Czech (Hajic? et al, 2001)
(95.16% accuracy); however, they use an extensive
manually created morphological lexicon (200K+
entries) which gives 100.0% recall on their testing
data. Moreover, they train and test their taggers on
the same language.
6 Ongoing Research
We are currently working on improving both the
morphological analysis and tagging. We would like

competencies/content-analysis/demos/
russian
to improve the recall of filters following morpholog-
ical analysis, e.g., using n maximal values instead
of 1, using some basic knowledge of derivational
morphology, etc. We are incorporating phonological
conditions on stems into the guesser module as well
as trying to deal with different morphological phe-
nomena specific to Russian, e.g., verb reflexiviza-
tion. However, we try to stay language independent
(at least within Slavic languages) as much as possi-
ble and limit the language dependent components to
a minimum.
Currently, we are working on more sophisticated
russifications that would be still easily portable to
other languages. For example, instead of omitting
auxiliaries randomly, we want to use the syntac-
tic information present in Prague Dependency Tree-
bank to omit only the ?right? ones.
If possible, we would like to avoid entirely throw-
ing away the Czech emission probabilities, because
our intuition tells us that there are useful lexical
similarities between Russian and Czech, and that
some suitable process of cognate detection will al-
low us to transfer information from the Czech to
the Russian emission probabilities. Just as a knowl-
edge of English words is sometimes helpful (mod-
ulo sound changes) when reading German, a knowl-
edge of the Czech lexicon should be helpful (mod-
ulo character set issues) when reading Russian. We
are seeking the right way to operationalize this in-
tuition in our system, bearing in mind that we want
a sufficiently general algorithm to make the method
portable to other languages, for which we assume
we have neither the time nor the expertise to under-
take knowledge-intensive work. A potentially suit-
able cognate algorithm is described by (Kondrak,
2001).
Finally, we would like to extend our work to Slavic
languages for which there are even fewer available
resources than Russian, such as Belarusian, since
this was the original motivation for undertaking the
work in the first place.
