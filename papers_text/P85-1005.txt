It~r the ~,utomatic acquisition of taxonomic and ~dcntity

tzL,~onomic and identity information lior use by learning 
and reasoning programs in artificial intelligence. Such 
information can also find use in efforts to develop 
setectiun restrictions from Icxical sources. Of course,

steps. 
(1) The dcfiniteness of the noun phr,'kses is 
,ascertained by examining the determiners and 
several othcr parameters. The algorithm is 
summarized by figure 2. Another algorithm 
dcscrihed by Iigure 3 is used Ibr determinerless 
plural NPs. 
(2) The quantificational slatus of the subject and 
object is (Ictermined by I(~)king each case tip in 
the table depicted hy Iigt, re 4. Putentially 
ambiguous cases (marked with an ~tstcrisk) may 
require referencing the noun phrase in the 
semantic model to rcs~lve the ambiguity.

The addition of the cla~s cate~urization calls lbr the'class

The determiner. "no', is trevtcd as the negation 
of 'all.' Thus, the NP is quantified as a ckL~s and the 
copula negated. While SI0 and S18 in I\]gure 5 are valid, 
S19 is not. There are restrictions on where "no" can 
appear. It cannot modify b~)lh the subject ~md object.

S{~metimcs copular verbs take adjectives in the 
object position, leaving no apparent object. Some of 
these adjectives have a displaced ohjec/ as in $2, SI I, Sl3, 
.";15 and ~16 in ligure 5. Wcrc there actually no-bject, 
the qtmntil\]cation r  the subject w~tlhl bc determined in 
is~i'.'tiun (u.',ing a different algorithm). When the 
adjective has an ~bjcct. that object is u:;cd to perfimn the 
NP intcreonstraint with the subject. (Ja.,,cs C6 and C8 are 
imp~,,.,,ible ($22 and $24) unlcss the sentences have 
displact:d uhjccts (SI 1 and S13). tlowcvcr, this is not the 
cast: liar (26 where a copular verb is modal and has a 
partiuvc tletcrminer on its object. This suggests that 
pa~lilive readings of  class determiners may make tht~e 
cases acceptable and that displaced objects simply make 
such a reading easier.

Recent interest in developing lexicons to 
support computer understanding of natural language 
\[Walker and Amsler, 1985\] suggests die need for cfreetive 
methods of attgmcnting our Icxicographical knowledge 
using large corpora and unrestricted text. Selection 
restrictions are an important ype of information to 
accumulate because they are needed not only to 
distinguish different senses of words but also to recognize 
metaphorical uses. Since accumuhttion of selection 
rcstrictio,s rctluires it, acquisition or taxonomic 
ialb.'mation is a priority. The coptflar intcrconstnlint 
algorithm introduced in this paper provides a basis lbr 
acquiring large taxonomics from unrestricted texts. A 
filter can be used to quickly pmnc all non-copt.lar 
sentences :t~ well as (lilfictflt copular sentences involving 
hclicl: and perhaps, time contexts. The remaining 
scntc))ccs can be parsed, quantified and represented in a 
large semantic model. 
This research would not only advance our 
knowledge of natur'd laxonomics and selection 
rc.~tricti~)ns h,t it woultl also generate mpirical data 
tt:)clitl I~)r ttlose studying "dcfault logics' and stereotype 
hierarchies \[Minsky, 1975; Keil, 1979: Rotter, 1980; 
l-',rachrnan, 1982; Etherington and Rotter, 1983\]. One 
dil'l\]ct.ity with this research program is that an 
uncertainty principle is at work: The taxonomy used to 
determine selection restrictions itself depends on 
recognition of nlctaphors fllrottgh selection restrictions. 
Success in this lexicographical task will require the 
careful development of effective research strategies.
