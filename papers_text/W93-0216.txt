1 In t roduct ion  
Each utterance of a discourse ither bears a semantic relation to a preceding utterance, or constitutes 
the onset of a new semantic unit. Thus, a critical task in discourse understanding is determining how 
to relate each new utterance to the current representation f the discourse, Sequences of semantically 
related utterances are referred to as segrnents. The discourse intentions of the speaker provide one 
basis for determining which utterances belong within one segment \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\]. As 
discussed in \[Passonneau nd Litman, 1993\], we are conducting an empirical study of the relation 
between discourse segments and intentions. We have estabfished that naive subjects can reliably 
identify the same discourse segment boundaries, using a commonsense notion of speaker intention as 
the segmentation criterion. Briefly, Section 2 describes our study, and Section 3 presents our results 
that agreement among subjects on discourse segment boundaries is highly statistically significant. 
Taking these results as a starting point, we ask in Section 4 whether subjects also agree on the 
intentions they associate with segments. Exa.mination of our data suggests that subjects do agree on 
the semantic labels they associate with segments. In Section 5 we discuss the question of how relations 
among segments are recognized by looking at a class of cases in which ;m earlier suspended segment 
is resumed (i.e., discourse pops). We hypothesize that in spontaneous oral discourse, relations among 
segments are often not directly signaled, but must be inferred. 
2 The  Study  
Our corpus consists of 20 narrative monologues a,bout tile sa.lue movie (~bout 14,000 words total), 
taken from Chafe's "Pe;tr Stories" \[Chafe, 1980\]. Seven subjects I)er na.rrative were presented with 
a verl)a.tim transcript, 1 such that each line of the transcript corresponded to one prosodic phrase 
(sentence-final or phrase-final contour, see Chafe \[1980\] for details). Subjects were instructed to 
identify sequential chunks, 2 each representing a single intention. Subjects were also instructed to 
describe the speaker intention for each discourse segment. Intention was explained in common sense 
terms and by example. Subjects were restricted to placing boundaries between prosodic phrases. An 
excerpt from the instructions i shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 2 illustrates a portion of an intention-based segmentation produced by 7 subjects. Distinct 
subjects are indicated by letters of the alphM)et. Prosodic phrases are numbered sequentially; the

We have looked at a simpler linear intention-based segmentation task. Our pilot study a.~ well ms the work of Rotondo 
\[1984\] indicated that more COml)lex segmentation ta.sks were too cumbersome given our ;Lverage narrative l ngth. Hearst 
\[1993\] also examines linear segmentation, l)~ed on a notion of topic change.

3 Discourse Segment Boundaries 
In \[Passonneau and Litman, 1993\], we show that our subjects agree with one another at levels 
that are statistically significant, thus demonstrating the reliability of intention as a segmentation 
criterion. Percent agreement is defined in \[Gale et al, 1992\] as the ratio of observed agreements with 
the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion. We use percent agreement 
to measure the ability of subjects to agree with one anotlter on whether there is ~ segment boundary 
between two adjacent prosodic phrases. We find that the average agreement across the 20 narratives 
on the status of all potential boundary locations is 89% (with a range from 82%-92%). We then Use 
Cochran's test \[Cochran, 1950\] to deternfine if these levels of agreement are statistically significant. 
Cochran's test compares the observed number of subjects placing a boundary at every potential 
site with the number predicted by a random distribution; it is aSSulned that the total number of 
boundaries assigned by any one subject is given by that subject's actual pertbrmance. The greater 
the difference from randomness, the more unlikely is the observed istribution. For the 20 narratives, 
the probabilities of the observed boundary distributions ranged from p = .1 ? 10 -6 to p < .6 ? 10 -9, 
all very highly significant. 
We Mso show why we consider bound~tries agreed upon by a majority of subjects to be empirically 
validated. By partioning Cochran's tatistic, we find the threshold for significance across all subjects 
and all narratives to be when at least 4 of 7 subjects agree. Using this threshohl, we can derive a single 
61 
discourse segmentation for each narrative. For the excerpt in Figure 2, this gives two empirically 
validated boundaries, represented as ordered pairs of prosodic phrases: (14.1,14.2) and (15.4,16.1). 
4 Discourse Segment Intention 
The 5 prosodic phrases from 14.2 through 15.4 constitute a segment, which we represent as \[14.2,15.4\]. 
From Figure 2, we see that 5 different subjects i(lentified exactly this segment. Inspection of sub- 
jects' descriptions of speaker intention shows that in such cases of agreement on segments, subjects 
also generally agree on the narrator's intentions for the segment. Figure 3 presents the intentions 
attributed to the narrator by the 5 subjects for \[14.2,15.4\]. The 5 subjects who agreed on the seg- 
ment (n-e) all indicate that the speaker's intentions pertain to describing the audio characteristics 
of the movie. The other 2 subjects (f,g) included one or two preceding phrases in the segment (of. 
Figure 2). Subject f characterized the segment 1)urpose as techniques used in the movie, and thus 
identifies essentially the same intentional structure. Subject g, who began the segment with 13.1, 
characterized the intention as when the boy falls no one else cares about him. Subject g thus not 
only identifies a different segment boundary, but also a different overall purpose. 
Presumably, the 5 subjects depicted in Figure 3 abstract from the th.ct that the three full clauses 
in the segment all refer to auditory characteristics, as signaled by the lexical items conversation i  
the first clause, sounds in the second, and say in the third. Here we have generalized further from 
the subjects annotations to note that each asserts omething about the movie's auditory character. 
In general, for segments delimited by high agreement I)oundaries, a single formulation of speaker 
purl)ose can be generalized from the data provided by the 7 sul)jects. We believe that such data 
provides evidence that when asked to, subjects perform the same kinds of abstraction across related 
utterances described in \[Polanyi, 1988\] and elsewhere. 
5 Discourse Segment Pops 
In Figure 2, one of tile main characters of tile movie (a boy on a bicycle) is referred to in phrases 13.1 
and 14.1. The speaker suspends her description of the boy's activities throughout the next segment 
(\[14.2,15.4\]), but resumes reference to the boy in the first utterance of the following segment (16.1) 
using a third person definite pronoun subject (he). This illustrates a specific class of discourse pops, 
in which a segment resumes an earlier suspended segment. In particular, this class of resumption 
segments begins with an utterance in which a third person definite pronoun refers to an entity that is 
not in the focus space \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\] associated with the intervening segment. Processing 
a clause that signals this type of discourse pop involves several tasks. Resolving the prononn in the 
initial clause of the resumption seglnent requires shifting the attentional state \[Grosz and Sidner, 
1986\], since the active focus space (correspon(ling to the intervening segment) does not contain a 
representation of the referent. This shift depends on recognizing the termination of the intervening 
segment, and a continuation relation between the resulni)tion and suspended segments, so that the 
entities in focus in the suspended segment are again in focus for the resumption segment. 
There are 8 discourse pops of the type in Figure 2 in the 10 narratives that we have coded for 
referential relations (coding described in \[Passonneau, 1993\]). These 8 examples exhibit various 
structural and semantic relations to the presumed discourse mo(lel. For example, they contain 
intervening segments that provide more detail, provide general background, or are digressions. In 7 
cases, the resumption segment begins with a word that can flmction as a, cue word, 3 but in 4 cases 
the cue word is and, a word whose discom'se usage is hard to distinguish and which provides very 
:~We a.~sume that different uses of cue l)hra~es can be discriminated; cf. \[Hirschberg and Litman. 1993\]. 
62 
little semantic inforlnation. The cue words in the relnaining 3 cases are so, all right and then, none 
of which clearly signal attentional change \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993\]. 
Non-lexical signals (e.g., uh, tsk, false starts) precede the initial clause of the resumption segment 
in 5 cases, and relatively long pauses (> 1.5 see.) in 6 (cf. \[Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992\]). This 
suggests that in spontaneous oral discourse, instead of giving explicit indicators of the structural 
and semantic relations among segments, peakers provide non-lexical and pausal cues to breaks in 
segmental structure, relying on the hearer to infer the abstract structural and semantic relations. 
For example, the semantics of the I)l'edication fidl over at the onset of the resuml)tion segment is 
arguably very dissimilar to the predications occurring in the intervening seglnent, possibly supporting 
the inference that the new clause is unrelated to the intervening segrnent. In contrast, the two 
clauses which end the suspended segnlent (at 14.1) and begin the resulnption segment (at 16.11 
are semantically identical and structurally parallel, supporting the inference that 16.1 resuntes the 
segment containing 14.1. 
6 Conc lus ion  
Our study establishes that a naive notion of speaker intention serves as a reliM)le criterion for 
identifying discourse segments. Qualitative analysis of annotations of speaker intention supports 
the conclusion that where subjects agree on segment boundaries, they also agree on the segment's 
intention. Using the empirically validated seglnents, we can begin to ask specific questions about the 
relation between segments and their abstract representation in an evolving discourse model. We note 
that for spontaneous oral narrative, discourse pops 1nay not lie explicitly signaled by cue words, and 
that structural and semantic relations among distinct segnlents may instead require inference, ht 
\[Passonneau nd Litman, 1993\], we directly address how explicit devices such as pauses, cue words 
and referential noun phrases correlate with seglnental structure in order to posit constraints between 
surface structure choices and intentional and seglnental structure.
