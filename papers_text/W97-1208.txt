Abstract 
This paper describes an experimental 
method for detecting prosodic functions. 
We assume that the first step towards con- 
tent driven synthetic prosody generation 
(Concept-to-speech) is invariably to de- 
termine the perceptually relevant prosodic 
features. The proposed method has been 
applied to the detection of syntactic struc- 
ture: dialogue acts and given/new distinc- 
tion. First results are being discussed. 
1 Motivation 
Within the framework of Concept-to-speeclh our aim 
is to integrate additonal information such as struc- 
turing, focus: dialogue act: speaker attitude into the 
prosodic modelling of synthesized utterances. The 
first step into this direction is to find out which addi- 
tional information is reflected in the prosodic struc- 
ture. An investigation as to what information about 
the content of an utterance is actually encoded in 
the prosody and how this coding is realized by the 
natural speaker is inherently necessary \[Lib74\]. The 
aim for more natural prosody generation can only 
be determined by an adequate description of human 
prosody and its interaction with content informa- 
tion. In this paper we propose a method determin- 
ing which linguistic concepts have a functional in- 
fluence on prosody. Prosody is known to be of a 
very complex nature, yet we cannot per se suggest 
that every communicative function is relevantly en- 
coded it, in. At least we have to distinguish between 
functions that necessarily pertain to the prosodic 
structure: and those that are not identifiably located 
within prosody. Once the relevant concepts have 
been found: their influence on the acoustic parame- 
ters related to prosody can be investigated. 
2 Methodological description 
2.1 Idea 
Prosodic function has been discussed frequently, e.g. 
\[Bar81,Leo70,Koh87\]. One major problem is the 
separation of prosodic and segmental influences. In 
applications with no control over spectral qualities: 
such as time-domain concatenative synthesis sys- 
tems, only prosodic parameters can be modified to 
convey linguistic concepts. To qualify and quantify 
the information contained in the prosody~ we use 
specially designed perception tests. The segmen- 
tal information in the stimuli is removed: in order 
to make sure that all information is carried by the 
prosody alone. 
2.2 Choice  of  st imul i  
Many previous experiments on prosody have been 
forced to employ ambiguous test sentences or words 
which is clearly suboptimal. With our method the 
semantic ontent of the stimuli becomes irrelevant to 
the test results and the optimal stimuli for a given 
task can be used. Also, the stinmli can be extracted 
from a read text or from a natural dialogue situation: 
as long as the quality of the recording is not too 
degraded. 
2.3 Stimuli manipulation 
A stimulus is constructed on the basis of the points 
of glottal excitation (pitchmarks) of the original sig- 
nal while preserving the energy. The manipulated 
stinmli contain only prosodic information: F0 con- 
tour, temporal structure and energy distribution. 
Thus, they reflect exactly the parameters that can 
be varied using PSOLA \[Mou90\]. Different stimulus 
manipulation methods have been compared in the 
validation test series (3). 
2.4 Test  p rocedure  
Depending on the aim of the investigation: the ma- 
nipulated stimuli are presented either with or with- 
57 
out the original sentence in writing.` and either with 
or without visual representation. The proposed 
method is not tied to a specific test setting. Various 
examples of successful test procedures are reported 
in this paper, and more settings can easily be de- 
veloped. The questions the subject has to answer 
can be very simple, aimed directly at the linguistic 
function in question. There is no need to instruct 
the subject to listen only to the prosody.` as he/she 
will hear nothing else. 
2.5 Resu l ts  
The reliability of the test results does not depend 
on the listener's ability to concentrate solely on the 
prosody as is the case when evaluating original utter- 
antes; nonsense sentences or utterances consisting of 
nonsense words. The results can be based on a large 
number of stimuli rather than be restricted to the 
particularities of only a few, because there are no 
semantical l imitations to generating more stimuli. 
3 Va l idat ion  tes t  ser ies  
Several methods for speech delexicalisation can be 
found in the l iterature \[Kre82.`Pas93.`Leh79,Mer96, 
Oha79:Pij94;Sch84\]. The aim of all these manipula- 
tions is to render the lexical content of an utterance 
unintelligibl% while leaving the speech melody and 
temporal structure intact. We think that the ideal 
stimulus manipulation for prosodic perception tests 
should meet three main requirements: 
? it should clearly convey the primary prosodic 
functions (i.e. accentuation, phrasing and sen- 
tence modality~ 
? the detection of these phenomena should not 
require too much listening effort from the test 
subject 
? the manipulation procedure should be simple 
and quick 
We compared six methods of delexicalisation ac- 
cording to these criteria. Subjects had to complete 
four different asks. They were questioned after each 
task which of the six different stimulus versions they 
found easiest for the task, most difficult for the task. 
most pleasant and least pleasant. Learning effects 
are negligible because the presentation order was 
changed for each subject. 
3.1 St imul i  man ipu la t ion  
All the stimuli referred to in this paper were digitally 
recorded in an anechoic chamber with 16kHz and 
16bit. The following sex manipulation methods were 
compared:

The extracted pitchmarks of the original signal 
were filled with an excitation signal proposed by 
the CC ITT  \[CIT89\], and also low-pass filtered. 
The original signal was low-pass filtered using a 
time variant filter with a cut-off frequency just 
above F0. At unvoiced segments within the sig- 
nal the cut-off frequency was automatically set 
to zero. 
A combination of spectral inversion and filtering 
proposed by \[Kre82\]. After high-pass filtering 
at 600Hz, the signal is spectrally inverted.` then 
low-pass filtered at 4000Hz and then added to 
the residual of the original signal low-pass fil- 
tered at 200Hz. The resulting signal preserves 
the voiced / unvoiced distinction and is the 
most intelligible of the versions compared. 
The extracted pitchmarks of the original sig- 
nal were filled with the Liljencrants-Fant model 
\[Fan85\] of glottal flow. 
A simple sawtooth signal was inserted into the 
extracted pitchlnarks. 
The pitchmarks were filled with a sinus with a 
first harmonic of 1/4 of the amplitude and a 
second harmonic of 1/16 of the amplitude. 
Other ways of rendering an utterance unintelligi- 
ble, such as \[Pij94,Pag96\], were not included as we 
tried to keep the effort for stimuli manipulation as 
low as possible. 
3.2 Count ing  of  sy l lables 
In the first test session 18 subjects were asked to 
count the number of syllables of 12 short sentences 
aurally presented in the different manipulated ver- 
sions. The stinmli were chosen out of five different 
sentences (5-8 syllables of length) spoken by a fealale 
speaker and manipulated with the six different pro- 
cedures described above. Out of these stimuli two 
sentences per version were used for syllable counting 
while the rest was used for the accent assigmnent 
task. As this was an open response task, there is no 
referential chance level as in the other tests. The re- 
suits show that the syllable number of nearly 60% of 
all stimuli can be determined exactly with the pro- 
posed method, at least at sentence level (Pig. 1). 
In 86% of all cases, the correct number of syllables 
plus/minus one were detected. 
3.3 Phrase  accent  ass ignment

tences (six versions in three different sentences) to

assign a phrase accent to a syllable. Again presen- 
tation order differed from subject to subject. Now~ 
they could see a cursor moving along an oscillogram 
of the current phrase; where each syllable bound- 
ary was marked. This combination of aural and vi- 
sual presentation was chosen to make sure that the 
subjects: ability to count syllables was not tested 
again. To avoid any influences of the visual am- 
plitude differences between the syllables on the sub- 
ject:s choice: the stinmli had been adjusted to have a 
more or less equal energy distribution over the whole 
phrase. We thus reduced the intonational informa- 
tion by the energy factor. The results appear to con- 
firm that this is the least important factor \[Fry58\] 
within prosodic perception. In 73.4% of all cases the 
phrase accent was correctly assigned (Fig. 2). Some 
of the subjects reported that the possibility of relat- 
ing the perceived accent to a visual cursor position 
helped a lot. Others, who seemed to have no prob- 
lems with the syllable counting task; said that they 
were rather confused by the visualization.

16 subjects were presented with three phrases

three different modalities: terminal, progredient (i.e.

subject hstened to 32 stimuli chosen randomly from 
these nine phrases manipulated by the six proce- 
dures and decided on one of the given modalities. 
The result was highly significant: 84% of the stimuli 
were correctly recognized (Fig. 3).

3.5 Phrase  boundary  detect ion  
12 subjects were asked to place two phrase bound- 
aries in 20 manipulated stimuh with the additional 
help of visual presentation. Four different sentences 
(12-20 syllables) had been read by a female speaker; 
all containing two syntactically motivated prosodic 
boundaries. The visual signal contained markers at 
each visible syllable boundary which served as possi- 
ble phrase boundary location. As there were 15 pos- 
sible boundaries per sentence in the mean, chance 
level can be calculated as being around 6.6%. All 
stimuli were checked whether they contained a visu- 
ally obvious pause at the boundaries. These pauses 
were manually eliminated. Even though this meant 
that the most important clue for boundary detec- 
tion \[Leh79\] was eliminated the subjects managed a
significantly correct detection in 66.6% of all stimuli 
(Fig. 4). One of the two boundaries was correctly 
placed in 90% of the cases. 
3.6 Choice of  s t imulus  man ipu la t ion  
All four tasks yielded correct results. It was sur- 
prising that the error rate for the differently ma- 
nipulated stimuli did not significantly differ, nei- 
ther within a task nor over all. So the decision 
which manipulation procedure to prefer can only be

based upon the subjective valuation of the pleasant- 
ness. As the differences between the tasks are small 
enough, we compare the subjects' opininions over 
all tasks (Fig. 5). The least "easy" version was the 
one filtered at the fundamental frequency. The sinu- 
soidal signal and the signal after the Liljencrants- 
Fant model were "not difficult". "Most comfort- 
able" was the CCITT excitation signal, the signal 
filtered at F0 and the sinoidal signal. The spec- 
trally inverted signal and the sawtooth excitation 
signal were judged "least comfortable". All these 
differences were significant (p<0.05). All in all we 
conclude that the sinoidal signal is the most appro- 
priate one (Fig. 6). Our findings confirmed the re- 
suits about the pleasantness of manipulated signals 
in \[Kla97\].

4 Examples of tests carried out to 
detect prosodic concepts 
The first two tests described here (emotions and syn- 
tactic structure) took place before the comparison 
of stimulus manipulation methods. Therefore they 
have been carried out using the sawtooth excitation 
signal. In the latter two tests (dialogue acts and 
given/new), the sinusoidal signal manipulation de- 
scribed in 2.3 was used. 
4.1 Emot ions  
In a test aimed at identifying the emotional con- 
tent (e.g. fear, joy, anger, disgust, sadness) from the 
prosodic properties only, speech signals that were 
resynthesized with a concatenative system yielded 
the same poor results as the delexicalized stimuli 
\[Heu96\]. Both stimuli gave results that were at 
chance level. It is obvious that in this case, where the 
naturalness of an utterance depends on features that 
are not readily controllable by time-domain synthe- 
sis system (e.g. aspiration, creaky voice etc.) a 
test procedure with resynthesized speech will not 
improve the results that have been obtained with 
the delexicalized stimuli, because all the parameters 
that are used for the resynthesis are present in the 
delexicalized stimuli. 
4.2 Syntact i c  s t ruc ture  
To show that prosody transports information about 
the syntactic structure of a sentence, subjects were 
asked to assign one of several given syntactic struc- 
tures to the presented elexicalized stimuli \[Son96b\]. 
The possible syntactic structures were represented 
by written sentences, one of which had the same 
syntactic structure as the stimulus. These sentences 
differed from the utterances that served as the source 
for the test stimuli (see Fig. 7). Asked to pick

out the sentence they were hearing, the subjects be- 
lieved that what they heard was the written sen- 
tence, which shows that their decision was based 
solely on prosody. Stimuli of one male speaker were 
correctly classified in 80~ of all cases. A profes- 
sional male speaker with very elaborate speaking 
style yielded 67~) of correct answers. 
4.3 Dia logue  acts  
The motivation for this test was to decide whether 
different dialogue act types have a perceivable in- 
fluence on the prosodic structure of an utterance. 
Within the VERBMOBIL  project, dialogue act 
types from the domain of appointment scheduling di- 
alogues are used \[Rei95\]. If these dialogue act types 
have specific prosodic forms, then the synthesis mod- 
ule should generate them accordingly. 
For a first approach we chose to evaluate the four 
dialogue act types: 
? affirmation 
? negation 
? suggestion 
? request 
For each dialogue act type: eight sentence's were 
read by a male and a female speaker. For affir- 
mation and negation~ only statements were chosen 
(length: 1-10 syllables), and four questions and four 
answers for suggestion and request (length: 6-14 syl- 
lables). The resulting 64 sentences were manipu- 
lated and randomly presented to ten subjects who 
had to assign one of the four dialogue act types to 
each sentence. Although each subject remarked that 
this was a pretty difficult task, their answers were 
significantly (p<0.001) above chance level (Fig. 8). 
What  seemed more difficult than relating the utter- 
ance to an abstract internal reference was the fact 
that the two speakers' utterances were presented in 
random order. They differed remarkably not only as 
to their fundamental frequency but also to their ex- 
pressive strategies. Whereas the male speaker was 
more often thought to sound negating, the female 
speaker was mostly recognized as being requestive. 
Also, dialogue acts spoken by the female speaker 
were recognized significantly better as those spoken 
by the male. This indicates the degree to which 
the interpretation of a linguistic concept depends on 
the speaker's personality and should be taken into 
account whenever speaker adaptation of the syn- 
thetic output is desired. Perception tests should 
always take into account the subjects' comments 
on the completed task. This can yield very useful 
but often neglected extra information. The subject 
(no. 10 in Fig. 9) who scored better than the oth- 
ers explained his strategy. To distinguish between 
affirmation/negation the one hand and sugges- 
tion/request on the other, he assumed that in the 
former, the focused part of the utterance lies at the 
very beginning of the utterance, whereas in the lat- 
ter, the second half of the utterance should bear 
more focus. Whether this assumption can be gener- 
alized or not has to be investigated in further per- 
ception tests.

4.4 Given/new 
As an extension of the phrase accent assignment test 
we tested the accuracy with which subjects perceive 
differently focussed parts within a delexicalized ut- 
terance. The stimuli consisted of eight sentences 
of a new/given structure and eight sentences of a 
given/new structure of different length. They were 
read by a female and a male speaker as possible an- 
swers to a question, then manipulated and presented 
in random order. The 'given' part was always a 
rephrasing of a part of the question. Ten subjects 
were given a short explanatory text with an example 
and then asked to decide in which order the different

task was supported by an oscillogram of the stimu- 
lus containing four marks as possible boundary lo- 
cations. As in Section 3.3.` the energy distribution 
over the whole sentence was smoothed. Some sub- 
jects claimed that the location task was easier than 
the order recognition task. The order recognition 
task was correctly completed in 78%, the boundary 
was correctly located in 62% (Fig. 10). Both tasks 
were significantly (p<0.001) completed over chance 
level, yet some inter-subject differences were also sig- 
nificant. The subjects located the 'new I part sig- 
nificantly (p<0.002) more often at the beginning of 
the sentence, which can be explained by intonational 
downstep.

5 Conc lus ion  
We have shown that the proposed nlethod stands 
up to the three requirements. It significantly con- 
veys prosodic functions and no segmental informa- 
tion.` a reasonably pleasant signal manipulation was 
found and the manipulation is easy, so that most 
preparatory effort can go into the choice of stimuli 
and the test design. The test design is variable and 
can be adequately set for the phenomenon under in- 
vestigation. The problem of localizing a certain part 
of an utterance has been tackled by visual presen- 
tation. The visual presentation should still be im- 
proved so that it does not show pauses or energy 
distribution. The mixture of different voices within 
one test seems to degrade the results. It is desirable 
to check the findings with more different voices. A 
separate test run for each voice should faciliate the 
task as it enables the subject to get used to the in- 
dividual speaker properties. 
Some of the subjects.` side comments have allowed 
an interesting insight into their listening strategies. 
We think that the proposed method is an efficient 
link between linguistic theory and practical appli- 
cation. On the one hand theoretical assumptions 
within Concept-to-speech have to be validated in an 
actual application. On the other hand perception 
tests of the kind we have described them can lead to 
new theoretical findings. 
The method is being applied to detect prosodic on- 
tent information in dialogue situations of the do- 
mains appointment scheduling; hotel reservation and 
tourist information within the German VERBMO- 
BIL project. Once more reliable information about 
what can be perceived from the prosody has been 
collectedl the interplay of the correlating acoustic 
parameters will be investigated. Finally the findings 
will be implemented and evaluated again.
