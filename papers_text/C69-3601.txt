THE LEXICON: A SYSTEM OF MATRICES OF LEXICAL UNITS AND

Uriel  Weinre ich  /I/~ in d iscuss ing the fact that at one 
time many Amer ican scholars rel ied on either the disc ip l ine 
of psychology or  socio logy for the resolut ion of semantic 
problems~ comments:  
In Soviet lexicology, it seems, neither the tra- 
d i t ional is ts~ who have been content to work with 
the categor ies of c lassical  rhetor ic  and 19th- 
century histor ical  semantics~ nor the cr i t ical  
lex ico log ists  in search of better conceptual  tools, 
have ever found reason to doubt that l inguist ics 
alone is centra l ly  responsible for the investiga-

This paper deals with a cer ta in  conceptual  tool, the matrix, 
which l inguists  can use for organiz ing a lexicon to insure 
that words will be descr ibed (coded) with consistency,  that 
is~ to insure that quest ions which have been asked about 
cer ta in  words wil l  be asked for all words in the same class, 
regardless of the fact that they may be more di f f icult  to 
answer for some than for others. The paper wil l  also d i s -  
cuss cer ta in  new categories~ beyond those of c lass ical  
rhetoric~ which have been introduced into lexicology. 
i. INTRODUCTION 
The research in automatic t rans lat ion brought about by 
the int roduct ion of computers into the technology has 
~The research descr ibed herein has b&en supported by the In- 
format ion Systems Branch of the Off ice of Naval Research. 
The present work is an ampl i f icat ion of a paper~ "The Lexicon: 
A Matr i~ of Le~emes and Their  Propert ies"~ contr ibuted to the 
Conference  on Mathemat ica l  L inguist ics at Budapest -Balatonsza-

engendered a change in l inguist ic thinking, techniques, and " 
output .  The  essence  o f  th i s  change i s  that  vague genera l -  
izations cast into such phrases as 'words which have this 
general meaning are often encountered in these and similar 
structures' have been replaced by the precise def in i t ion of 
rules and the enumerat ion of complete sets of words def ined 
by a given property. Whereas once  it was acceptable to say 
(e.g., about Russian) that 'certain short forms which are 
modals tend to govern a UTO6~ clause', now it is required 
that: (a) the term 'modal' be defined, either bY cr i ter ia  
so precise that any modal could be easi ly identif ied, or if 
that is not possible, by a list conta in ing all of the modals 
of the language, and (b) the 'certain short forms which are 
modals' which actually do govern a UTOOM clause be l ikewise 
identif ied, either by precise criteria, or by a list. 
Linguist ic research into Russian has led to and will 
cont inue to yield many discover ies about the language, and 
the problem of recording and recal l ing the content of these 
discoveries is not trivial. A system is required to 
organize the information which has been ascertained, so 
that this information can be convenient ly  retr ieved when 
it is required; such a system is real ized as a lexicon. 
F i l lmore /3/  has def ined a lexicon as follows: 
I conceive of a lexicon as a list of minimal ly  
redundant descr ipt ions of the syntactic, semantic, 
and phonological  propert ies of lexical items, 
accompanied by a system ot redundancy rules, the 
latter conceivable as a set Of instruct ions on 
how to interpret the lexical entries.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE LEXICON 
The steps in the construct ion  of a lexicon may be de- 
tai led as follows: 
a) decid ing which words to enter, i.e., the lexical stock 
b) dec id ing what are the subsets of the le?ical stock 
c) decid ing what informat ion to code about each subset 
d) compi l ing  the informat ion 
e) structur ing the storage of the information 
where the steps out l ined have interdependencies.  We shall 
d iscuss each of the steps, especia l ly  in re lat ion to the 
Russ ian  language. 
a) The Lexical Stock 
Ideal ly a Russian lexicon should conta in all of the words 
in the Russ ian language, but 'all Russ ian words' is a set 
whose contents are not universal ly  agreed upon, since some 
words are gradual ly dropped from usage, while others are 
cont inual ly  being formed and added to the lexical stock. The 
words to be entered in the lexicon could  be obtained from 
ex is t ing sources, i .e. ,  lexicons and technical  d ict ionar ies,  
and be supplemented by neologisms found in wr i t ten works. 
The lex icographer  must also be alert for new meanings and 
contexts  in which 'old' words may appear. 
b) Subsets of the Lexical Stock 
The lexical stock of Russ ian may be subdiv ided into word 
classes, i.e., words having certa in  propert ies in common. 
These propert ies may be morpholog ica l  and/or functional.  In 
Russian~ nouns are not marked for tense and predicat ives 
-3-  
are not marked for the property of animateness; hence they 
are in di f ferent word classes. The subsets may coincide 
with those of tradit ional gram_mar, or they may be di f ferent  
if the grammar to which the lexicographer refers is not the 
tradit ional one. 
c) Information to be Coded 
The choice of information to be coded in a part icular 
lexicon is a function of its intended use-- in other words, 
one should code the information that will be necessary for a 
part icular purpose or set of purposes, or information that 
has a forseeable application. For example, one of the tasks 
for the Wayne State Univers i ty  Machine Trans lat ion group was 
to program a routine to group each nominal in a Russ ian sen- 
tence with its preceding (dependent) modif iers. This pro- 
cedure, cal led blocking, requires that the computer -stored 
lexicon conta in I) word class information for ident i fy ing 
nominals and modif iers, as well as conjunct ions,  punctuation, 
and adverbs intervening between the modif iers, and other 
word classes, tokens of which mark the boundar ies of a 
block; and 2) case, number, and gender information for esta- 
b l ishing an agreement relat ion between the nominal and the 
preceding modif iers. 
Most exist ing Russian lexicons conta in  the usual morpho- 
logical information for members of inf lected word classes: 
person, gender, number, case, animation, paradigm, aspect, 
etc.. Cer ta in  syntactic informat ion such as impersonal i ty  
-4- 
and government of cases, preposit ions,  the infinit ive, and 
clauses, is indicated for verbal word classes. This indica- 
t ion may be expl ic i t  or sometimes only impl ic it  in an ex- 
ample; it is not consistent.  It is not unusual to chance 
upon one of the complements  of a cer ta in  predicat ive under 
the entry head of another predicat ive for which the example 
is given. In the Academy of Sciences d ict ionary /4/, the 
entry head ~eaenm~ contains the example CTaao BApyF 06~AHO 
M AocaAHO,  qTO HpMxoAMTCH MFpaT~ TaKy~ He~eny~ pooh.  In  the  
same lexicon~ under OOMAH~,  the form OOMBHO is shown to  
govern a qTO clause in an example; however, under AocaAa 
there is neither coding nor example to indicate that ~ocanHo 
takes a qTO clause. 
Each lexical entry should include all of the ex ist ing 
phonological ,  morphologica l ,  and syntact ic  in format ion about 
the head word; the d iscuss ion  and presentat ion  of this in- 
format ion will entai l  the in t roduct ion  of concepts  from 
semantics and styl ist ics. When using a Russ ian lexicon, one 
should be able to d iscover whether ~OmHO is a modal (if the 
grammar of Russ ian uses the concept 'modal' for the word 
class of which MO~HO is a member) by looking under the entry 
head MOXHO and f inding the pos i t ion where the property 'modal' 
is coded for that word. Furthermore,  one should be able to 
determine whether MOXHO takes an inf in i t ive complement,  
i 
whether if takes a subject, or whether if has a corresponding 
long form, etc.. 
S ince the predicate is the sentence fulcrum, i.e., since 
-5- 
it contains the most information necessary for analysis of 
the structure of the sentence, the coding of the complements 
of predicat ive words is one of the main tasks for the data  
input to automatic parsing of Russian sentences. Machine 
translat ion oriented lexicographers have done a great deal 
of work in coding the complements of many lexemes, especia l ly  
the predicatives, in an expl ic i t  and thorough way. 
lordanskaja /5/ suggested 126 di f ferent complementat ion  
patterns to account for the "strong government"  of 7000 
Russian stems. She recognized that the meanings of the stems 
could be associated with di f ferent patterns; e.g., exe~oBaTb 
has the fol lowing meanings with the fol lowing complements:  
i) 'to go after' with 3a + instr. 
2) 'to ensue' with H3 + gen. 
3) 'to be guided by something' with dative without prep. 
She recommended that the stems with di f ferent meanings be 
treated as different, and that a model be composed separately 
for each item. 
Rakhmankulova /6/ has written 12 models of complements 
for sentences containing any of ten dif ferent German verbs 
denoting pos i t ion in space, and she i l lustrates, in a 
matrix, which verbs can appear in which models. 
Machine translat ion groups have examined Russ ian texts 
and from them compi led l ists of nominals and predicat ives 
which take an inf init ive complement or a ~TO or qTOdH clause 
complement~ and lists, of governing modif iers with their 
-6- 
complementary  structures~ many of which are not shown in 
any lexicon. The Wayne State Univers i ty  group has done 
extens ive coding of the complementat ion  of predicat ives 
(verbs and short form modif iers) ,  modi f iers  (part ic iples 
and adject ives which govern complementary  structures),  
and nouns. The group has created an auxi l iary d ic t ionary  
which is structured so that every complementat ion  pattern 
(where the pattern includes an indicat ion of the opt ional  
presence or ob l igatory  absence of a subject) associated 
with each predicat ive in the d ict ionary is wr i t ten out ex- 
pl icit ly.  For example, the entry for noTpe0OBaTB in this 
auxi l iary d ict ionary reads as follows: 
CAN SUBJECT 
PATTERN (NOM. CASE) 
NUMBER BE PRESENT? 
yes 
yes

O+gen

yes  
For t rans lat ion purposes, it wil l  be necessary to indicate 
the t rans lat ion(s)  of the predicat iv~ cor respond ing  to each 
pattern, as wel l  as those of the prepos i t ions and case 
endings in each pattern. A language example of pat tern  3 
-7- 
is Yxe oKo~o HO~y~HS eFo HoTpe6oBa~M K OKO~OTOqHO~o -'AI- 
ready around midday they summoned him %0 the police.', 
whi le pattern 4 is i l lustrated by OT ~McaTeaH M~ noTpe~yeM 
Y.y~oxecTBeHHOR npaB~.  -'Of a writer we shall 
art ist ic truth.' 
The above entry may not be complete. For instance, i% 
does not show the entry y+gen which ref lects  a phrase in 
Smi rn i t sky ' s  d ict ionary /7/, Tpe6oBaT5 O6%SCHeHMS y KOF0 -- 'to 
demand an explanat ion from somebody', which is not shown in 
three Russ ian lexicons /8/. Furthermore, i% can be seen 
that the patterns with K+da% can be extended so that that 
phrase is replaced by B+aCC or even by an adverbial  ~OMOR 
-'home'. New information will always be added. 
One transformational ist  technique is to specify a syn- 
tactic construct ion along with a list of (all of the) lexemes 
which can occur in a certa in posi t ion of that construct ion.  
The set of lexemes which Can be tokens in a certa in pos i t ion 
of a construct ion is the domain of that const ruct ion  with 
respect to the position. Once a. lexeme is in that domains- 
the pair cons ist ing of the posit ion and the const ruc t ion  
becomes par% of the def in i t ion of that lexeme. The lexeme 
is complete ly  def ined by all of the pairs in which it is a 
token, and ideal ly the contents of a lexical entry would in- 
c lude all such pairs. 
F i l lmore /9/ has compi led a list of Engl ish verbs which 
take a to-phrase complement, i.e. le~emes which occur in the 
-8- 
pos i t ion  VERB of the const ruct ion  SUBJ  + VERB + to-phrase. 
He is careful  to point out that the to-phrase must funct ion 
as the complement of the verbs on the list (e.g., agree, 
endeavor,  hope, want) and not as a purposive adverbial phrase 
(as with. 'wait '  in 'He waited to see her.' where 'to' can 
be replaced by 'in order to'), since as he states,"The 
appearance of purpose adverbial  to-phrases.. ,  does not 
appear to be statable in terms of contextual  verb type."/10/ 
Th is  indicates that the formal construct ion is not always 
suf f ic ient  to def ine a property, and that the deep structure 
funct ion of the const ruct ion  may have to be specif ied as 
well. 
The fact that statements which are formally identical  
can have dist inct deep structures is i l lustrated by the 
fo l lowing Russ ian language examples, which are not only 
formal ly identical,  but identical  in content except for one 
word: 
N~TB qe~oBe~ 6H~o BH0paHo HaMM. 
Five persons were elected by us. 
N~TB qeaoBe~ 6~o B~OpaHo ~eaeFaTaMM. 
Five persons were e lected as de legates /by the delegates. 
BSTB qe~oBeE 6N~o BH6paHo pe~epeH~yMoM. 
Five persons were elected by referendum. 
In the f irst example, the (pro)noun in the instrumental  
case is the subject of the active transform 
i 
MM BHOpaaM HHTB qeaoBeK. 
We e lected five persons. 
whi le in the second example, f irst interpretat ion,  the in- 
-9 -  
strumental  noun remains in the instrumental  case in the 
active transform, where (X) stands for some subject: 
(X) B~paaM n~T~ qea0BeK ~eaeFaTa~M. 
(X) elected five people as delegates. 
The instrumental  noun in the third sentence also remains in 
the instrumental  case in the active transform, but is shown 
to have a di f ferent funct ion from the noun in the second 
sentence by the fact that it i s  possible, albeit not ele- 
gant, to say 
NHT5 ueaoBeE ONao BNOpaHo ~eaeraTaMM peCepeH~yMoM. 
Five people were elected as delegates by referendum. 
and correspondingly  
(X) BH~paaM nSTb qeaoBeK ~eaeFaTaMM pe~epeH~yMOM." 
(X) elected five people as delegates by referendum.,  
i.e. both words can coexist  in a sentence. 
Kiefer /i\]/ has shown for Hungar ian that the meaning of 
the verb can change within a given const ruct ion  when the 
def in i t ion of the construct ion is formal and does not con- 
sider semantic propert ies of the components.

where the animate status of the subject d is t ingu ishes  the 
possess ive and locational meanings. 
Lehiste /12/ has shown that the d is t inct ion  between 
'being' and 'having' in Estonian is one of d i f ferent  comple-  
ments taken, under special  condit ions,  by the same verb.

are structurally identical, since morphologically isal and 
laual are both in the adessive case and raamat is in the 
nominative case, when functional (semantic) case names 
are used, isal is dative and laual is locative, while 
raama___.___~t is in both sentences in the objective case. 
As researchers work in the area of discovering and 
codifying syntactic properties, they find out that semantic 
considerations are impossible to avoid. Much of the new 
work in lexieology involves the analysis of predicates and 
their arguments (i.e., subjects, and complements such as 
clauses, noun/adjective phrases, and prepositional phrases). 
The transition from purely syntactic coding (i.e., specifying 
the complements and their morphological cases if applicable) 
to semantic coding has been made by Fillmore /13/ with his 
grammatical cases (e.g., agent, instrument, object). 
d) Compil ing the Information 
Compil ing a dictionary entails discovering facts about 
a language and arranging these facts in such a way that they 
may be conveniently retrieved. The ,key factor is that once 
a statement is made about a certain member of a word Class, 
all the other menbers of that class must be coded for the 
way that statement applies to them. If the statement is 
"% 
-ii- 
? 
i r relevant for certa in members, it may be desirable to  create 
a new word class for the latter. 
A lexicon without lacunae can be compi led by the fo l lowing 
procedure: For each word class construct  a matrix such that 
each co lumn head is a bit of informat ion pert inent to this 
class, and the row heads are all of the words in this class. 
Each intersect ion must be f i l led with some code indicat ing 
whether or not the word has the property, and the codes of 
the  proper t ies  must be such that  they  a l low the  ent i re  spec-  
t rma of  poss ib le  answers.  For example ,  s ince  the  Russ ian  
CHpoxa - 'orphan' - can be feminine or mascul ine,  the gender 
code  must  inc lude  a l so  combinat ions  o f  the  bas ic  components  
(mascu l ine ,  femin ine ,  and neuter ) ;  s ince  the  Russ ian  
~Hdx~epe~HposaTb --' to  d i f fe rent ia te '  - i s  both  per fec t ive  
and imper fec t ive ,  the  code fo r  aspect  must compr i se  ent r ies  
fo r  'per fec t ive ' ,  ' imper fec t ive ' ,  and 'both ' .  When a verb  
i s  marked 'both ' ,  i t  may be des i rab le  to  spec i fy  the  d i s -  
t r ibut ion  o f  the aspects  over  meaning and/or  tenses .  
This matr ix format forces the lexicographer to commit 
himself  about the way each property appl ies to each member 
of the word class. It precludes the o ld- fash ioned quasi-  
coding, where the lexicographer coded what he knew and 
omitted what he did not know or had never thought to con- 
sider. In some Russ ian lexicons, certa in nouns were coded for 
having no plural, but the absence of this coding in other 
entr ies did not necessar i ly  imply that they did have a 
-12- 
plural;  the only inference that could be drawn was that 
most nouns not coded for having no plural did indeed have 
one, but this in format ion is not meaningful  when def in i te 
in format ion about a part icu lar  entry is required. 
When using the matr ix format, with its demands for con- 
sistency, one faces the problem of how to get the informat ion 
to fi l l  its intersect ions.  Natural ly,  if the informat ion 
is a lready in a dict ionary,  or if the lex icographer  has an 
example, from some text, of the phenomenon to be coded, there 
is no problem in f i l l ing the intersect ion. However, if the 
example is lacking, this is not always suff ic ient ground for 
cod ing the non-ex is tence of the proper ty .  Sometimes~ de- 
spite the absence of an example, the lex icographer  feels that 
the property  holds, and he may consult  with a native informant, 
us ing the caut ion of fered by Zel l ig  Harr is  /14/: 
If the l inguist  has in his corpus ax, bx, but 
not cx (where a, b, c are e lements with general 
d is t r ibut iona l  s imilar ity)9 he may wish to check 
with the informant as to whether cx occurs at all. 
The e l ic i t ing  of forms from an informant has to 
be planned with care because of suggest ib i l i ty  
in certa in  interpersonal  and intercultural  re- 
lat ions and because it may not always be possible 
for the informant to say whether a form which 
is proposed by the l inguist occurs in his language. 
Rather than const ruct ing  a form cx and asking 
the informant 'Do you say cx?' or the like, the 
l inguist  can in most cases ask quest ions which 
should lead the informant to use cx if the form 
occurs in the informant 's  speech. At its most 
innocent, e l ic i t ing  consists  of dev is ing situa- 
t ions in which the form in quest ion  is l ikely 
to occur in the informant 's  speech. 
Work  at Wayne State Univers i ty  on the complementat ion  
of cer ta in  Russ ian -o forms by qTO/qTOO~ c lauses /15/ sup- 
-13- 
ports Harris' observation. The di f f icul t ies of working w i th  
a native informant became evident when, on dif ferent occasions 
the native accepted and then rejected certain constructions. 
Sometimes the acceptance depended on the construct ion of 
contexts which eluded the native on the second perusal. 
The matrix approach is currently being used in Russian 
lexicon research at Wayne State University, Where the inform- 
ation in the Academy dict ionary /16/ and in Ushakov /17/ 
is being coded. ~ The omissions and inconsistencies of 
presenting lexical information in the lexicons are discussed 
in a paper by Alexander Vitek /18/. Grammatical  prof i les 
have been produced for all Russian substantives, adjectives, 
and verbs, including their der ivat ive part ic iples and 
gerunds. The profi les contain primari ly morphological  
properties, but some syntactic coding, mainly of comple- 
mentat ion patterns, has also been started. 
A sample of the coding format developed for Russian verbs 
(in Ushakov) in this research appears in Figures 1 and 2. 
In Figure I, the coding form for Russian verb morpho- 
logy, separate fields are denoted by a single slash mark. 
Each field has codes for certain morphological  propert ies 
of the Russian verb. The fol lowing chart explains the codes 
for the verb ~OOHT~ - 'to obtain', which appears on the first 
line of Figure i.

e) Structur ing the Storage of the Information 
There are many ways of stor ing the words of a language. 
With respect to sequencing, a lphabet ical  order is the most 
popular method, although reverse d ict ionar ies  exist, and 
d ict ionar ies where words are sequenced by their length and 
only alphabetized within a given word length, or where word 
class is the primary division, are conceivable.  With respect 
to the entry heads, they can be stems, canonical  forms, or 
all of the forms that exist in the language. Note that a 
canonical  form could be a part icular  form of a paradigm 
such as the mascul ine singular form of an adject ive or the 
inf in i t ive form of a verb, or it could be a certa in  verb 
from which other verbs are der ived by certa in  rules. B innick 
/19/ has i l lustrated the latter by suggest ing that be could 
be an entry head having, as part of its contents, ~ and 
-18- 
make which are the causat ive forms of the locational and 
ex istent ia l  meanings, respectively,  of be. F i l lmore /20/ 
has ment ioned that str ike and touch di f fer  pr imari ly  only 
in re lat ive intensi ty of impact. It is interest ing to 
note that Hebrew has for some verbs a basic form which is 
Con jugated through seven 'constructions',  two of which are 
labeled 'causative' and ' intensive'. 
A lex icon whose entry  heads are stems or canonical  
forms has the advantage of compactness and the advantage 
that the whole paradigm associated with these forms is in- 
I 
dicated. It has the d isadvantage that the user must know 
the rules of der ivat ion in order to look up words which are 
not in canonical  form. If every form in the language is an 
entry  head, then the lexicon is much longer, but the homo- 
graphic propert ies  of the word are convenient ly  recorded; 
one might never realize, using a canonical  for lexicon, that 
cea is both the past tense of OeCT~ - 'to sit down' - and 
the genit ive plural  of ce~o - 'village' -~ but this property 
would be immediate ly  evident if tea were an entry head. 
In the Wayne State  Univers i ty  machine translat ion re- 
search, Russ ian text to be translated or analyzed is 'read 
in' one sentence at a time; start ing from left to right, 
segments of the sentence are ' looked up' in order to obta in 
whatever  in format ion about them has been stdred in the machine 
t rans lat ion  lexicon. The min imum segment is one word; the 
maximum segment is an ent i re sentence~ no segment is fermi- 
-19- 
nated inside a ~ord. The entry heads of the lexicon were 
des igned to correspond to the segments, and therefore are 
~rds  or sequences of words (idioms). The entry heads could 
be canonical  forms or stems, but this would require automatic 
procedures for t ransforming any inf lected form into its 
canonical  form, and for f inding the stem of any form in text. 
Space can be saved in a full form lexicon by enter ing only 
once~ perhaps under the canonical  form, the informat ion 
which all members of a paradigm share 9 and cross referencing 
this informat ion under the related entry heads. In the 
Wayne State Univers i ty  machine translat ion research~ sets 
of complementat ion patterns are stored in an auxi l iary 
d ict ionary and any set can be referenced by any verbal form. 
The sequence of entry heads in the lexicon is alphabetical ,  
since the shape of the text word to be looked up is its only 
identi f icat ion.  Natural ly,  if the set of Russ ian words could 
be put into a one-to-one correspondence with some subset of 
the posit ive integers by a funct ion whose value on any word 
in its domain could be determined only by informat ion de- 
ducib le from the graphemic structure of that word~ then the 
entry heads of the lexicon would not have to be in alphabetic 
i 
order; in this case, the lookup would be simpler and faster, 
s ince the entr ies could be randomly accessed. 
The number of columns in the matr ix of any word class 
should be without limit so that new informat ion can be en- 
tered. Similar ly,  the number of rows should be without 
-20- 
l imit to al low addit ions as the lexical stock of the lan- 
guage grows.
