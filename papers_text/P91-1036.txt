In previous papers we presented methods for 
retrieving collocations from large samples of 
texts. We described a tool, X t rac t ,  that im- 
plements these methods and able to retrieve 
a wide range of collocations in a two stage 
process. These methods a.s well as other re- 
lated methods however have some limitations. 
Mainly, the produced collocations do not in- 
clude any kind of functional information and 
many of them are invalid. In this paper we 
introduce methods that address these issues. 
These methods are implemented in an added 
third stage to Xt ract  that examines the set of 
collocations retrieved uring the previous two 
stages to both filter out a number of invalid col- 
locations and add useful syntactic information 
to the retained ones. By combining parsing and 
statistical techniques the addition of this third 
stage has raised the overall precision level of 
X t rac t  from 40% to 80% With a precision of 
94%. In the paper we describe the methods 
and the evaluation experiments. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In the past, several approaches have been proposed to 
retrieve various types of collocations from the analysis 
of large samples of textual data. Pairwise associations 
(bigrams or 2-grams) (e.g., \[Smadja, 1988\], \[Church and 
Hanks, 1989\]) as well as n-word (n > 2) associations 
(or n-grams) (e.g., \[Choueka el al., 1983\], \[Smadja nd 
McKeown, 1990\]) were retrieved. These techniques auto- 
matically produced large numbers of collocations along 
with statistical figures intended to reflect heir relevance. 
However, none of these techniques provides functional in- 
formation along with the collocation. Also, the results 
produced often contained improper word associations re- 
flecting some spurious aspect of the training corpus that 
did not stand for true collocations. This paper addresses 
these two problems. 
Previous papers (e.g., \[Smadja nd McKeown, 
1990\]) introduced a.set of tecl)niques and a. tool, Xt ract ,  
that produces various types of collocations from a two- 
stage statistical analysis of large textual corpora briefly 
sketched in the next section. In Sections 3 and 4, we 
show how robust parsing technology can be used to both 
filter out a number of invalid collocations as well as add 
useful syntactic information to the retained ones. This 
filter/analyzer is implemented in a third stage of Xtract 
that automatically goes over a the output collocations to 
reject the invalid ones and label the valid ones with syn- 
tactic information. For example, if the first two stages 
of Xtract produce the collocation "make-decision," the 
goal of this third stage'is to identify it as a verb-object 
collocation. If no such syntactic relation is observed, 
then the collocation is rejected. In Section 5 we present 
an evaluation of Xtract as a collocation retrieval sys- 
tem. The addition of the third stage of Xtract has been 
evaluated to raise the precision of X t rac t  from 40% to 
80?? and it has a recall of 94%. In this paper we use ex- 
amples related to the word "takeover" from a 10 million 
word corpus containing stock market reports originating 
from the Associated Press newswire. 
2 F IRST 2 STAGES OF XTRACT,  
PRODUCING N-GRAMS 
In af i rst  stage, X t rac t  uses statistical techniques to 
retrieve pairs of words (or bigrams) whose common ap-  
pearances within a single sentence are correlated in the 
corpus. A bigram is retrieved if its frequency of occur- 
rence is above a certain threshold and if the words are 
used in relatively rigid ways. Some bigrams produced 
by the first stage of X t rac t  are given in Table 1: the 
bigrams all contain the word "takeover" and an adjec- 
tive. In the table, the distance parameter indicates the 
usual distance between the two words. For example, 
distance = 1 indicates that the two words are fre- 
quently adjacent in the corpus. 
In a second stage, X t rac t  uses the output bi- 
grams to produce collocations involving more than two 
words (or n-grams). It examines all the sentences con- 
taining the bigram and analyzes the statistical distri- 
bution of words and parts of speech for each position 
around the pair. It retains words (or parts of speech) oc- 
cupying a position with probability greater than a given 
279 
threshold. For example, the bigram "average-industrial" 
produces the n-gram "the Dow Jones industrial average" 
since the words are always used within this compound 
in the training corpus. Example. outputs of the second 
stage of X t raet  are given in Figure 1. In the figure, the 
numbers on the left indicate the frequency of the n-grams 
in the corpus, NN indicates that. a noun is expected at 
this position, AT indicates that an article is expected, 
NP stands for a proper noun and VBD stands for a verb 
in the past tense. See \[Smadja nd McKeown, 1990\] and 
\[Smadja, 1991\] for more details on these two stages.

3 STAGE THREE:  SYNTACTICALLY  
LABEL ING COLLOCATIONS 
In the past, Debili \[Debili, 1982\] parsed corpora of French 
texts to identify non-ambiguous predicate argument rela- 
tions. He then used these relations for disambiguation in 
parsing. Since then, the advent of robust parsers uch as 
Cass \[Abney, 1990\], F idd i teh \[Itindle, 1983\] has made it 
possible to process large amounts of text with good per- 
formance. This enabled Itindle and Rooth \[Hindle and 
Rooth, 1990\], to improve Debili's work by using bigram 
statistics to enhance the task of prepositional phrase at- 
tachment. Combining statistical and parsing methods 
has also been done by Church and his colleagues. In 
\[Church et al, 1989\] and \[Church'et ai., 1991\] they con- 
sider predicate argument relations in the form of ques- 
tions such as What does a boat typically do? They are 
preprocessing a corpus with the F idd l teh parser in order 
to statistically analyze the distribution of the predicates 
used with a given argument such as "boat." 
Our goal is different, since we analyze a set of 
collocations automatically produced by Xt rac t  to either 
enrich them with syntactic information or reject them. 
For example, i f ,  bigram collocation produced by Xt rac t  
involves a noun and a verb, the role of Stage 3 of X t rac t  
is to determine whether it is a subject-verb or a verb- 
object collocation. If no such relation can be identified, 
then the collocation is rejected. This section presents 
the algorithm for X t rac t  Stage 3 in some detail. For 
illustrative purposes we use the example words takeover 
and thwart with a distance of 2. 
3.1 DESCRIPT ION OF THE ALGORITHM 
Input :  A bigram with some distance information in- 
dicating the most probable distance between the two 
words. For example, takeover and thwart with a distance 
of 2. 
Output /Goah Either a syntactic label for the bigram 
or a rejection. In the case of takeover and thwart the 
collocation is accepted and its produced label is VO for 
verb-object. 
The algorithm works in the following 3 steps: 
3.1.1 Step 1: PRODUCE TAGGED 
CONCORDANCES 
All the sentences in the corpus that contain the 
two words in this given position are produced. This 
is done with a concord,acing program which is part of 
X t raet  (see \[Smadja, 1991\]). The sentences are labeled 
with part of speech information by preprocessing the cor- 
pus with an automatic stochastic tagger. 1
3.1.2 Step 2: PARSE THE SENTENCES 
Each sentence is then processed by Cass, a 
bottom-up incremental parser \[Abney, 1990\]. 2 Cass 
takes input sentences labeled with part of speech and 
attempts to identify syntactic structure. One of Cass 
modules identifies predicate argument relations. We use 
this module to produce binary syntactic relations (or la- 
bels) such as "verb-object" (VO), %erb-subject" (VS), 
"noun-adjective" (N J), and "noun-noun" ( N N ). Con- 
sider Sentence (1) below and all the labels as produced 
by Cass on it. 
(1) "Under the recapitalization plan it proposed to 
thwar t  the takeover . "  
label bigrarn 
SV it proposed 
NN recapitalization plan 
VO thwart takeover 
For each sentence in the concordance set, from 
the output of Cass, X t rac t  determines the syntactic 
relation of the two words among VO, SV, N J, NN and 
assigns this label to the sentence. If no such relation is 
observed, X t rac t  associates the label U (for undefined) 
to the sentence. We note label\[ia~ the label associated 
1For this, we use the part of speech tagger described in 
\[Church, 1988\]. This program was developed at Bell Labora- 
tories by Ken Church.

Research by Steve Abney, Cass stands for Cascaded Analysis 
of Syntactic Structure. I am much grateful to Steve Abney 
to help us use and customize Cass for this work.

EVALUATION 
3.1.3 S tep  3: RE JECT OR LABEL  
COLLOCATION 
This last step consists o f  deciding on a label for 
the bigram from the set of label\[i~'.s. For this, we count 
the frequency of each label for the bigram and perform 
a statistical analysis of this distribution. A collocation 
is accepted if the two seed words are consistently used 
with the same syntactic relation. More precisely, the 
collocation is accepted if and only if there is a label 12 ~: 
U satisfying the following inequation: 
\[probability(labeliid \] = ?)> T I 
in which T is a given threshold to be determined 
by the experimenter. A collocation is thus rejected if no 
valid label satisfies the inequation or if U satisfies it. 
Figure 2 lists some accepted collocations in the 
format produced by Xt ract  with their syntactic labels. 
For these examples, the threshold T was set to 80%. 
For each collocation, the first line is the output of the 
first stage of X t rac t .  It is the seed bigram with the 
distance between the two words. The second line is the 
output of the second stage of X t rac t ,  it is a multiple 
word collocation (or n-gram). The numbers on the left 
indicate the frequency of occurrence of the n-gram in 
the corpus. The third line indicates the syntactic label 
as determined by the third stage of X t rac t .  Finally, 
the last lines simply list an example sentence and the 
position of the collocation in the sentence. 
Such collocations can then be used for vari- 
ous purposes including lexicography, spelling correction, 
speech recognition and language generation. Ill \[Smadja 
and McKeown, 1990\] and \[Smadja, 1991\] we describe 
how they are used to build a lexicon for language gener- 
ation in the domain of stock market reports. 
The third stage of X t rac t  can thus be considered as a 
retrieval system which retrieves valid collocations from 
a set of candidates. This section describes an evaluation 
experiment of the third stage of X t rac t  as a retrieval 
system. Evaluation of retrieval systems is usually done 
with the help of two parameters: precision and recall 
\[Salton, 1989\]. Precision of a retrieval system is defined 
as the ratio of retrieved valid elements divided by the 
total number of retrieved elements \[Salton, 1989\]. It 
measures the quality of the retrieved material.  Recall 
is defined as the ratio of retrieved valid elements divided 
by the total number of valid elements. It measures the 
effectiveness of the system. This section presents an eval- 
uation of the retrieval performance of the third stage of 
X t rac t .  
4.1 THE EVALUATION EXPERIMENT 
Deciding whether a given word combination is a 
valid or invahd collocation is actually a difficult task 
that is best done by a lexicographer. Jeffery Triggs is 
a lexicographer working for Oxford English Dictionary 
(OED) coordinating the North American Readers pro- 
gram of OED at Bell Communication Research. Jef- 
fery Triggs agreed to manually go over several thousands 
collocations, a 
We randomly selected a subset of about 4,000 
collocations that contained the information compiled by 
Xt ract  after the first 2 stages. This data  set was then 
the subject of the following experiment. 
We gave the 4,000 collocations to evaluate to the 
lexicographer, asking him to select the ones that he

ness helped me understand some of the difficulty of lexicog- 
raphy. Without him this evaluation would not have been 
possible.

would consider for a domain specific dictionary and to 
cross out the others. The lexicographer came up with 
three simple tags, YY,  Y and N. Both Y and YY  are 
good collocations, and N are bad collocations. The dif- 
ference between YY  and Y is that Y collocations are of 
better quality than YY  collocations. YY  collocations 
are often too specific to be included in a dictionary, or 
some words are missing, etc. After Stage 2, about 20% 
of the collocations are Y, about 20% are YY, and about 
60% are N. This told us that the precision of X t rac t  at 
Stage 2 was only about 40 %. 
Although this would seem like a poor precision, 
one should compare it with the much lower rates cur- 
rently in practice in lexicography. For the OED, for 
example, the first stage roughly consists of reading nu- 
merous documents to identify new or interesting expres- 
sions. This task is performed by professional readers. 
For the OED, the readers for the American program 
alone produce some 10,000 expressions a month. These 
lists are then sent off to the dictionary and go through 
several rounds of careful analysis before actually being 
submitted to the dictionary. The ratio of proposed can- 
didates to good candidates i  usually low. For example, 
out of the 10,000 expressions proposed each month, less 
than 400 are serious candidate for the OED, which rep- 
resents a current rate of 4%. Automatically producing 
lists of candidate xpressions could actually be of great 
help to lexicographers and even a precision of 40% would 
be helpful. Such lexicographic tools could, for example, 
help readers retrieve sublanguage specific expressions by 
providing them with lists of candidate collocations. The 
lexicographer then manually examines the list to remove 
the irrelevant data. Even low precision is useful for 
lexicographers as manual filtering is much faster than 
manual scanning of the documents \[Marcus, 1990\]. Such 
techniques are not able to replace readers though, as they 
are not designed to identify low frequency expressions, 
whereas a human reader immediately identifies interest- 
ing expressions with as few as one occurrence. 
The second stage of this experiment was to use 
Xt rac t  Stage 3 to filter out and label the sample set of 
collocations. As described in Section 3, there are several 
valid labels (VO, VS, NN, etc.). In this experiment, we 
grouped them under a single label: T. There is only one 
non-valid label: U (for unlabeled}. A T collocation is 
thus accepted by Xt rac t  Stage 3, and a U collocation is 
rejected. The results of the use of Stage 3 on the sample 
set of collocations are similar to the manual evaluation 
in terms of numbers: about 40% of the collocations were 
labeled (T) by Xt rac t  Stage 3, and about 60% were 
rejected (U). 
Figure 3 shows the overlap of the classifications 
made by Xt rac t  and the lexicographer. In the figure, 
the first diagram on the left represents the breakdown in 
T and U of each of the manual categories (Y - YY and 
N). The diagram on the right represents the breakdown 
in Y - YY and N of the the T and U categories. For 
example, the first column of the diagram on the left rep- 
resents the application of X t rac t  Stage 3 on the YY col- 
locations. It shows that 94% of the collocations accepted 
by the lexicographer were also accepted by Xt ract .  In 
other words, this means that the recall ofthe third stage 
of X t rac t  is 94%. The first column of the diagram on the 
right represents the lexicographic evaluation of the collo- 
cations automatically accepted by Xt ract .  It shows that 
about 80% of the T collocations were accepted by the 
lexicographer and that about 20% were rejected. This 
shows that precision was raised from 40% to 80% with 
the addition of X t rac t  Stage 3. In summary, these ex- 
periments allowed us to evaluate Stage 3 as a retrieval 
system. The results are: 
I Prec is ion = 80% Recal l  = 94% \] 
5 SUMMARY AND 
CONTRIBUT IONS 
In this paper, we described a new set of techniques for 
syntactically filtering and labeling collocations. Using 
such techniques for post processing the set of colloca- 
tions produced by Xt rac t  has two major results. First, 
it adds syntax to the collocations which is necessary for 
computational use. Second, it provides considerable im- 
provement to the quality of the retrieved collocations as 
the precision of X t rac t  is raised from 40% to 80% with 
a recall of 94%. 
By combining statistical techniques with a sophis- 
ticated robust parser we have been able to design and 
implement some original techniques for the automatic 
extraction of collocations. Results so far are very en- 
couraging and they indicate that more efforts should be 
made at combining statistical techniques with more sym- 
bolic ones.
