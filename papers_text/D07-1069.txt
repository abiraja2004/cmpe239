Abstract
We introduce a technique for identifying the
most salient participants in a discussion. Our
method, MavenRank is based on lexical cen-
trality: a random walk is performed on a
graph in which each node is a participant in
the discussion and an edge links two partici-
pants who use similar rhetoric. As a test, we
used MavenRank to identify the most influ-
ential members of the US Senate using data
from the US Congressional Record and used
committee ranking to evaluate the output.
Our results show that MavenRank scores are
largely driven by committee status in most
topics, but can capture speaker centrality in
topics where speeches are used to indicate
ideological position instead of influence leg-
islation.
1 Introduction
In a conversation or debate between a group of
people, we can think of two remarks as interact-
ing if they are both comments on the same topic.
For example, if one speaker says ?taxes should
be lowered to help business,? while another argues
?taxes should be raised to support our schools,? the
speeches are interacting with each other by describ-
ing the same issue. In a debate with many people
arguing about many different things, we could imag-
ine a large network of speeches interacting with each
other in the same way. If we associate each speech
in the network with its speaker, we can try to iden-
tify the most important people in the debate based
on how central their speeches are in the network.
To describe this type of centrality, we borrow a
term from The Tipping Point (Gladwell, 2002), in
which Gladwell describes a certain type of person-
ality in a social network called a maven. A maven
is a trusted expert in a specific field who influences
other people by passing information and advice. In
this paper, our goal is to identify authoritative speak-
ers who control the spread of ideas within a topic. To
do this, we introduce MavenRank, which measures
the centrality of speeches as nodes in the type of net-
work described in the previous paragraph.
Significant research has been done in the area
of identifying central nodes in a network. Vari-
ous methods exist for measuring centrality, includ-
ing degree centrality, closeness, betweenness (Free-
man, 1977; Newman, 2003), and eigenvector cen-
trality. Eigenvector centrality in particular has
been successfully applied to many different types
of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin
and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical net-
works (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Ta-
rau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and
Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al,
2004). The authors of (Lin and Kan, 2007) extended
these methods to include timestamped graphs where
nodes are added over time and applied it to multi-
document summarization. In (Tong and Faloutsos,
2006), the authors use random walks on a graph as
a method for finding a subgraph that best connects
some or all of a set of query nodes. In our paper,
we introduce a new application of eigenvector cen-
trality for identifying the central speakers in the type
of debate or conversation network described above.
Our method is based on the one described in (Erkan
658
and Radev, 2004) and (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004),
but modified to rank speakers instead of documents
or sentences.
In our paper, we apply our method to analyze the
US Congressional Record, which is a verbatim tran-
script of speeches given in the United States House
of Representatives and Senate. The Record is a
dense corpus of speeches made by a large number
of people over a long period of time. Using the tran-
scripts of political speeches adds an extra layer of
meaning onto the measure of speaker centrality. The
centrality of speakers in Congress can be thought of
as a measure of relative importance or influence in
the US legislative process. We can also use speaker
centrality to analyze committee membership: are the
central speakers on a given issue ranking members
of a related committee? Is there a type of impor-
tance captured through speaker centrality that isn?t
obvious in the natural committee rankings?
There has been growing interest in using tech-
niques from natural language processing in the area
of political science. In (Porter et al, 2005) the
authors performed a network analysis of members
and committees of the US House of Representatives.
They found connections between certain commit-
tees and political positions that suggest that com-
mittee membership is not determined at random.
In (Thomas et al, 2006), the authors use the tran-
scripts of debates from the US Congress to auto-
matically classify speeches as supporting or oppos-
ing a given topic by taking advantage of the vot-
ing records of the speakers. In (Wang et al, 2005),
the authors use a generative model to simultane-
ously discover groups of voters and topics using
the voting records and the text from bills of the
US Senate and the United Nations. The authors
of (Quinn et al, 2006) introduce a multinomial mix-
ture model to perform unsupervised clustering of
Congressional speech documents into topically re-
lated categories. We rely on the output of this model
to cluster the speeches from the Record in order to
compare speaker rankings within a topic to related
committees.
We take advantage of the natural measures of
prestige in Senate committees and use them as a
standard for comparison with MavenRank. Our hy-
pothesis is that MavenRank centrality will capture
the importance of speakers based on the natural
committee rankings and seniority. We can test this
claim by clustering speeches into topics and then
mapping the topics to related committees. If the hy-
pothesis is correct, then the speaker centrality should
be correlated with the natural committee rankings.
There have been other attempts to link floor par-
ticipation with topics in political science. In (Hall,
1996), the author found that serving on a commit-
tee can positively predict participation in Congress,
but that seniority was not a good predictor. His
measure only looked at six bills in three commit-
tees, so his method is by far not as comprehensive
as the one that we present here. Our approach with
MavenRank differs from previous work by provid-
ing a large scale analysis of speaker centrality and
bringing natural language processing techniques to
the realm of political science.
2 Data
2.1 The US Congressional Speech Corpus
The text used in the experiments is from the United
States Congressional Speech corpus (Monroe et
al., 2006), which is an XML formatted version of
the electronic United States Congressional Record
from the Library of Congress1. The Congressional
Record is a verbatim transcript of the speeches made
in the US House of Representatives and Senate be-
ginning with the 101st Congress in 1998 and in-
cludes tens of thousands of speeches per year. In
our experiments we focused on the records from the
105th and 106th Senates. The basic unit of the US
Congressional Speech corpus is a record, which cor-
responds to a single subsection of the print version
of the Congressional Record and may contain zero
or more speakers. Each paragraph of text within
a record is tagged as either speech or non-speech
and each paragraph of speech text is tagged with the
unique id of the speaker. Figure 1 shows an example
record file for the sixth record on July 14th, 1997 in
the 105th Senate.
In our experiments we use a smaller unit of anal-
ysis called a speech document by taking all of the
text of a speaker within a single record. The cap-
italization and punctuation is then removed from
the text as in (Monroe et al, 2006) and then the
1http://thomas.loc.gov
659
text stemmed using Porter?s Snowball II stemmer2.
Figure 1 shows an example speech document for
speaker 15703 (Herb Kohl of Wisconsin) that has
been generated from the record in Figure 1.
In addition to speech documents, we also use
speaker documents. A speaker document is the
concatenation of all of a speaker?s speech docu-
ments within a single session and topic (so a sin-
gle speaker may have multiple speaker documents
across topics). For example within the 105th Senate
in topic 1 (?Judicial Nominations?), Senator Kohl
has four speech documents, so the speaker document
attributed to him within this session and topic would
be the text of these four documents treated as a sin-
gle unit. The order of the concatenation does not
matter since we will look at it as a vector of weighted
term frequencies (see Section 3.2).
2.2 Topic Clusters
We used the direct output of the 42-topic model of
the 105th-108th Senates from (Quinn et al, 2006)
to further divide the speech documents into topic
clusters. In their paper, they use a model where the
probabilities of a document belonging to a certain
topic varies smoothly over time and the words within
a given document have exactly the same probabil-
ity of being drawn from a particular topic. These
two properties make the model different than stan-
dard mixture models (McLachlan and Peel, 2000)
and the latent Dirichlet alocation model of (Blei et
al., 2003). The model of (Quinn et al, 2006) is most
closely related to the model of (Blei and Lafferty,
2006), who present a generalization of the model
used by (Quinn et al, 2006). Table 1 lists the 42
topics and their related committees.
The output from the topic model is a D ? 42 ma-
trix Z where D is the number of speech documents
and the element zdk represents the probability of the
dth speech document being generated by topic k.
We clustered the speech documents by assigning a
speech document d to the kth cluster where
k = argmax
j
zdj .
If the maximum value is not unique, we arbitrarily
assign d to the lowest numbered cluster where zdj is
2http://snowball.tartarus.org/
algorithms/english/stemmer.html
a maximum. A typical topic cluster contains several
hundred speech documents, while some of the larger
topic clusters contain several thousand.
2.3 Committee Membership Information
The committee membership information that we
used in the experiments is from Stewart and
Woon?s committee assignment codebook (Stewart
and Woon, 2005). This provided us with a roster
for each committee and rank and seniority informa-
tion for each member. In our experiments we use
the rank within party and committee seniority mem-
ber attributes to test the output of our pipeline. The
rank within party attribute orders the members of a
committee based on the Resolution that appointed
the members with the highest ranking members hav-
ing the lowest number. The chair and ranking mem-
bers always receive a rank of 1 within their party. A
committee member?s committee seniority attribute
corresponds to the number of years that the member
has served on the given committee.
2.4 Mapping Topics to Committees
In order to test our hypothesis that lexical centrality
is correlated with the natural committee rankings,
we needed a map from topics to related commit-
tees. We based our mapping on Senate Rule XXV,3
which defines the committees, and the descriptions
on committee home pages. Table 1 shows the map,
where a topic?s related committees are listed in ital-
ics below the topic name. Because we are matching
short topic names to the complex descriptions given
by Rule XXV, the topic-committee map is not one
to one or even particularly well defined: some top-
ics are mapped to multiple committees, some top-
ics are not mapped to any committees, and two dif-
ferent topics may be mapped to the same commit-
tee. This is not a major problem because even if a
one to one map between topics and committees ex-
isted, speakers from outside a topic?s related com-
mittee are free to participate in the topic simply by
giving a speech. Therefore there is no way to rank
all speakers in a topic using committee information.
To test our hypotheses, we focused our attention on
topics that have at least one related committee. In
Section 4.3 we describe how the MavenRank scores

3 MavenRank and Lexical Similarity
The following sections describe MavenRank, a mea-
sure of speaker centrality, and tf-idf cosine similar-
ity, which is used to measure the lexical similarity of
speeches.
3.1 MavenRank
MavenRank is a graph-based method for finding
speaker centrality. It is similar to the methods
in (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005), which can be used
for ranking sentences in extractive summaries and
documents in an information retrieval system. Given
a collection of speeches s1, . . . , sN and a measure
of lexical similarity between pairs sim(si, sj) ? 0,
a similarity graph can be constructed. The nodes
of the graph represent the speeches and a weighted
similarity edge is placed between pairs that exceed
a similarity threshold smin. MavenRank is based on
the premise that important speakers will have cen-
tral speeches in the graph, and that central speeches
should be similar to other central speeches. A recur-
sive explanation of this concept is that the score of
a speech should be proportional to the scores of its
similar neighbors.
Given a speech s in the graph, we can express the
recursive definition of its score p(s) as
p(s) =
?
t?adj[s]
p(t)
wdeg(t)
(1)
where adj[s] is the set of all speeches adjacent to
s and wdeg(t) =
?
u?adj[t] sim(t, u), the weighted
degree of t. Equation (1) captures the idea that the
MavenRank score of a speech is distributed to its
neighbors. We can rewrite this using matrix notation
as
p = pB (2)
where p = (p(s1), p(s2), . . . , p(sN )) and the ma-
trixB is the row normalized similarity matrix of the
graph
B(i, j) =
S(i, j)
?
k S(i, k)
(3)
where S(i, j) = sim(si, sj). Equation (2) shows
that the vector of MavenRank scores p is the left
eigenvector of B with eigenvalue 1.
We can prove that the eigenvector p exists by us-
ing a techinque from (Page et al, 1999). We can
treat the matrix B as a Markov chain describing
the transition probabilities of a random walk on the
speech similarity graph. The vector p then repre-
sents the stationary distribution of the random walk.
It is possible that some parts of the graph are dis-
connected or that the walk gets trapped in a com-
ponent. These problems are solved by reserving
a small escape probability at each node that repre-
sents a chance of jumping to any node in the graph,
making the Markov chain irreducible and aperiodic,
which guarantees the existence of the eigenvector.
Assuming a uniform escape probability for each
node on the graph, we can rewrite Equation (2) as
p = p[dU+ (1? d)B] (4)
where U is a square matrix with U(i, j) = 1/N
for all i and j, N is the number of nodes, and
d is the escape probability chosen in the interval
[0.1, 0.2] (Brin and Page, 1998). Equation (4) is
known as PageRank (Page et al, 1999) and is used
for determining prestige on the web in the Google
search engine.
3.2 Lexical Similarity
In our experiments, we used tf-idf cosine similarity
to measure lexical similarity between speech docu-
ments. We represent each speech document as a vec-
tor of term frequencies (or tf), which are weighted
according to the relative importance of the given
term in the cluster. The terms are weighted by their
inverse document frequency or idf. The idf of a term
w is given by (Sparck-Jones, 1972)
idf(w) = log
(
N
nw
)
(5)
where N is the number of documents in the corpus
and nw is the number of documents in the corpus
containing the term w. It follows that very common
words like ?of? or ?the? have a very low idf, while
the idf values of rare words are higher. In our experi-
ments, we calculated the idf values for each topic us-
ing all speech documents across sessions within the

given topic. We calculated topic-specific idf values
because some words may be relatively unimportant
in one topic, but important in another. For example,
in topic 22 (?Abortion?), the idf of the term ?abort?
is near 0.20, while in topic 38 (?Taxes?), its idf is
near 7.18.
The tf-idf cosine similarity measure
tf-idf-cosine(u, v) is defined as
P
w?u,v tfu(w) tfv(w) idf(w)
2
?P
w?u(tfu(w) idf(w))
2
?P
w?v(tfv(w) idf(w))
2
, (6)
which is the cosine of the angle between the tf-idf
vectors.
There are other alternatives to tf-idf cosine sim-
ilarity. Some other possible similarity measures
are document edit distance, the language models
from (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation proba-
bilities from (Erkan, 2006). For simplicity, we only
used tf-idf similarities in our experiments, but any of
these measures could be used in this case.
4 Experiments and Results
4.1 Data
We used the topic clusters from the 105th Senate
as training data to adjust the parameter smin and
observe trends in the data. We did not run experi-
ments to test the effect of different values of smin on
MavenRank scores, but our chosen value of 0.25 has
shown to give acceptable results in similar experi-
ments (Erkan and Radev, 2004). We used the topic
clusters from the 106th Senate as test data. For the
speech document networks, there was an average of
351 nodes (speech documents) and 2142 edges per
topic. For the speaker document networks, there was
an average of 63 nodes (speakers) and 545 edges per
topic.
4.2 Experimental Setup
We set up a pipeline using a Perl implementation
of tf-idf cosine similarity and MavenRank. We ran
MavenRank on the topic clusters and ranked the
speakers based on the output. We used two different
types granularities of the graphs as input: one where
the nodes are speech documents and another where
the nodes are speaker documents (see Section 2.1).
For the speech document graph, a speaker?s score is
determined by the sum of the MavenRank scores of
the speeches given by that speaker.
4.3 Evaluation Methods
To evaluate our output, we estimate independent
ordinary least squares linear regression models of
MavenRank centrality for topics with at least one re-
lated committee (there are 29 total):
MavenRankik = ?0k + ?skSeniorityik +
+?rkRankingMemberjk + ik (7)
where i indexes Senators, k indexes topics,
Seniorityik is the number of years Senator i has
served on the relevant committee for topic k (value
zero for those not on a relevant committee) and
RankingMemberjk has the value of one only for
the Chair and ranking minority member of a rele-
vant committee. We are interested primarily in the
overall significance of the estimated model (indicat-
ing committee effects) and, secondarily, in the spe-
cific source of any committee effect in seniority or
committee rank.
4.4 Results
Table 2 summarizes the results. ?Maven? status on
most topics does appear to be driven by committee
status, as expected. There are particularly strong ef-
fects of seniority and rank in topics tied to the Judi-
ciary, Foreign Relations, and Armed Services com-
mittees, as well as legislation-rich areas of domestic
policy. Perhaps of greater interest are the topics that
do not have committee effects. These are of three
distinct types. The first are highly politicized top-
ics for which speeches are intended not to influence

are not enough speeches for clear results, because
most debate occurred after 1999-2000 (post-9/11
intelligence reform, McCain-Feingold campaign fi-
nance reform).
Alternative models, using measures of centrality
based on the centroid were also examined. Dis-
tance to centroid provides broadly similar results as
MavenRank, with several marginal significance re-
sults reversed in each direction. Cosine similarity
with centroid, on the other hand, appears to have no
relationship with committee structure.
Figure 2 shows the MavenRank percentiles (us-
ing the speech document network) for Senators Rick
Santorum, Barbara Boxer, and Edward Kennedy
across a few topics in the 106th Senate. These
sample scores conform to the expected rankings for
these speakers. In this session, Santorum was the
sponsor of a bill to ban partial birth abortions and
was a spokesman for Social Security reform, which
support his high ranking in abortion and work-
ers/retirement. Boxer acted as the lead opposition
to Santorum?s abortion bill and is known for her
support of child abuse laws. Kennedy was ranking
member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions committee and the Judiciary committee (which
was involved with the abortion bill).
4.5 MavenRank in Other Contexts
MavenRank is a general method for finding central
speakers in a discussion and can be applied to areas
outside of political science. One potential applica-
tion would be analyzing blog posts to find ?Maven?
bloggers by treating blogs as speakers and posts as
speeches. Similarly, MavenRank could be used to
find central participants in a newsgroup, a forum, or
a collection of email conversations.
5 Conclusion
We have presented a technique for identifying lexi-
cally central speakers using a graph based method
called MavenRank. To test our method for find-
ing central speakers, we analyzed the Congressional
664
Record by creating a map from the clusters of
speeches to Senate committees and comparing the
natural ranking committee members to the output of
MavenRank. We found evidence of a possible rela-
tionship between the lexical centrality and commit-
tee rank of a speaker by ranking the speeches us-
ing MavenRank and computing the rank correlation
with the natural ordering of speakers. Some spe-
cific committees disagreed with our hypothesis that
MavenRank and committee position are correlated,
which we propose is because of the non-legislative
aspects of those specific committees. The results
of our experiment suggest that MavenRank can in-
deed be used to find central speakers in a corpus of
speeches.
We are currently working on applying our meth-
ods to the US House of Representatives and other
records of parliamentary speech from the United
Kingdom and Australia. We have also developed a
dynamic version of MavenRank that takes time into
account when finding lexical centrality and plan on
using it with the various parliamentary records. We
are interested in dynamic MavenRank to go further
with the idea of tracking how ideas get propagated
through a network of debates, including congres-
sional records, blogs, and newsgroups.
