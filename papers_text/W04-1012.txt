Abstract 
Summarization evaluation has been always a chal-
lenge to researchers in the document summariza-
tion field. Usually, human involvement is 
necessary to evaluate the quality of a summary. 
Here we present a new method for automatic  
evaluation of text summaries by using document 
graphs. Data from Document Understanding Con-
ference 2002 (DUC-2002) has been used in the 
experiment. We propose measuring the similarity 
between two summaries or between a summary 
and a document based on the concepts/entities and 
relations between them in the text.  
1 Introduction 
Document summarization has been the focus of 
many researchers for the last decade, due to the 
increase in on-line information and the need to 
find the most important information in a (set of) 
document(s). One of the biggest challenges in text 
summarization research is how to evaluate the 
quality of a summary or the performance of a 
summarization tool. There are different approa-
ches to evaluate overall quality of a summariza-
tion system. In general, there are two types of 
evaluation categories: intrinsic and extrinsic 
(Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996). Extrinsic ap-
proaches measure the quality of a summary based 
on how it affects certain tasks. In intrinsic approa-
ches, the quality of the summarization is evaluated 
based on analysis of the content of a summary 
itself. In both categories human involvement is 
used to judge the summarization outputs. The 
problem with having humans involved in evalua-
ting summaries is that we can not hire human jud-
ges every time we want to evaluate summaries 
(Mani and Maybury, 1999). In this paper, we dis-
cuss a new automated way to evaluate machine-
generated summaries without the need to have 
human judges being involved which decreases the 
cost of determining which summarization system 
is best. In our experiment, we used data from Do-
cument Understanding Conference 2002 (DUC-
2002). 
2 Related Work 
Researchers in the field of document summariza-
tion have been trying for many years to define a 
metric for evaluating the qua lity of a machine-
generated summary. Most of these attempts invol-
ve human interference, which make the process of 
evaluation expensive and time-consuming. We 
discuss some important work in the intrinsic cate-
gory. 
2.1 Sentence Precision-Recall Measure 
Sentence precision and recall have been widely 
used to evaluate the quality of a summarizer (Jing 
et al, 1998). Sentence precision measures the per-
cent of the summary that contains sentences mat-
ched with the model summary. Recall, on the 
other hand, measures the percent of sentences in 
the ideal summary that have been recalled in the 
summary. Even though sentence precision/recall 
factors can give us an idea about a summary?s 
quality, they are not the best metrics to evaluate a 
system?s quality. This is due to the fact that a 
small change in the output summary can dramati-
cally affect the quality of a summary (Jing et al, 
1998). For example, it is possible that a system 
will pick a sentence that does not match with a 
model sentence chosen by an assessor, but is 
equivalent to it in meaning. This, of course, will 
affect the score assigned to the system dramatica-
lly. It is also obvious that sentence precision/recall 
is only applicable to the summaries that are gene-
rated by sentence extraction, not abstraction (Ma-
ni, 2001).  
2.2 Content-Based Measure 
Content-based measure computes the similarity at 
the vocabulary level (Donaway, 2000 and Mani, 
2001). The evaluation is done by creating term 
frequency vectors for both the summary and the 
model summary, and measuring the cosine simila-
rity (Salton, 1988) between these two vectors. Of 
course, the higher the cosine similarity measure, 
the higher the quality of the summary is. Lin and 
Hovy (2002) used accumulative n-gram matching 
scores between model summaries and the summa-
ries to be evaluated as a performance indicator in 
multi-document summaries. They achieved their 
best results by giving more credit to longer n-
gram matches with the use of Porter stemmer.  
A problem raised in the evaluation approaches 
that use the cosine measure is that the summaries 
may use different key terms than those in the ori-
ginal documents or model summaries. Since term 
frequency is the base to score summaries, it is 
possible that a high quality summary will get a 
lower score if the terms used in the summary are 
not the same terms used in most of the document?s 
text. Donaway et al (2000) discussed using a 
common tool in information retrieval: latent se-
mantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al, 1990) to 
address this problem. The use of LSI reduces the 
effect of near-synonymy problem on the similarity 
score. This is done by penalizing the summary 
less in the reduced dimension model when there 
are infrequent terms synonymous to frequent 
terms. LSI averages the weights of terms that co-
occur frequently with other mutual terms. For 
example, both ?bank? and ?financial institution? 
often occur with the term ?account? (Deerwester 
et al, 1990). Even though using LSI can be useful 
in some cases, it can produce unexpected results 
when the document contains terms that are not 
synonymous to each other, but, however, they co-
occur with other mutual terms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3 Document Graph 
2.3.1 Representing Content by Document 
Graph 
Current approaches in content-based summariza-
tion evaluation ignore the relations between the 
keywords that are expressed in the document. 
Here, we introduce our approach, which measures 
the similarity between two summaries or a sum-
mary and a document based on the relations (bet-
ween the keywords). In our approach, each 
document/summary is represented as a document 
graph (DG), which is a directed graph of con-
cepts/entities and the relations between them. A 
DG contains two kinds of nodes, concept/entity 
nodes and relation nodes. Currently, only two 
kinds of relations, ?isa? and ?related to?, are cap-
tured (Santos et al 2001) for simplicity. 
To generate a DG, a document/summary in 
plain text format is first tokenized into sentences; 
and then, each sentence is parsed using Link Par-
ser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993), and the noun 
phrases (NP) are extracted from the parsing re-
sults. The relations are generated based on three 
heuristic rules: 
? The NP-heuristic helps to set up the hierar-
chical relations. For example, from a noun 
phrase ?folk hero stature?, we generate re-
lations ?folk hero stature isa stature?, ?folk 
hero stature related to  folk hero?, and ?folk 
hero isa hero?. 
? The NP-PP-heuristic attaches all preposi-
tional phrases to adjacent noun phrases. For 
example, from ?workers at a coal mine?, 
we generate a relation, ?worker related to 
coal mine?. 
? The sentence-heuristic rela tes con-
cepts/entities contained in one sentence. 
The relations created by sentence-heuristic 
are then sensitive to verbs, since the inter-
val between two noun phrases usually con-
tains a verb. For example, from a sentence 
?Workers at a coal mine went on strike?, 
we generate a relation ?worker related to 
strike?.  Another example, from ?The usual 
cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the 
coronary arteries?, we generate ?heart at-
tack cause related to  coronary artery bloc-
kage?. Figure 1 shows a  example of a 
partial DG.

2.3.2 Similarity Comparison between two 
Document Graphs 
The similarity of DG1 to DG2 is given by the 
equation:  
 
M
m
N
nDGDGSim
22
),( 21 +=  
 
which is modified from Montes-y-G?mez et al 
(2000). N is the number of concept/entity nodes in 
DG1, and M stands for number of relations in 
DG1; n is the number of matched concept/entity 
nodes in two DGs, and m is the number of mat-
ched relations. We say we find a matched relation 
in two different DGs, only when both of the two 
concept/entity nodes linked to the relation node 
are matched, and the relation node is also mat-
ched. Since we might compare two DGs that are 
significantly different in size (for example, DGs 
for an extract vs. its source document), we used 
the number of concept/entity nodes and relation 
nodes in the target DG as N and M, instead of the 
total number of nodes in both DGs. The target DG 
is the one for the extract in comparing an extract 
with its source text. Otherwise, the similarity will 
always be very low. Currently, we weight all the 
concepts/entities and relations equally. This can 
be fine tuned in the future.  
3 Data, and Experimental Design 
3.1 Data 
Because the data from DUC-2003 were short 
(~100 words per extract for multi-document task), 
we chose to use multi-document extracts from 
DUC-2002 (~200 words and ~400 words per ex-
tract for multi-document task) in our experiment. 
In this corpus, each of ten information analysts 
from the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) chose one set of newswi-
re/paper articles in the following topics (Over and 
Liggett, 2002): 
? A single natural disaster event with docu-
ments created within at most a 7-day win-
dow 
? A single event of any type with documents 
created within at most a 7-day window  
? Multiple distinct events of the same type (no 
time limit) 
? Biographical (discuss a single person) 
Each assessor chose 2 more sets of articles so 
that we ended up with a total of 15 document sets 
of each type. Each set contains about 10 docu-
ments. All documents in a set are mainly about a 
specific ?concept.? 
A total of ten automatic summarizers participa-
ted to produce machine-generated summaries. 
Two extracts of different lengths, 200 and 400 
words, have been generated for each document-
set. 
3.2 Experimental Design 
A total of 10 different automatic summarization 
systems submitted their summaries to DUC. We 
obtained a ranking order of these 10 systems ba-
sed on sentence precision/recall by comparing the 
machine generated extracts to the human genera-
ted model summaries. The F-factor is calculated 
from the following equation (Rijsbergen, 1979): 
)(
2
RP
RPF
+
??=   
where P is the precision and R is the recall. We 
think this ranking order gives us some idea on 
how human judges think about the performance of 
different systems.  
For our evaluation based on DGs, we also 
calculated F-factors based on precision and recall, 
where P = Sim(DG1, DG2) and R = Sim(DG2, 
DG1). In the first experiment, we ranked the 10 
automatic summarization systems by comparing 
DGs generated from their outputs to the DGs gen-
erated from model summaries. In this case, DG1 is 
the machine generated extract and DG2 is the hu-
man generated extract. In the second experiment, 
we ranked the systems by comparing machine 
generated extracts to the original documents. In 
this case, DG1 is an extract and DG2 is the corre-
sponding  original document. Since the extracts 
were  generated  from multi-document  sets,  we  
  
 
 
used the average of the F-factors for ranking pur-
poses. 
4  Results 
The ranking orders obtained based on sentence 
precisions and recalls are shown in Tables 1 and 
2.  The results indicate that for sentence precision 
and recall, the ranking order for different summa-
rization systems is not affected by the summariza-
tion compression ratio.  The ranking results for 
200-word extracts and 400-word extracts are ex-
actly the same. 
Since the comparison is between the machine 
generated extracts and the human created model 
extracts, we believe that the rankings should rep-
resent the performance of 10 different automated 
summarization systems, to some degree. The ex-
periments using DGs instead of sentence matching 
give two very similar ranking orders (Spearman 
rank correlation coefficient [Myers and Well, 
1995] is 0.988) where only systems 24 and 19 are 
reversed in their ranks (Tables 1 and 2). The re-
sults show that when the evaluation is based on 
the comparison between machine generated ex-
tracts and the model extracts, our DG-based 
evaluation approach will provide roughly the 
same ranking results as the sentence precision and 
recall approach. Notice that the F-factors obtained  
 
 
 
 
by experiments using DGs are higher than those 
calculated based on sentence matching. This is 
because our DG-based evaluation approach com-
pares the two extracts at a more fine grained level 
than sentence matching does since we compare 
the similarity at the level of concepts/entities and 
their relations, not just whole sentences. The simi-
larity of the two extracts should actually be higher 
than the score obtained with sentence matching 
because there are sentences that are equivalent in 
meaning but not syntactically identical. 
Since we believe that the DGs captures the se-
mantic information content contained in the res-
pective documents, we rank the automatic 
summarization systems by comparing the DGs of 
their extract outputs against the DGs of the orig i-
nal documents. This approach does not need the 
model summaries, and hence no human involve-
ment is needed in the evaluation. The results are 
shown in Tables 3 and 4. As we can see, our ran-
kings are different from the ranking results based 
on comparison against the model extracts.  System 
28 has the largest change in rank in both 200-word 
and 400-word summaries.  It was ranked as the 
worst by our DG based approach instead of num-
ber 7 (10 is the best) by the approaches comparing 
to the model extracts.  We investigated the extract 
content of system 28 and found that many extracts

John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as 
the politician closest to her heart, was elected by 
the Conservative Party Tuesday night to succeed 
her as prime minister. 
While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious 
issue of Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares 
her opposition to a single European currency and 
shares her belief in tight restraint on government 
spending. 
FT 08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: Major's blue

prime minister's popularity has plunged. 
The past 12 months have been hijacked by inter-
nal party differences over Europe, by the debacle 
surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange 
rates mechanism of the European Monetary Sys-
tem, and by a continuing, deep recession which 
has disappointed and alienated many traditional 
Tory supporters in business. 
Its Leader"] [Text] In local government elections 
across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffe-
red their worst defeat ever, losing control of 17 
regional councils and 444 seats. 
Even before all of the results were known, some 
Tories openly announced their determination to 
challenge John Major's position and remove him 
from office as early as possible. 
 
The extract generated by system 28 has 8 sen-
tences of which only one of them contained rele-
vant information. When comparing using sentence 
precision and recall, all three extracts only have 
one sentence match which is the first sentence. If 
we calculate the F-factors based on the model ex-
tract shown above, system 28 has a score of 0.143 
and system 29 has a lower score of 0.118.  After 
reading all three extracts, the extract generated by 
system 29 contains much more relevant informa-
tion than that generated by system 28. The mis-
sing information in system 28 is ---John Major 
and the Conservatives were losing the popularity 
in 1993, after John Major won the election one 
year ago,-- which should be the most important 
content in the extract. In our DG-based approach, 
the scores assigned to system 28 and 29 are 0.063 
and 0.100, respectively; which points out that sys-
tems 29 did a better job than system 28.

Table 5: Average F-factors for the model sum-
maries and machine-generated summaries. 
Of the 59 submitted 200-word extracts by sys-
tem 28, 39 extracts suffer the problem of having 
less informative sentences. The number of such 
sentences is 103, where the total number of sen-
tences is 406 from all the extracts for system 28. 
On average, each extract contains 1.75 such sen-
tences, where each extract has 6.88 sentences. For 
the 400-words extracts, we found 54 extracts 
among the 59 submitted summaries also have this 
problem. The total number of such sentences  was 
206, and the total number of sentences was 802 
sentences. So,  about 3.49 sentences do not con-
tain much information, where the average length 
of each extract is 13.59 sentences. Thus, a large  
 
 
 
portion of each extract does not contribute to the 
do example, will not be considered a good sum-
mary, either on the criterion of summary coheren-
ce or summary informativeness, where coherence 
is how the summary reads and informativeness is 
how much information from the source is preser-
ved in the summary (Mani, 2001). 
From the results based on comparing extracts 
against original documents, we found that several 
systems perform very similarly, especially in the 
experiments with 400-word extracts (Table 4). 
The results show that except for systems 22 and 
28 which perform significantly worse, all other 
systems are very similar, from the point of view of 
informativeness. 
Finally, we generated DGs for the model extra-
cts and then compared them against their original 
documents. The average F-factors are calculated, 
which are listed in Table 5 along with the scores 
for different automatic summarization systems. 
Intuitively, a system provides extracts that contain 
more information than other systems will get a 
higher score. As we can see from the data, at 200-
words, the extracts generated by systems 21, 31, 
24, 19, and 29 contain roughly the same amount 
of information as those created by humans, while 
the other five systems performed worse than 
human judges. At 400-words, when the compres-
sion ratio of the extracts is decreased, more sys-
tems perform well; only systems 22 and 28

5 Discussion and Future Work 
In DUC 2002 data collection, 9 human judges 
were involved in creating model extracts; how-
ever, there are only 2 model extracts generated for 
each document set. The sentence precisions and 
recalls obtained from comparing the machine gen-
erated extracts and human generated model ex-
tracts are distributed along with raw data (DUC-
2002. http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc), 
with the intent to use them in system performance 
comparison. Van Halteren (2002) argued that only 
two manually created extracts could not be used to 
form a sufficient basis for a good benchmark. To 
explore this issue, we obtained a ranking order for 
each human judge based on the extracts he/she 
generated.  The results showed that the ranking 
orders obtained from 9 different judges are actu-
ally similar to each other, with the average 
Spearman correlation efficient to be 0.901. From 
this point of view, if the ranking orders obtained 
by sentence precision and recall based on the 
model extracts could not form a good basis for a 
benchmark, it is because of its binary nature (Jing 
et al, 1998), not the lack of sufficient model ex-
tracts in DUC 2002 data.  
Van Halteren and Teufel (2003) proposed to 
evaluate summaries via factoids, a pseudo-
semantic representation based on atomic informa-
tion units. However, sufficient manually created 
model summaries are need; and factoids are also 
manually annotated. Donaway et al (2000) sug-
gested that it might be possible to use content-
based measures for summarization evaluation wit-
hout generating model summaries.  Here, we pre-
sented our approach to evaluate the summaries 
base on document graphs, which is generated au-
tomatically. It is not very surprising that different 
measures rank summaries differently. A similar 
observation has been reported previously (Radev, 
et al 2003). Our document graph approach on 
summarization evaluation is a new automatic way 
to evaluate machine-generated summaries, which 
measures the summaries from the point of view of 
informativeness. It has the potential to evaluate 
the quality of summaries, including extracts, abs-
tracts, and multi-document summaries, without 
human involvement. To improve the performance 
of our system and better represent the content of 
the summaries and source documents, we are 
working in several areas: 1) Improve the results of 
natural language processing to capture informa-
tion more accurately; 2) Incorporate a knowledge 
base, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), to ad-
dress the synonymy problem; and, 3) Use more 
heuristics in our relation extraction and genera-
tion. We are also going to extend our experiments 
by comparing our approach to content-based mea-
sure approaches, such as cosine similarity based 
on term frequencies and LSI approaches, in both 
extracts and abstracts.
