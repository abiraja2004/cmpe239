Abstract
We approach the zero-anaphora resolu-
tion problem by decomposing it into
intra-sentential and inter-sentential zero-
anaphora resolution. For the former prob-
lem, syntactic patterns of the appearance
of zero-pronouns and their antecedents are
useful clues. Taking Japanese as a target
language, we empirically demonstrate that
incorporating rich syntactic pattern fea-
tures in a state-of-the-art learning-based
anaphora resolution model dramatically
improves the accuracy of intra-sentential
zero-anaphora, which consequently im-
proves the overall performance of zero-
anaphora resolution.
1 Introduction
Zero-anaphora is a gap in a sentence that has an
anaphoric function similar to a pro-form (e.g. pro-
noun) and is often described as ?referring back?
to an expression that supplies the information nec-
essary for interpreting the sentence. For example,
in the sentence ?There are two roads to eternity,
a straight and narrow, and a broad and crooked,?
the gaps in ?a straight and narrow (gap)? and ?a
broad and crooked (gap)? have a zero-anaphoric
relationship to ?two roads to eternity.?
The task of identifying zero-anaphoric relations
in a given discourse, zero-anaphora resolution,
is essential in a wide range of NLP applications.
This is the case particularly in such a language as
Japanese, where even obligatory arguments of a
predicate are often omitted when they are inferable
from the context. In fact, in our Japanese newspa-
per corpus, for example, 45.5% of the nominative
arguments of verbs are omitted. Since such gaps
can not be interpreted only by shallow syntac-
tic parsing, a model specialized for zero-anaphora
resolution needs to be devised on the top of shal-
low syntactic and semantic processing.
Recent work on zero-anaphora resolution can
be located in two different research contexts. First,
zero-anaphora resolution is studied in the con-
text of anaphora resolution (AR), in which zero-
anaphora is regarded as a subclass of anaphora. In
AR, the research trend has been shifting from rule-
based approaches (Baldwin, 1995; Lappin and Le-
ass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997, etc.) to empirical, or
corpus-based, approaches (McCarthy and Lehnert,
1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002a; Soon et al, 2001;
Strube and Mu?ller, 2003; Yang et al, 2003) be-
cause the latter are shown to be a cost-efficient
solution achieving a performance that is compa-
rable to best performing rule-based systems (see
the Coreference task in MUC1 and the Entity De-
tection and Tracking task in the ACE program2).
The same trend is observed also in Japanese zero-
anaphora resolution, where the findings made in
rule-based or theory-oriented work (Kameyama,
1986; Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996; Okumura and
Tamura, 1996, etc.) have been successfully
incorporated in machine learning-based frame-
works (Seki et al, 2002; Iida et al, 2003).
Second, the task of zero-anaphora resolution
has some overlap with Propbank3-style semantic
role labeling (SRL), which has been intensively
studied, for example, in the context of the CoNLL
SRL task4. In this task, given a sentence ?To at-
tract younger listeners, Radio Free Europe inter-
sperses the latest in Western rock groups?, an SRL

model is asked to identify the NP Radio Free Eu-
rope as the A0 (Agent) argument of the verb at-
tract. This can be seen as the task of finding
the zero-anaphoric relationship between a nomi-
nal gap (the A0 argument of attract) and its an-
tecedent (Radio Free Europe) under the condition
that the gap and its antecedent appear in the same
sentence.
In spite of this overlap between AR and SRL,
there are some important findings that are yet to
be exchanged between them, partly because the
two fields have been evolving somewhat indepen-
dently. The AR community has recently made two
important findings:
? A model that identifies the antecedent of an
anaphor by a series of comparisons between
candidate antecedents has a remarkable ad-
vantage over a model that estimates the ab-
solute likelihood of each candidate indepen-
dently of other candidates (Iida et al, 2003;
Yang et al, 2003).
? An AR model that carries out antecedent
identification before anaphoricity determina-
tion, the decision whether a given NP is
anaphoric or not (i.e. discourse-new), sig-
nificantly outperforms a model that executes
those subtasks in the reverse order or simulta-
neously (Poesio et al, 2004; Iida et al, 2005).
To our best knowledge, however, existing SRL
models do not exploit these advantages. In SRL,
on the other hand, it is common to use syntactic
features derived from the parse tree of a given in-
put sentence for argument identification. A typ-
ical syntactic feature is the path on a parse tree
from a target predicate to a noun phrase in ques-
tion (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and Mar-
quez, 2005). However, existing AR models deal
with intra- and inter-sentential anaphoric relations
in a uniform manner; that is, they do not use as rich
syntactic features as state-of-the-art SRL models
do, even in finding intra-sentential anaphoric rela-
tions. We believe that the AR and SRL communi-
ties can learn more from each other.
Given this background, in this paper, we show
that combining the aforementioned techniques de-
rived from each research trend makes signifi-
cant impact on zero-anaphora resolution, taking
Japanese as a target language. More specifically,
we demonstrate the following:
? Incorporating rich syntactic features in a
state-of-the-art AR model dramatically im-
proves the accuracy of intra-sentential zero-
anaphora resolution, which consequently im-
proves the overall performance of zero-
anaphora resolution. This is to be considered
as a contribution to AR research.
? Analogously to inter-sentential anaphora, de-
composing the antecedent identification task
into a series of comparisons between candi-
date antecedents works remarkably well also
in intra-sentential zero-anaphora resolution.
We hope this finding to be adopted in SRL.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the task definition of zero-
anaphora resolution in Japanese. In Section 3,
we review previous approaches to AR. Section 4
described how the proposed model incorporates
effectively syntactic features into the machine
learning-based approach. We then report the
results of our experiments on Japanese zero-
anaphora resolution in Section 5 and conclude in
Section 6.
2 Zero-anaphora resolution
In this paper, we consider only zero-pronouns that
function as an obligatory argument of a predicate
for two reasons:
? Providing a clear definition of zero-pronouns
appearing in adjunctive argument positions
involves awkward problems, which we be-
lieve should be postponed until obligatory
zero-anaphora is well studied.
? Resolving obligatory zero-anaphora tends to
be more important than adjunctive zero-
pronouns in actual applications.
A zero-pronoun may have its antecedent in the dis-
course; in this case, we say the zero-pronoun is
anaphoric. On the other hand, a zero-pronoun
whose referent does not explicitly appear in the
discourse is called a non-anaphoric zero-pronoun.
A zero-pronoun may be non-anaphoric typically
when it refers to an extralinguistic entity (e.g. the
first or second person) or its referent is unspecified
in the context.
The following are Japanese examples. In sen-
tence (1), zero-pronoun ?i is anaphoric as its an-
tecedent, ?shusho (prime minister)?, appears in the
same sentence. In sentence (2), on the other hand,
?j is considered non-anaphoric if its referent (i.e.
the first person) does not appear in the discourse.
(1) shushoi-wa houbeisi-te ,
prime ministeri-TOP visit-U.S.-CONJ PUNC
626
ryoukoku-no gaikou-o
both countries-BETWEEN diplomacy-OBJ
(?i-ga) suishinsuru
(?i-NOM) promote-ADNOM

The prime minister visited the united states
and unveiled the plan to push diplomacy
between the two countries.
(2) (?j-ga) ie-ni kaeri-tai .
(?j -NOM) home-DAT want to go back PUNC
(I) want to go home.
Given this distinction, we consider the task of
zero-anaphora resolution as the combination of
two sub-problems, antecedent identification and
anaphoricity determination, which is analogous to
NP-anaphora resolution:
For each zero-pronoun in a given dis-
course, find its antecedent if it is
anaphoric; otherwise, conclude it to be
non-anaphoric.
3 Previous work
3.1 Antecedent identification
Previous machine learning-based approaches to
antecedent identification can be classified as ei-
ther the candidate-wise classification approach or
the preference-based approach. In the former ap-
proach (Soon et al, 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002a,
etc.), given a target anaphor, TA, the model esti-
mates the absolute likelihood of each of the candi-
date antecedents (i.e. the NPs preceding TA), and
selects the best-scored candidate. If all the can-
didates are classified negative, TA is judged non-
anaphoric.
In contrast, the preference-based ap-
proach (Yang et al, 2003; Iida et al, 2003)
decomposes the task into comparisons of the
preference between candidates and selects the
most preferred one as the antecedent. For exam-
ple, Iida et al (2003) proposes a method called
the tournament model. This model conducts a
tournament consisting of a series of matches in
which candidate antecedents compete with each
other for a given anaphor.
While the candidate-wise classification model
computes the score of each single candidate inde-
pendently of others, the tournament model learns
the relative preference between candidates, which
is empirically proved to be a significant advan-
tage over candidate-wise classification (Iida et al,
2003).
3.2 Anaphoricity determination
There are two alternative ways for anaphoric-
ity determination: the single-step model and the
two-step model. The single-step model (Soon et
al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002a) determines the
anaphoricity of a given anaphor indirectly as a
by-product of the search for its antecedent. If
an appropriate candidate antecedent is found, the
anaphor is classified as anaphoric; otherwise, it is
classified as non-anaphoric. One disadvantage of
this model is that it cannot employ the preference-
based model because the preference-based model
is not capable of identifying non-anaphoric cases.
The two-step model (Ng, 2004; Poesio et al,
2004; Iida et al, 2005), on the other hand, car-
ries out anaphoricity determination in a separate
step from antecedent identification. Poesio et
al. (2004) and Iida et al (2005) claim that the lat-
ter subtask should be done before the former. For
example, given a target anaphor (TA), Iida et al?s
selection-then-classification model:
1. selects the most likely candidate antecedent
(CA) of TA using the tournament model,
2. classifies TA paired with CA as either
anaphoric or non-anaphoric using an
anaphoricity determination model. If the
CA-TA pair is classified as anaphoric, CA is
identified as the antecedent of TA; otherwise,
TA is conclude to be non-anaphoric.
The anaphoricity determination model learns the
non-anaphoric class directly from non-anaphoric
training instances whereas the single-step model
cannot not use non-anaphoric cases in training.
4 Proposal
4.1 Task decomposition
We approach the zero-anaphora resolution prob-
lem by decomposing it into two subtasks: intra-
sentential and inter-sentential zero-anaphora reso-
lution. For the former problem, syntactic patterns
in which zero-pronouns and their antecedents ap-
pear may well be useful clues, which, however,
does not apply to the latter problem. We there-
fore build a separate component for each sub-
task, adopting Iida et al (2005)?s selection-then-
classification model for each component:
1. Intra-sentential antecedent identification:
For a given zero-pronoun ZP in a given
sentence S, select the most-likely candidate
antecedent C?1 from the candidates appearing
in S by the intra-sentential tournament model
627
2. Intra-sentential anaphoricity determination:
Estimate plausibility p1 that C?1 is the true an-
tecedent, and return C?1 if p1 ? ?intra (?intra
is a preselected threshold) or go to 3 other-
wise
3. Inter-sentential antecedent identification:
Select the most-likely candidate antecedent
C?2 from the candidates appearing outside of
S by the inter-sentential tournament model.
4. Inter-sentential anaphoricity determination:
Estimate plausibility p2 that C?2 is the true
antecedent, and return C?2 if p2 ? ?inter
(?inter is a preselected threshold) or return
non-anaphoric otherwise.
4.2 Representation of syntactic patterns
In the first two of the above four steps, we use syn-
tactic pattern features. Analogously to SRL, we
extract the parse path between a zero-pronoun to
its antecedent to capture the syntactic pattern of
their occurrence. Among many alternative ways
of representing a path, in the experiments reported
in the next section, we adopted a method as we
describe below, leaving the exploration of other al-
ternatives as future work.
Given a sentence, we first use a standard depen-
dency parser to obtain the dependency parse tree,
in which words are structured according to the de-
pendency relation between them. Figure 1(a), for
example, shows the dependency tree of sentence
(1) given in Section 2. We then extract the path
between a zero-pronoun and its antecedent as in
Figure 1(b). Finally, to encode the order of sib-
lings and reduce data sparseness, we further trans-
form the extracted path as in Figure 1(c):
? A path is represented by a subtree consist-
ing of backbone nodes: ? (zero-pronoun),
Ant (antecedent), Node (the lowest common
ancestor), LeftNode (left-branch node) and
RightNode.
? Each backbone node has daughter nodes,
each corresponding to a function word asso-
ciated with it.
? Content words are deleted.
This way of encoding syntactic patterns is used
in intra-sentential anaphoricity determination. In
antecedent identification, on the other hand, the
tournament model allows us to incorporate three
paths, a path for each pair of a zero-pronoun and
left and right candidate antecedents, as shown in

4.3 Learning algorithm
As noted in Section 1, the use of zero-pronouns
in Japanese is relatively less constrained by syn-
tax compared, for example, with English. This
forces the above way of encoding path information
to produce an explosive number of different paths,
which inevitably leads to serious data sparseness.
This issue can be addressed in several ways.
The SRL community has devised a range of
variants of the standard path representation to
reduce the complexity (Carreras and Marquez,
2005). Applying Kernel methods such as Tree
kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and Hierarchi-
cal DAG kernels (Suzuki et al, 2003) is another
strong option. The Boosting-based algorithm pro-
5To indicate which node belongs to which subtree, the la-
bel of each node is prefixed either with L, R or I.

posed by Kudo and Matsumoto (2004) is designed
to learn subtrees useful for classification.
Leaving the question of selecting learning al-
gorithms open, in our experiments, we have so
far examined Kudo and Matsumoto (2004)?s al-
gorithm, which is implemented as the BACT sys-
tem6. Given a set of training instances, each of
which is represented as a tree labeled either pos-
itive or negative, the BACT system learns a list
of weighted decision stumps with a Boosting al-
gorithm. Each decision stump is associated with
tuple ?t, l, w?, where t is a subtree appearing in
the training set, l a label, and w a weight, indicat-
ing that if a given input includes t, it gives w votes
to l. The strength of this algorithm is that it deals
with structured feature and allows us to analyze
the utility of features.
In antecedent identification, we train the tour-
nament model by providing a set of labeled trees
as a training set, where a label is either left or
right. Each labeled tree has (i) path trees TL,
TR and TI (as given in Figure 2) and (ii) a set
nodes corresponding to the binary features sum-
marized in Table 3, each of which is linked to
the root node as illustrated in Figure 4. This way
of organizing a labeled tree allows the model to
learn, for example, the combination of a subtree
of TL and some of the binary features. Anal-
ogously, for anaphoricity determination, we use
trees (TC , f1, . . . , fn), where TC denotes a path
subtree as in Figure 1(c).
5 Experiments
We conducted an evaluation of our method using
Japanese newspaper articles. The following four
models were compared:
1. BM: Ng and Cardie (2002a)?s model,
which identify antecedents by the candidate-
wise classification model, and determine
anaphoricity using the one-step model.
6http://chasen.org/?taku/software/bact/
2. BM STR: BM with the syntactic features
such as those in Figure 1(c).
3. SCM: The selection-then-classification
model explained in Section 3.
4. SCM STR: SCM with all types of syntactic
features shown in Figure 2.
5.1 Setting
We created an anaphoric relation-tagged corpus
consisting of 197 newspaper articles (1,803 sen-
tences), 137 articles annotated by two annotators
and 60 by one. The agreement ratio between two
annotators on the 197 articles was 84.6%, which
indicated that the annotation was sufficiently reli-
able.
In the experiments, we removed from the
above data set the zero-pronouns to which the
two annotators did not agree. Consequently, the
data set contained 995 intra-sentential anaphoric
zero-pronouns, 754 inter-sentential anaphoric
zero-pronouns, and 603 non-anaphoric zero-
pronouns (2,352 zero-pronouns in total), with each
anaphoric zero-pronoun annotated to be linked to
its antecedent. For each of the following exper-
iments, we conducted five-fold cross-validation
over 2,352 zero-pronouns so that the set of the
zero-pronouns from a single text was not divided
into the training and test sets.
In the experiments, all the features were auto-
matically acquired with the help of the follow-
ing NLP tools: the Japanese morphological ana-
lyzer ChaSen7 and the Japanese dependency struc-
ture analyzer CaboCha8, which also carried out
named-entity chunking.
5.2 Results on intra-sentential zero-anaphora
resolution
In both intra-anaphoricity determination and an-
tecedent identification, we investigated the effect
of introducing the syntactic features for improv-
ing the performance. First, the results of an-
tecedent identification are shown in Table 1. The
comparison between BM (SCM) with BM STR
(SCM STR) indicates that introducing the struc-
tural information effectively contributes to this
task. In addition, the large improvement from
BM STR to SCM STR indicates that the use of
the preference-based model has significant impact
on intra-sentential antecedent identification. This

finding may well contribute to semantic role label-
ing because these two tasks have a large overlap as
discussed in Section 1.
Second, to evaluate the performance of intra-
sentential zero-anaphora resolution, we plotted
recall-precision curves altering threshold parame-
ter and ?inter for intra-anaphoricity determination
as shown in Figure 5, where recall R and precision
P were calculated by:
R = # of detected antecedents correctly# of anaphoric zero-pronouns ,
P = # of detected antecedents correctly# of zero-pronouns classified as anaphoric .
The curves indicate the upperbound of the perfor-
mance of these models; in practical settings, the
parameters have to be trained beforehand.
Figure 5 shows that BM STR (SCM STR) out-
performs BM (SCM), which indicates that in-
corporating syntactic pattern features works re-
markably well for intra-sentential zero-anaphora

resolution. Futhermore, SCM STR is signif-
icantly better than BM STR. This result sup-
ports that the former has an advantage of learn-
ing non-anaphoric zero-pronouns (181 instances)
as negative training instances in intra-sentential
anaphoricity determination, which enables it to re-
ject non-anaphoric zero-pronouns more accurately
than the others.
5.3 Discussion
Our error analysis reveals that a majority of er-
rors can be attributed to the current way of han-
dling quoted phrases and sentences. Figure 6
shows the difference in resolution accuracy be-
tween zero-pronouns appearing in a quotation

pronouns), where ?IN Q? denotes the former (in-
quote zero-pronouns) and ?OUT Q? the latter.
The accuracy on the IN Q problems is consider-
ably lower than that on the OUT Q cases, which
indicates that we should deal with in-quote cases
with a separate model so that it can take into ac-
count the nested structure of discourse segments
introduced by quotations.
5.4 Impact on overall zero-anaphora
resolution
We next evaluated the effects of introducing the
proposed model on overall zero-anaphora resolu-
tion including inter-sentential cases.
As a baseline model, we implemented the origi-
nal SCM, designed to resolve intra-sentential zero-
anaphora and inter-sentential zero-anaphora si-
multaneously with no syntactic pattern features.
Here, we adopted Support Vector Machines (Vap-
nik, 1998) to train the classifier on the baseline

For the proposed model, we plotted several
recall-precision curves by selecting different value
for threshold parameters ?intra and ?inter. The re-
sults are shown in Figure 7, which indicates that
the proposed model significantly outperforms the
original SCM if ?intra is appropriately chosen.
We then investigated the feasibility of parameter
selection for ?intra by plotting the AUC values for
different ?intra values. Here, each AUC value is
the area under a recall-precision curve. The results
are shown in Figure 8. Since the original SCM
does not use ?intra, the AUC value of it is constant,
depicted by the SCM. As shown in the Figure 8,
the AUC-value curve of the proposed model is not
peaky, which indicates the selection of parameter
?intra is not difficult.

6 Conclusion
In intra-sentential zero-anaphora resolution, syn-
tactic patterns of the appearance of zero-pronouns
and their antecedents are useful clues. Taking
Japanese as a target language, we have empirically
demonstrated that incorporating rich syntactic pat-
tern features in a state-of-the-art learning-based
anaphora resolution model dramatically improves
the accuracy of intra-sentential zero-anaphora,
which consequently improves the overall perfor-
mance of zero-anaphora resolution.
In our next step, we are going to address the is-
sue of how to find zero-pronouns, which requires
us to design a broader framework that allows zero-
anaphora resolution to interact with predicate-
argument structure analysis. Another important
issue is how to find a globally optimal solution
to the set of zero-anaphora resolution problems
in a given discourse, which leads us to explore
methods as discussed by McCallum and Well-
ner (2003).
