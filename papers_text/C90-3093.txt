Introduction 
The pro jec t  note  presents  the  computer  program 
GECO (GEometry COnsu l te r ) ,  wh ich  generates  
exp lanat ions  (descr ip t ions )  o f  geometr i ca l  
concepts  in  Bu lgar ian .  Tile program rep l ies  to  
quest io t~s  such as  "What i s  X",  "Compare X and Y ' ,  
where X and Y are  concepts  in  geometry .  The idea  
to design GECO was in i t ia l l y  inspired by 
\ [HcKeown,1985\ ] ,  which gives information on 
missiles? However, unl ike TEXT, our system is 
able to give two types of descriptions : detai led 
and br ie f .  For instance, i f  we ask "What is  a 
t r iang le" ,  GECO gives a detai led descript ion, 
including de f in i t ion ,  the character is t ic  and non~ 
character is t ic  features of the t r iang le ,  but i f  
we ask once again within a dialogue the same 
question, the program remind~ us shortly the 
definition of the concept triangle. This is done 
by means of a special stack, which keeps a 
formalized dialogue history.  As in normal human 
d ia logue ,  the Systems rep l ies  to  a repeated  
question in past tense (this is specific at least 
of  Bu lgar ian) .  Here i s  a " recorded"  d ia logue  
between user  and GECO: 
User: What is a tr iangle? 
GECO: The t r iang le  is a convex 
stra ight ' l inear  plane geometrical f igure ,  which 
possesses 3 sides. According to i t s  sides the 
t r iang le  can be equ i la tera l ,  isosceles and 
sca lene  and accord ing  to  i t s  ang les  ~ r ight -  
ang led ,  acute -ang led  and obtuse-ang led .  
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
User :  What i s  a t r iang le?  
GECO: The t r iang le  was a convex ,  
s t ra ight l inear  and plane geometrical f igure,  
which has three sides. 
I n  our  model o f  natura l  language generat ion ,  
we assume, that  the  task  o f  language 9enerat ion  
can be divided into two stages: a conceptual and 
a l ingu is t i c  stage. We agree with Danlos' claim 
\[Danlo~, 1985\], that the conceptual and 
linguistic stage cannot be completely 
i ndependent .  That  i s  why not  a l l  dec is ions  in  the  
Conceptua l  s tage  o f  GECO are  to be f ixed 
invariably.  
In \[Roesner, 1986\] i~ given a typology of 
explanations. According to th is  typology, the 
explanations, generated by our system are 
"informative xplanations, of s ta t i c  kind" ( th is  
type  inc ludes  the explanations of concepts ,  what 
is our case). Roesner proposes, that th i s  type of 
explanations should possibly include definitions, 
short descr ipt ive information, indicat ion,  where 
more information can be found, re lat ions  between 
concepts etc. Or ig ina l ly ,  GECO was  i n tu i t i ve ly  so  
des igned,  that i t  p ract i ca l ly  met these  
formal demands. 
Sublangua~ and discourse 
The system has to do with the sublanguage of 
school geometry (taught in bulgarian schools). 
This sublanguage uses a comparatively rest r ic ted 
lexicon and not too great var iety of syntactic 
constructions. I t s  texts  (what is to be read in 
the textbooks), however , are often overloaded 
with very complicated complex sentences. Good 
sct~ool geometry  texts  a re  presented  in  ba lanced  
way by s imple  and complex sentences .  
Studying discourse pecualiarities of school 
geometry instruct ional  texts  helped us to design 
discourse rules, made use by the conceptual 
module, when ordering the content within a text .  
Generat ion  o f  text  requ i res  the  ab i l i ty  how to  
o rgan ize  ind iv idua l  sentences .  A reasonab le  
wri ter  does not randomly  order  the  sentences in 
his text ,  but rather plans an overal l  framework 
or out l ine,  from which the individual sentences 
are  produced.  Character i s t i c  of the  descr ip t ion  
of a geometrical concept is the introduction of 
i t s  superordinate, i t s  constituents and providing 
some addit ional  information to i t  (e.g. 
var ie t ies ) .  In th is  way the descript ion of the 
geometrical concept  "quadr i la tera l "  possibly 
includes i t s  superordinate (polygon), i t s  
constituents (4 s t ra ight l inear  sides, which bui ld 
up a convex f igure and l ie  in one plane, i .d.  i t  
has 4 sides and is convex, s t ra ight l inear  and 
plane) and i t s  var ie t ies  (parallelogram, 
rectangular e tc . ) .  
Semant ic  kr~w1ed@e repremenJ~t ion  m~le l  
The semant ic  knowledge representat ion  model 
used in the  System and proposed  by the  autor  is 
an extension of the model of Tiemann and Markle 
\[Tiemann and Harkle, 1978\] fo r  concept semantic 
t 425  
knowledge representation. The proposed model 
describes each concept as a set of c r i t i ca l  and 
variable at t r ibutes .  The concept introduces a 
class of things, objects, events, ideas or 
re lat ions ,  so that each member of th is  class 
possesses the same label, On the other hand i t  is  
possible that a l l  the members of a class d i f fe r  
in one way or another and nevertheless are 
classif ied together. The character ist ic  features, 
possessed by all the members in a class are 
cal led crit ical attributes. Variable attr ibutes 
are defined as character ist ic  features, which 
might d i f fe r  within class members. 
Consider the concept " t r iang le" .  Our 
semantic knowledge representation model w i l l  
descr ibe  i t  fo rmal ly  as  fo l lows :  
Triangle (geometrical f igure / plane, convex, 
s t ra ight l inear ,  three sides / acute-angled, 
r ight-angled, obtuse-angled; equ i la tera l ,  
i sosce les ,  sca lene/O) .  
The for l la l i sm o f  functi~nal descr ip t i~s  
Di f ferent  Formalisms require d i f fe rent  
approaches, whose var iety may be sometimes 
(especial ly in implementation) problematic, We 
have adopted  in  our  model and system an extended 
functional descript ion (FD) formalism, developed 
by Rousselot \[Rousselot, 1985\]. This formalism 
enables the representation o f  a l l  types of 
knowledge.  A FD represents  a l i s t  o f  a t t r ibute -  
value pairs, j Rousselot's formalism is a very 
extended form of the functional grammars \ [Kay,  
1985\]. Within the notation of FD we represent in 
the domain knowledge base the geometrical 
concepts (using the above concept semantic 
representation approach) and the re lat ions  among 
them . We represent also as FDs the grammar rules 
in the l inguistic knowledge base. 
The ro le o f  l~ ica l  emphasis 
D i f fe rent  text  generat ion  systems make use 
o f  d i f fe rent  syntax  se lec t ion  approaches .  The 
phenomena of focus is wide ly  used in text  
generat ion  \ [Der r  and McKeown, 1984\ ] ,  \[McKeown, 
1985\]. In b r ie f ,  i f  the focus is on the 
protagon is t  o f  the  sentence  an act ive  
construction is  chosen, and i f  the focus is on 
the goal - a passive one. Thus i f  the system TEXT 
\[McKeown,1985\] should express the fact ,  that a 
t r iang le  and c i rc le  touch each other and i f  the 
focus is  on the protagonist (say t r iang le ) ,  the 
system would  generate  "The t r iang le  touches  the  
c i rc le" ,  but i f  the focus is  on the goal (say 
c i rc le ) ,  the fo l lowi ing  sentence would be 
produced "The t r iang le  is touched by the c i rc le" .  
Dan los  \ [Dan los ,1985\ ]  makes use o f  "d i scourse  
grammar", that spec i f ies  the  syntax of  each 
sentence .  
In our work we have elaborated for  the f i r s t  
time on the logical  emphasis approach for  the 
sentence  syntax  se lec t ion .  The log ica l  emphas is  
in free order BulBarian is la id  on the last  word 
of the sentence. I t  plays a leading role in 
choosing the  word order  in a sentence :  the  fac t  
that the  t r iang le  has three  s ides  may be 
verbalized as "the t r iang le  has three sides" i f  
the  log ica l  emphas is  i s  on "s ides"  o r  as  " three  
s ides  has the  t r iang le"  provided the  log ica l  
emphasis is on " t r iang le" .  
Production of  text  
The grammar used to  produce  the  pre l iminary  
sur face  s t ruc ture  o f  the  generated  sentences  i s  
the functional un i f i ca t ion  grammar \[Kay, 1985\]. 
I f  a simple sentence grammar pattern (subject 
verb object) with value "protagonist" for  the 
funcional role (a t t r ibute)  " logical  emphasis" is 
uni f ied with the FD from the domain knowledge 
base, describing the re la t ion ,  that each t r iang le  
has three sides, the fol lowing sentence w i l l  be 
generated :  
The t r iang le  possesses  three  s ides ,  
while the value "goal" for  the a t t r ibute  " logical  
emphasis" y ie lds the result :  
Three  s ides  has the t r iang le .  
However ,  the  sentence  generated  by u~i fy ing  
the  functional un i f i ca t ion  grammar with the  input 
and representing a fact about or related to a 
concept is not the f ina l  sentence thE) system 
of fe rs  to i t s  users. Although the result ing 
sentences of the previous examples sound quite 
reasonab ly  ( in  Bulgarian), the system would  not 
be able to impress always i t s  users i f  i t  accepts 
the sentence as f ina l .  The problem is that each 
exp lanat ion  o f  a concept  i s  not  a s ing le  
sentence, but discourse. To i l l us t ra te  our 
posit ion,  assume that the system has to give a 
detailed ( in i t ia l )  description of the concept 
" t r iang le"  (such description is actual ly  given by 
our system, see in the dialogue f i r s t  answer). 
After consecutive un i f i ca t ions  of the grammar 
rules with the relevant inputs , the system would 
generate in the best case the fol lowing 'text: 
The t r iang le  is a geometrical 
f igure.  The t r iang le  is s t ra ight l inear .  
The t r iang le  is plane (plane as 
adject ive) .  The t r iang le  is convex. The 
t r iang le  has three sides. The t r iang le  
can be isosceles, equi latera l  and 
scalene according to i t s  sides. The 
t r iang le  can be r ight-angled, acute-- 
angled and obtuse-angles according to 
i t s  angles.

This is  a clumsy text ,  that no reasonable 
man would write.  The three main l ingu is t i c  
operations (part of the sys tem's  linguistic 
knowledge) that will process this priliminary 
text are coordination, pronominalization and 
e l l ips i s .  Note that coordination w i l l  work on the 
f i r s t  'four sentences, pronominalization - on the 
fifth sentence and ellipsis - on the sentence 
obtained from coord inat ion  of the last two 
sentences  (before these  three  operations a 
rhetoric ru le  w i l l  have  operated, which says, 
that "according to" sounds better at the 
beginning of the sentence and is not subject to 
deletion during coordination). The processed text 
wi l l  be: 
The t r iang le  i s  a s t ra ight l inear .  
p lane  and convex  geometr i ca l  f igure ,  I t  
has three  s ides .  The t r iang le  can be 
isosceles, equ i la tera l  and sca lene  
accord ing  to its sides. The t r iang le  
can be r ight -ang led ,  acute -ang led  and 
obtuse-ang led  accord ing  to its angles. 
According to i t s  s ides the  t r iang le  can 
be equilateral, isosceles and scalene 
and according to its angles - right- 
angled, acute-angled and obtuse-angled. 
There  are  a l so  fu r ther  l ingu is t i c  dec is ions  
to  be made: shou ld  the  sentence  be in  ac t ive  or  
in  passive voice, should two or  more s imple  
sentences  be combined in to  a s ing le  complex one 
(in the last sample text the first two sentences 
can be combined into a complex one), how 
subordinate clauses should be handled (we have 
deve loped severa l  p rocedures  to  t reat  the  
production and connection of  subordinate 
clauses), should 9erundium be used etc. In text  
generation systems such decisions are made on the 
basis of lin9uistic phenomena such as focus, 
logical emphasis (in our case), causality etc. 
and are hot to be discussed in the present paper. 
Grmt i~ l  accordance  
Since Bulgarian is  a highly in f lec t ive  
language ( in f lec t ion  a f fect ing  not only nouns, 
but also adjectives, numerals, pronouns etc.), we 
have developed additional algorithms for 
grammatical accordance. We have developed an 
algorithm, which determines automatically the 
gender of the Bulgarian nouns (consisting of 254 
steps). Another algorithm gives the definite 
article (in Bulgarian as a inflection; there 
ex is t  various de f in i te  a r t i c le  in f lec t ions)  of 
each noun and works parallelly to the first one. 
However, i f  a Bulgarian noun is in i t s  de f in i te  
a r t i c le  form, i t  is impossible to determine 
a lgor i thmica l ly  i t s  gender. Therefore we have 
developed addit ional  algorithms for  transforming 
def in i te  a r t i c le  form of nouns into indef in i te  
article (normal) forms. Moreover ,  the adjectives, 
numerals, the demonstrative and personal pronouns 
i n  Bu lgar ian  accord  w i th  the  nouns.  Consequent ly  
we have developed and implemented algorithms for' 
determining the indef in i te  a r t i c le  form of 
adjectives (numerals, pronouns) and from i t  the 
gender form and def in i te  a r t i c le  form of 
ad jec t ives  (numera ls ,  p ronouns) .  
I ip lementat  ion  
GECO is a program, designed for  
instruct ional  and experimental purposes. I t s  most 
part has been already programmed on IBM PC/XT/AT 
(in Ksi Prolog). The FDs are described within 
Prolog Def in i te  Clause Grammars (DFG) notation. 
Thus we have implemented a surface generation 
based on both the DFG formalism and the formalism 
of FDs. This idea we have adopted from Derr and 
McKeown \[Derr and HcKeown, 1984\]. The result is a 
generator with the best features of both 
grammars: s imp l i f i ca t i ion  of input by using 
functional information and e f f i c iency  of 
execution from Prolog.
