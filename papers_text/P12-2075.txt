Abstract
In this paper, we present an unsupervized seg-
mentation system tested on Mandarin Chi-
nese. Following Harris's Hypothesis in Kempe
(1999) and Tanaka-Ishii's (2005) reformulation,
we base our work on the Variation of Branching
Entropy. We improve on (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii,
2006) by adding normalization and viterbi-
decoding. This enable us to remove most of
the thresholds and parameters from their model
and to reach near state-of-the-art results (Wang
et al, 2011) with a simpler system. We provide
evaluation on different corpora available from
the Segmentation bake-off II (Emerson, 2005)
and define a more precise topline for the task
using cross-trained supervized system available
off-the-shelf (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Zhao and
Kit, 2008; Huang and Zhao, 2007)
1 Introduction
The Chinese script has no explicit ?word? bound-
aries. Therefore, tokenization itself, although the
very first step of many text processing systems, is
a challenging task. Supervized segmentation sys-
tems exist but rely on manually segmented corpora,
which are often specific to a genre or a domain and
use many different segmentation guidelines. In order
to deal with a larger variety of genres and domains,
or to tackle more theoretic questions about linguistic
units, unsupervized segmentation is still an impor-
tant issue. After a short review of the corresponding
literature in Section 2, we discuss the challenging is-
sue of evaluating unsupervized word segmentation
systems in Section 3. Section 4 and Section 5 present
the core of our system. Finally, in Section 6, we de-
tail and discuss our results.
2 State of the Art
Unsupervized word segmentation systems tend to
make use of three different types of information: the
cohesion of the resulting units (e.g., Mutual Infor-
mation, as in (Sproat and Shih, 1990)), the degree of
separation between the resulting units (e.g., Acces-
sor Variety, see (Feng et al, 2004)) and the proba-
bility of a segmentation given a string (Goldwater et
al., 2006; Mochihashi et al, 2009).
A recently published work by Wang et al (2011)
introduce ESA: ?Evaluation, Selection, Adjust-
ment.? This method combines cohesion and separa-
tion measures in a ?goodness? metric that is maxi-
mized during an iterative process. This work is the
current state-of-the-art in unsupervized segmenta-
tion of Mandarin Chinese data.
The main drawbacks of ESA are the need to iterate
the process on the corpus around 10 times to reach
good performance levels and the need to set a param-
eter that balances the impact of the cohesion measure
w.r.t. the separation measure. Empirically, a corre-
lation is found between the parameter and the size of
the corpus but this correlation depends on the script
used in the corpus (it changes if Latin letters and
Arabic numbers are taken into account during pre-
processing or not). Moreover, computing this cor-
relation and finding the best value for the parameter
(i.e., what the authors call the proper exponent) re-
quires a manually segmented training corpus. There-
fore, this proper exponent may not be easily available
in all situations. However, if we only consider their
experiments using settings similar to ours, their re-
sults consistently lie around an f-score of 0.80.
An older approach, introduced by Jin and Tanaka-
Ishii (2006), solely relies on a separation measure
383
that is directly inspired by a linguistic hypothesis for-
mulated by Harris (1955). In Tanaka-Ishii (2005)
(following Kempe (1999)) who use Branching En-
tropy (BE), this hypothesis goes as follows: if se-
quences produced by human language were random,
we would expect the Branching Entropy of a se-
quence (estimated from the n-grams in a corpus)
to decrease as we increase the length of the se-
quence. Therefore the variation of the branching en-
tropy (VBE) should be negative. When we observe
that it is not the case, Harris hypothesizes that we
are at a linguistic boundary. Following this hypoth-
esis, (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006) propose a system
that segments when BE is rising or when it reach a
certain maximum.
The main drawback of Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006)
model is that segmentation decisions are taken very
locally1 and do not depend on neighboring cuts.
Moreover, this system also also relies on parameters,
namely the threshold on the VBE above which the
system decides to segment (in their system, this is
when VBE? 0). In theory, we could expect a de-
creasing BE and look for a less decreasing value (or
on the contrary, rising at least to some extent). A
threshold of 0 can be seen as a default value. Fi-
nally, Jin and Tanaka-Ishii do not take in account that
VBE of n-gram may not be directly comparable to
the VBE of m-grams if m ?= n. A normalization is
needed (as in (Cohen et al, 2002)).
Due to space constraints, we shall not describe
here other systems than those by Wang et al (2011)
and Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006). A more compre-
hensive state of the art can be found in (Zhao and
Kit, 2008) and (Wang et al, 2011).
In this paper we will show that we can correct the
drawbacks of Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006) model and
reach performances comparable to those of Wang et
al. (2011) with as simpler system.
3 Evaluation
In this paper, in order to be comparable with
Wang et al (2011), we evaluate our system against
the corpora from the Second International Chi-
nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005).
These corpora cover 4 different segmentation guide-
lines from various origins: Academia Sinica (AS),
City-University of Hong-Kong (CITYU), Microsoft
Research (MSR) and Peking University (PKU).
1Jin (2007) uses self-training with MDL to address this issue.
Evaluating unsupervized systems is a challenge by
itself. As an agreement on the exact definition of
what a word is remains hard to reach, various seg-
mentation guidelines have been proposed and fol-
lowed for the annotation of different corpora. The
evaluation of supervized systems can be achieved on
any corpus using any guidelines: when trained on
data that follows particular guidelines, the resulting
system will follow as well as possible these guide-
lines, and can be evaluated on data annotated accord-
ingly. However, for unsupervized systems, there is
no reason why a system should be closer to one ref-
erence than another or even not to lie somewhere
in between the different existing guidelines. Huang
and Zhao (2007) propose to use cross-training of a
supervized segmentation system in order to have an
estimation of the consistency between different seg-
mentation guidelines, and therefore an upper bound
of what can be expected from an unsupervized sys-
tem (Zhao and Kit, 2008). The average consistency
is found to be as low as 0.85 (f-score). Therefore
this figure can be considered as a sensible topline for
unsupervized systems. The standard baseline which
consists in segmenting each character leads to a base-
line around 0.35 (f-score) ? almost half of the to-
kens in a manually segmented corpus are unigrams.
Per word-length evaluation is also important as
units of various lengths tend to have different distri-
butions. We used ZPAR (Zhang and Clark, 2010) on
the four corpora from the Second Bakeoff to repro-
duce Huang and Zhao's (2007) experiments, but also
to measure cross-corpus consistency at a per-word-
length level. Our overall results are comparable to
what Huang and Zhao (2007) report. However, the
consistency is quickly falling for longer words: on
unigrams, f-scores range from 0.81 to 0.90 (the same
as the overall results). We get slightly higher figures
on bigrams (0.85?0.92) but much lower on trigrams
with only 0.59?0.79. In a segmented Chinese text,
most of the tokens are uni- and bigrams but most of
the types are bi- and trigrams (as unigrams are often
high frequency grammatical words and trigrams the
result of more or less productive affixations). There-
fore the results of evaluations only based on tokens
do not suffer much from poor performances on tri-
grams even if a large part of the lexicon may be in-
correctly processed.
Another issue about the evaluation and compari-
son of unsupervized systems is to try and remain fair
384
in terms of preprocessing and prior knowledge given
to the systems. For example, Wang et al (2011)
used different levels of preprocessing (which they
call ?settings?). In their settings 1 and 2, Wang et
al. (2011) try not to rely on punctuation and char-
acter encoding information (such as distinguishing
Latin and Chinese characters). However, they opti-
mize their parameter for each setting. We therefore
consider that their system does take into account the
level of processing which is performed on Latin char-
acters and Arabic numbers, and therefore ?knows?
whether to expect such characters or not. In set-
ting 3 they add the knowledge of punctuation as clear
boundaries and in setting 4 they preprocess Arabic
and Latin and obtain better, more consistent and less
questionable results.
As we are more interested in reducing the amount
of human labor needed than in achieving by all
means fully unsupervized learning, we do not re-
frain from performing basic and straightforward pre-
processing such as detection of punctuation marks,
Latin characters and Arabic numbers.2 Therefore,
our experiments rely on settings similar to their set-
tings 3 and 4, and are evaluated against the same
corpora.
4 Normalized Variation of Branching
Entropy (nVBE)
Our system builds upon Harris's (1955) hypothesis
and its reformulation by Kempe (1999) and Tanaka-
Ishii (2005). Let us now define formally the notions
underlying our system.
Given an n-gram x0..n = x0..1 x1..2 . . . xn?1..n
with a left context ??, we define its Right Branching
Entropy (RBE) as:
h?(x0..n) = H(?? | x0..n)
= ?
?
x???
P (x | x0..n) logP (x | x0..n).
The Left Branching Entropy (LBE) is defined in a
symmetric way: if we note ?? the right context of
x0..n, its LBE is defined as:
h?(x0..n) = H(?? | x0..n).
The RBE (resp. LBE) can be considered as x0..n's
Branching Entropy (BE) when reading from left to
right (resp. right to left).
2Simple regular expressions could also be considered to deal
with unambiguous cases of numbers and dates in Chinese script.
From h?(x0..n) and h?(x0..n?1) on the one hand,
and from h?(x0..n) and h?(x1..n) we estimate the
Variation of Branching Entropy (VBE) in both direc-
tions, defined as follows:
?h?(x0..n) = h?(x0..n) ? h?(x0..n?1)
?h?(x0..n) = h?(x0..n) ? h?(x1..n).
The VBEs are not directly comparable for strings
of different lengths and need to be normalized. In
this work, we recenter them around 0 with respect to
the length of the string by substracting the mean of
the VBEs of the strings of the same length. Writing
??h?(x) and ??h?(x). The normalized VBEs for the
string x, or nVBEs, are then defined as follow (we
only defined ??h?(x) for clarity reasons): for each
length k and each k-gram x such that len(x) = k,
??h?(x) = ?h?(x)???,k, where ??,k is the mean
of the values of ?h?(x) of all k-grams x.
Note that we use and normalize the variation of
branching entropy and not the branching entropy it-
self. Doing so would break the Harris's hypothesis as
we would not expect h?(x0..n) < h?(x0..n?1) in non-
boundary situation anymore. Many studies use di-
rectly the branching entropy (normalized or not) and
report results that are below state-of-the-art systems
(Cohen et al, 2002).
5 Decoding algorithm
If we follow Harris's hypothesis and consider com-
plex morphological word structures, we expect a
large VBE at the boundaries of interesting units and
more unstable variations inside ?words.? This expec-
tation was confirmed by empirical data visualization.
For different lengths of n-grams, we compared the
distributions of the VBEs at different positions inside
the n-gram and at its boundaries. By plotting density
distributions for words vs. non-words, we observed
that the VBE at both boundaries were the most dis-
criminative value. Therefore, we decided to take in
account the VBE only at the word-candidate bound-
aries (left and right) and not to consider the inner val-
ues. Two interesting consequences of this decision
are: first, all ??h(x) can be precomputed as they do
not depend on the context. Second, best segmenta-
tion can be computed using dynamic programming.
Since we consider the VBE only at words bound-
ary, we can define for any n-gram w its autonomy as
a(x) = ???h(x) + ??h?(x). The more an n-gram is
autonomous, the more likely it is to be a word.
385
With this measure, we can redefine the sentence
segmentation problem as the maximization of the au-
tonomy measure of its words. For a character se-
quence s, if we call Seg(s) the set of all the possible
segmentations, then we are looking for:
arg max
W?Seg(s)
?
wi?W
a(wi) ? len(wi),
where W is the segmentation corresponding to the
sequence of words w0w1 . . . wm, and len(wi) is the
length of a word wi used here to be able to com-
pare segmentations resulting in a different number
of words. This best segmentation can be computed
easily using dynamic programming.
6 Results and discussion
We tested our system against the data from the 4 cor-
pora of the Second Bakeoff, in both settings 3 and 4,
as described in Section 3. Overall results are given
in Table 1 and per-word-length results in Table 2.
Our results (nVBE) show significant improve-
ments over Jin's (2006) strategy (VBE > 0) and
are closely competing with ESA. But contrarily to
ESA (Wang et al, 2011), it does not require multi-
ple iterations on the corpus and it does not rely on
any parameters. This shows that we can rely solely
on a separation measure and get high segmentation
scores. When maximized over a sentence, this mea-
sure captures at least in part what can be modeled by
a cohesion measure without the need for fine-tuning
the balance between the two.
The evolution of the results w.r.t. word length is
consistent with the supervized cross-evaluation re-
sults of the various segmentation guidelines as per-
formed in Section 3.
Due to space constraints, we cannot detail here a
qualitative analysis of the results. We can simply
mention that the errors we observed are consistent
with previous systems based on Harris's hypothesis
(see (Magistry and Sagot, 2011) and Jin (2007) for a
longer discussion). Many errors are related to dates
and Chinese numbers. This could and should be
dealt with during preprocessing. Other errors often
involve frequent grammatical morphemes or produc-
tive affixes. These errors are often interesting for lin-
guists and could be studied as such and/or corrected
in a post-processing stage that would introduce lin-
guistic knowledge. Indeed, unlike content words,
grammatical morphemes belongs to closed classes,

proposal, based on normalized VBE with maximization at
word boundaries. Recall that the topline is around 0.85

nVBE algorithm and setting 4. Recall that the toplines
are respectively 0.85, 0.81, 0.85 and 0.59 (see Section 3)
therefore introducing this linguistic knowledge into
the system may be of great help without requiring
to much human effort. A sensible way to go in that
direction would be to let unsupervized system deal
with open classes and process closed classes with a
symbolic or supervized module.
One can also observe that our system performs bet-
ter on PKU and MSR corpora. As PKU is the small-
est corpus and AS the biggest, size alone cannot ex-
plain this result. However, PKU is more consistent
in genre as it contains only articles from the Peo-
ple's Daily. On the other end, AS is a balanced cor-
pus with a greater variety in many aspects. CITYU
Corpus is almost as small as PKU but contains arti-
cles from newspapers of various Mandarin Chinese
speaking communities where great variation is to be
expected. This suggest that consistency of the input
data is as important as the amount of data. This hy-
pothesis has to be confirmed in futur studies. If it is,
automatic clustering of the input data may be an im-
portant pre-processing step for this kind of systems.
