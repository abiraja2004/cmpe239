Abstract 
The language of classical propositional iog- 
Ic is extended by functorial variables as a 
new syntactical category. Functorial vari- 
ables render to be a possible integrating 
representation of both assertion and presup- 
position in one and the same logical formula 
different from such using classical conjunc- 
tion. 
O~ Introduction 
From a computational point of vlew there 
is an important difficulty of an adequate 
formalization of both assertion and presup- 
position, It rests on dividing utterances 
into an explicit part (assertion) and an im- 
plicit one (presupposition). 
Frege 118921 refused any explication of 
this implicit part, because of hls ideallza= 
t/on that logic deals only with correct 
~tatemerlts. At least in regard of  definite 
descriptions Russell /1905/ pleaded for such 
an explication. But classical conjunction 
was one of its essential formal tools. To a 
certain extent assertion and presuppoeltion 
were represented at one and the same level. 
Strawson /1950/  c la imed that  p resuppos i t ions  
have to be exp l i ca ted ,  but  not  a t  the same 
leve l  l i ke  the imp l i c i t  par t .  Many l ingu is ts  
= e, g. Klefer 11973/ - believe that logical 
means can be used to represent both parts of 
utterances aeparately~ but these representa- 
tions cannot be put together in one and the 
same logical expreeslon~ because Russell's 
solution Is unsatisfactory. 
My in tent ion  i s  to  show that  functor la l  
var iab les  render  to  be poss ib le  too ls  fo r  
in tegrat ing  representat ion  o f  both  asser t ion  
and presuppos i t ion  in  one and the same log i -  
ca l  fo rmula ,  Moreover  - un l i ke  Bergmann 
i1981/ ,  OunglKOstner /19861 - this represen- 
tation Is a svntactlcal one and different 
from that given by means of classical con- 
Junction (cp, Max l1986/i /forthcoming/).

1.2, Functorlal variables 
I introduce functorial variables as e ne~ 
pyntactlcal category, and take the classical 
functors as values of these variables. Intro- 
ducing such variables we get a whole class of 
syntactical extensions of the classical pro- 
positional logic. Only functorlal varlablee 
of the following form are considered= 
G~=gi_ I ~ f,g ~ 16. 
The f's and g's are called components. The 
f-component (g-component) is called first 
(second) component. 
are values of 2 Semantically, ~ and ~gG2 the 
functorial variables f,g. Therefore these 
functorlal variables (abbreviation= FV's) 
represent eats of functors wlth exact two 
(not necessarily different) elements. Wlth 
respect  to  an in tu i t i ve  in terpretat ion  FV'e

3, Assertion and presupposition 
The introduction of expressions of the form 
G~,6Plq i _  renders to be a possible unconven- 
tional approach to assertion and presupposi- 
tion. I postulate that the p-propositional 
variables represent elsments of a set of as- 
sertions, and the corresponding q-variables 
represent elements of a set of presupposi- 
tions. The FV G 2 4,6 constitutes an ordered 
sequence of both sorts of propositional va- 
t l a~s-  : -~  p re eu ppo sl t ion component 
!p iq~ i presupposltion expression: ~2plql 
G2, (~P lq l  ~--- ql ) 
I L- J - J - -~asser t lon  expression : ~2plql --assertion component (~2p iq i~ pi ) 
Concerning logical relations between several 
sentences both assertions and presupposi- 
tions can influence this relation. In order 
to form s correct translation of such com- 
pound sentences their simple parts should be 
translated into expressions of the form 
G 2 . Let A G be a G-formula of G. Then 4,6Piql 
we can put on the following generalization 
of our interpretation: 
A GEl .- assertion expression 
A GE2 - presupposition expression. 
So ws get a new syntactical method to expli- 
cate assertion and presupposition in one and 
the same formula. Unlike 4-valued/2-dimen- 
sional approaches our language possesses an 
enrlchment of syntactical expressive power. 
4. FV's and functors 
The explication of both assertion and pre- 
supposition by  means of formulas of the form 
(plql) dlffers from that one by means of 
claselcal conjunction, because 
(Plql)--- (Pi Aq l  ) is not valid. 
Because of 
T I :  (P i  A q l )  ~(P lq l ) ,  end 
T2: (p lq l )~(p l  V q l )  
the representat ion  by means of G 2 i s  4,6  
st ronger  than that  one by conjunct ion,  but 
i t  i s  weaker than that one by d i s junct ion .  
5. Negations 
Because of 
2 
T3= G l l , l l (p lq l ) (p lq l )~ r-~q 1 
410 
the 2-placed FV G 2 - 11,11 can be interpreted ee  
presupposition-rejecting negation. 
G 2 13,6 can be interpreted as Presuppoeitlon- 
~resefving negation, because
