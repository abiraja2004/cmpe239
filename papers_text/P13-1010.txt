Abstract
We propose a computationally efficient
graph-based approach for local coherence
modeling. We evaluate our system on
three tasks: sentence ordering, summary
coherence rating and readability assess-
ment. The performance is comparable to
entity grid based approaches though these
rely on a computationally expensive train-
ing phase and face data sparsity problems.
1 Introduction
Many NLP applications which process or gener-
ate texts rely on information about local coher-
ence, i.e. information about which entities occur
in which sentence and how the entities are dis-
tributed in the text. This led to the development
of many theories and models accounting for lo-
cal coherence. One popular model, the center-
ing model (Grosz et al, 1995), uses a ranking of
discourse entities realized in particular sentences
and computes transitions between adjacent sen-
tences to provide insight in the felicity of texts.
Centering models local coherence rather generally
and has been applied to the generation of refer-
ring expressions (Kibble and Power, 2004), to re-
solve pronouns (Brennan et al, 1987, inter alia),
to score essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), to
arrange sentences in the correct order (Karamanis
et al, 2009), and to many other tasks. Poesio et
al. (2004) observe that it is not clear how to set
parameters in the centering model so that optimal
performance in different tasks and languages can
be achieved. Barzilay and Lapata (2008) criticize
research on centering to be too dependent on man-
ually annotated input. This led them to propose a
local coherence model relying on a more parsimo-
nious representation, the entity grid model.
The entity grid is a two dimensional array where
the rows represent sentences and the columns dis-
course entities. From this grid Barzilay and La-
pata (2008) derive probabilities of transitions be-
tween adjacent sentences which are used as fea-
tures for machine learning algorithms. They eval-
uate this approach successfully on sentence order-
ing, summary coherence rating, and readability as-
sessment. However, their approach has some dis-
advantages which they point out themselves: data
sparsity, domain dependence and computational
complexity, especially in terms of feature space is-
sues while building their model (Barzilay and La-
pata (2008, p.8, p.10, p.30), Elsner and Charniak
(2011, p.126, p.127)).
In order to overcome these problems we pro-
pose to represent entities in a graph and then
model local coherence by applying centrality mea-
sures to the nodes in the graph (Section 3). We
claim that a graph is a more powerful representa-
tion for local coherence than the entity grid (Barzi-
lay and Lapata, 2008) which is restricted to transi-
tions between adjacent sentences. The graph can
easily span the entire text without leading to com-
putational complexity and data sparsity problems.
Similar to the application of graph-based methods
in other areas of NLP (e.g. work on word sense
disambiguation by Navigli and Lapata (2010); for
an overview over graph-based methods in NLP
see Mihalcea and Radev (2011)) we model local
coherence by relying only on centrality measures
applied to the nodes in the graph. We apply our
graph-based model to the three tasks handled by
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) to show that it pro-
vides the same flexibility over disparate tasks as
the entity grid model: sentence ordering (Section
4.1), summary coherence ranking (Section 4.2),
and readability assessment (Section 4.3). In the

experiments sections, we discuss the impact of
genre and stylistic properties of documents on the
local coherence computation. We also show that,
though we do not need a computationally expen-
sive learning phase, our model achieves state-of-
the-art performance. From this we conclude that a
graph is an alternative to the entity grid model: it is
computationally more tractable for modeling local
coherence and does not suffer from data sparsity
problems (Section 5).
2 The Entity Grid Model
Barzilay and Lapata (2005; 2008) introduced the
entity grid, a method for local coherence modeling
that captures the distribution of discourse entities
across sentences in a text.
An entity grid is a two dimensional array, where
rows correspond to sentences and columns to dis-
course entities. For each discourse entity ej and
each sentence si in the text, the corresponding grid
cell cij contains information about the presence or
absence of the entity in the sentence. If the entity
does not appear in the sentence, the correspond-
ing grid cell contains an absence marker ???. If
the entity is present in the sentence, the cell con-
tains a representation of the entity?s syntactic role:
?S? if the entity is a subject, ?O? if it is an object
and ?X? for all other syntactic roles (cf. Table 2).
When a noun is attested more than once with a
different grammatical role in the same sentence,
the role with the highest grammatical ranking is
chosen to represent the entity (a subject is ranked
higher than an object, which is ranked higher than
other syntactic roles).
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) capture local coher-
ence by means of local entity transitions, i.e. se-
quences of grid cells (c1j . . . cij . . . cnj) represent-
ing the syntactic function or absence of an entity in
adjacent sentences1. The coherence of a sentence
in relation to its local context is determined by the
1For complexity reasons, Barzilay and Lapata consider
only transitions between at most three sentences.

Table 2: Entity Grid representation of summary M
local entity transitions of the entities present or ab-
sent in the sentence. To make this representation
accessible to machine learning algorithms, Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008) compute for each document
the probability of each transition and generate fea-
ture vectors representing the sentences. Coherence
assessment is then formulated as a ranking learn-
ing problem where the ranking function is learned
with SVMlight (Joachims, 2002).
The entity grid approach has already been ap-
plied to many applications relying on local co-
herence estimation: summary rating (Barzilay
and Lapata, 2005), essay scoring (Burstein et al,
2010) or story generation (McIntyre and Lapata,
2010). It was also used successfully in com-
bination with other systems or features. Sori-
cut and Marcu (2006) show that the entity grid
model is a critical component in their sentence or-
dering model for discourse generation. Barzilay
and Lapata (2008) combine the entity grid with
readability-related features to discriminate docu-
ments between easy- and difficult-to-read cate-
gories. Lin et al (2011) use discourse relations to
transform the entity grid representation into a dis-
course role matrix that is used to generate feature
vectors for machine learning algorithms similarly
to Barzilay and Lapata (2008).
Several studies propose to extend the entity grid
model using different strategies for entity selec-
tion. Filippova and Strube (2007) aim to improve
the entity grid model performance by grouping en-
tities by means of semantic relatedness. In their
studies, Elsner and Charniak extend the number
and type of entities selected and consider that each
entity has to be dealt with accordingly with its in-
formation status (Elsner et al, 2007) or its named-
entity category (Elsner and Charniak, 2011). Fi-
nally, they include a heuristic coreference resolu-
tion component by linking mentions which share a

head noun. These extensions led to the best results
reported so far for the sentence ordering task.
3 Method
Our model is based on the insight that the en-
tity grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) corresponds
to the incidence matrix of a bipartite graph rep-
resenting the text (see Newman (2010) for more
details on graph representation). A fundamental
assumption underlying our model is that this bi-
partite graph contains the entity transition infor-
mation needed for local coherence computation,
rendering feature vectors and learning phase un-
necessary. The bipartite graph G = (Vs, Ve, L, w)
is defined by two independent sets of nodes ? that
correspond to the set of sentences Vs and the set of
entities Ve of the text ? and a set of edges L associ-
ated with weights w. An edge between a sentence
node si and an entity node ej is created in the bi-
partite graph if the corresponding cell cij in the
entity grid is not equal to ???. Each edge is asso-
ciated with a weight w(ej , si) that depends on the
grammatical role of the entity ej in the sentence
si2. In contrast to Barzilay and Lapata?s entity
grid that contains information about absent enti-
ties, our graph-based representation only contains
?positive? information. Figure 1(a) shows an ex-
ample of the bipartite graph that corresponds to the
grid in Table 2. The incidence matrix of this graph
(Figure 1(d)) is very similar to the entity grid.
2The assignment of weights is described in Section 4.
By modeling entity transitions, Barzilay and
Lapata rely on links that exist between sentences
to model local coherence. In the same spirit, we
apply different kinds of one-mode projections to
the sentence node set Vs of the bipartite graph to
represent the connections that exist between ? po-
tentially non adjacent ? sentences in the graph.
These projections result in graphs where nodes
correspond to sentences. An edge is created be-
tween two nodes if the corresponding sentences
have a least one entity in common. Contrary to the
bipartite graph, one-mode projections are directed
as they follow the text order. Therefore, in projec-
tion graphs an edge can exist between the first and
the second sentence while the inverse is not pos-
sible. In our model, we define three kinds of pro-
jection graphs, PU , PW and PAcc, depending on
the weighting scheme associated with their edges.
In PU , weights are binary and equal 1 when two
sentences have a least one entity in common (Fig-
ure 1(b)). In PW , edges are weighted according to
the number of entities ?shared? by two sentences
(Figure 1(c)). In PAcc syntactic information is ac-
counted for by integrating the edge weights in the
bipartite graph. In this case, weights are equal to
Wik =
?
e?Eik
w(e, si) ? w(e, sk) ,
where Eik is the set of entities shared by si and
sk. Distance between sentences si and sk can also
be integrated in the weight of one-mode projec-
tions to decrease the importance of links that ex-
95
ists between non adjacent sentences. In this case,
the weights of the projection graphs are divided by
k ? i.
From this graph-based representation, the local
coherence of a text T can be measured by comput-
ing the average outdegree of a projection graph P .
This centrality measure was chosen for two main
reasons. First, it allows us to evaluate to which ex-
tent a sentence is connected, in terms of discourse
entities, with the other sentences of the text. Sec-
ond, compared to other centrality measures, the
computational complexity of the average outde-
gree is low (O(N?(N?1)2 ) for a document com-
posed by N sentences), keeping the local coher-
ence estimation feasible on large documents and
on large corpora. Formally, the local coherence of
a text T is equal to
LocalCoherence(T ) = AvgOutDegree(P )
= 1N
?
i=1..N
OutDegree(si) ,
where OutDegree(si) is the sum of the weights as-
sociated to edges that leave si and N is the num-
ber of sentences in the text. This value can also be
seen as the sum of the values of the adjacency ma-
trix of the projection graph (Figures 1(e) and 1(f))
divided by the number of sentences.
4 Experiments
We compare our model with the entity grid ap-
proach and evaluate the influence of the different
weighting schemes used in the projection graphs,
either PW or PAcc, where weights are potentially
decreased by distance information Dist. Our
baseline corresponds to local coherence computa-
tion based on the unweighted projection graph PU .
For graph construction, all nouns in a document
are considered as discourse entities, even those
which do not head NPs as this is beneficial for
the entity grid model as described in Elsner and
Charniak (2011). We also propose to use a coref-
erence resolution system and consider coreferent
entities to be the same discourse entity. To do so,
we use one of the top performing systems from the
CoNLL 2012 shared task (Martschat et al, 2012).
As the coreference resolution system is trained on
well-formed textual documents and expects a cor-
rect sentence ordering, we use in all our experi-
ments only features that do not rely on sentence
order (e.g. alias relations, string matching, etc.).
Grammatical information associated with each
entity is extracted automatically thanks to the
Stanford parser using dependency conversion (de
Marneffe et al, 2006). Syntactic weights in the
bipartite graph are defined following the linguistic
intuition that subjects are more important than ob-
jects, which are themselves more important than
other syntactic roles. Preliminary experiments
show that as long as weight assignment follows
the scheme S > O > X, then more coherent docu-
ments are associated with a higher local coherence
value than less coherent document in 90% of cases
(while this value equals 49% when no restric-
tion is given on syntactic weights order). More-
over, as the local coherence computation is a lin-
ear combination of the syntactic weights, the func-
tion is smooth and no large variations of the local
coherence values are observed for small changes
of weights? values. For these reasons, weights
w(e, si) are set as follows: 3 if e is subject in si, 2
if e is an object and 1 otherwise.
We evaluate the ability of our graph-based
model to estimate the local coherence of a tex-
tual document with three different experiments.
First, we perfom a sentence ordering task (Sec-
tion 4.1) as proposed in Barzilay and Lapata
(2008). Then, as the first task uses ?artificial? doc-
uments, we also work on two other tasks that in-
volve ?real? documents: summary coherence rat-
ing (Section 4.2), and readability assessment (Sec-
tion 4.3). In these experiments, distance compu-
tation and syntactic weights are the same for all
tasks and all corpora. However, the model is also
flexible and can be adaptated to the different tasks
by optimizing the parameters on a development
data set, which may give better results.
4.1 Sentence Ordering
The first experiment consists in ranking alternative
sentence orderings of a document, as proposed by
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) and Elsner and Char-
niak (2011).
4.1.1 Experimental Settings
The sentence ordering task can be performed in
two ways: discrimination and insertion. Discrimi-
nation consists in comparing a document to a ran-
dom permutation of its sentences. For this, our
system associates local coherence values with the
original document and its permutation, the output
of our system being considered as correct if the
score for the original document is higher than the
96
score of its permutation. In the insertion task, pro-
posed by Elsner and Charniak (2011), we evaluate
the ability of our system to retrieve the original
position of a sentence previously removed from a
document. For this, each sentence is removed in
turn and a local coherence score is computed for
every possible reinsertion position. The system
output is considered as correct if the document as-
sociated with the highest local coherence score is
the one in which the sentence is reinserted in the
correct position.
These two tasks were performed on docu-
ments extracted from the English test part of the
CoNLL 2012 shared task (Pradhan et al, 2012).
This corpus, composed by documents of multiple
news sources ? spoken or written ? was preferred
to the ACCIDENTS and EARTHQUAKES corpora
used by Barzilay and Lapata (2008) for two rea-
sons. First, as mentioned by Elsner and Charniak
(2008), these corpora use a very constrained style
and are not typical of normal informative docu-
ments3. Second, we want to evaluate the influence
of automatically performed coreference resolution
in a controlled fashion. The coreference resolution
system used performs well on the CoNLL 2012
data. In this dataset, documents composed by the
concatenation of differents news articles or too
short to have at least 20 permutations were dis-
carded from the corpus. This filtering results in 61
documents composed of 36.1 sentences or 2064
word tokens on average. In both discrimination
and insertion, we compare our system against a
random baseline where random values are associ-
ated with the different orderings.
4.1.2 Discrimination
Accuracy is used to evaluate the ability of our sys-
tem to discriminate a document from 20 differ-
ent permutations. It equals the number of times
our system gives the highest score to the original
document, divided by the number of comparisons.
Since the model can give the same score for a per-
mutation and the original document, we also com-
pute F-measure where recall is correct/total and
precision equals correct/decisions. We test sig-
nificance using the Student?s t-test that can detect
significant differences between paired samples.
Moreover, as increasing the number of hypotheses
3Our graph-based model obtains for the discrimination
task an accuracy of 0.846 and 0.635 on the ACCIDENTS and
EARTHQUAKES datasets, respectively, compared to 0.904 and
0.872 as reported by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).

(B&L: Barzilay and Lapata (2008); E&C Elsner
and Charniak (2011)) vs. graph-based
in a test can also increase the likelihood of wit-
nessing a rare event, and therefore, the chance to
reject the null hypothesis when it is true, we use
the Bonferroni correction to adjust the increased
random likelihood of apparent significance.
Table 3 presents the values obtained by three
baseline systems when applied to our corpus. Re-
sults for the entity grid models described by Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008) and Elsner and Charniak
(2011) are obtained by using Micha Elsner?s reim-
plementation in the Brown Coherence Toolkit4.
The system was trained on the English training
part of the CoNLL 2012 shared task filtered in the
same way as the test part.
Table 3 also displays the results for our model.
These values show that our system performs com-
parable to the state-of-the-art. Indeed, the differ-
ence between our best results and those of Elsner
and Charniak are not statistically significant.
In this experiment, distance information is criti-
cal. Without it, it is not possible to distinguish be-
tween an original document and one of its permu-
tation as both contain the same number and kind
of entities. Distance however can detect changes
in the distribution of entities within the document
as space between entities is significantly modi-
fied when sentence order is permuted. When the
number of entities ?shared? by two sentences is
taken into account (PW ), the accuracy of our sys-
tem grows (from 0.830 to 0.871). Table 3 finally
shows that syntactic information improves the per-
formance of our system (yet not significantly) and
gives the best results (PAcc).
We also evaluated the influence of coreference
resolution on the performance of our system. Us-

ing coreference resolution improves the perfor-
mance of the system when distance information is
used alone in the system (Table 3). However, this
improvement is not statistically significant.
4.1.3 Insertion
Sentence insertion is much more difficult than dis-
crimination for two reasons. First, in insertion,
permutations only differ by one sentence. Second,
a document is compared to many more permuta-
tions in insertion task than in discrimination.
In complement to accuracy, we use the insertion
score introduced by Elsner and Charniak (2011)
for evaluation. This score ? the higher, the better
? computes the proximity between the initial and
the proposed position of a sentence, averaged by
the number of sentences.
Table 4 shows that, as expected, results for this
task are much lower than those obtained for dis-
crimination. However they are still comparable
with the results of Elsner and Charniak (2011)5.
As previously and for the same reasons, dis-
tance information is critical for this task. The best
results, that present a statistically significant im-
provement when compared to the random base-
line, are obtained when distance information and
the number of entities ?shared? by two sentences
are taken into account (PW ). We can see that the
accuracy value obtained with our system is higher
than the one provided with the entity grid model.
However, the entity grid model reaches a signifi-
cantly higher insertion score. This means that, if it
makes more mistakes than our system, the position
chosen by the entity grid model is usually closer
to the correct position. Finally, contrary to the
discrimination task, syntactic information (PAcc)
does not improve the performance of our system.
5Their results are slightly lower than those presented in
their paper, probably because our corpus is composed by doc-
uments that can be longer than the ones used in their experi-
ments (Wall Street Journal articles).
When the coreference resolution system is used,
the best accuracy value decreases while the inser-
tion score increases from 0.114 to 0.138 (Table 4).
Therefore, coreference resolution tends to asso-
ciate positions that are closer to the original ones.
4.2 Summary Coherence Rating
To reconfirm the hypothesis that our model can es-
timate the local coherence of a textual document,
we perform a second experiment, summary co-
herence rating. To this end, we apply our model
on the corpus used and proposed by Barzilay and
Lapata (2008). As the objective of our model is
to estimate the coherence of a summary, we pre-
fer this dataset to other summarization evaluation
task corpora, as these account for other dimen-
sions of the summaries: content selection, fluency,
etc. Starting with a pair of summaries, one slightly
more coherent than the other, the objective of the
task is to order the two summaries according to
local coherence.
4.2.1 Experimental Settings
For the summary coherence rating experiment,
pairs to be ordered are composed of summaries
extracted from the Document Understanding Con-
ference (DUC 2003). Summaries, provided either
by humans or by automatic systems, were judged
by seven humans annotators and associated with
a coherence score (for more details on this score
see Barzilay and Lapata (2008)). 80 pairs were
then created, each of these being composed by two
summaries of a same document where the score
of one of the summaries is significantly higher
than the score of the second one. Even though all
summaries are of approximately the same length
(114.2 words on average), their sentence length
can vary considerably. Indeed, more coherent
summaries tend to have more sentences and con-
tain less entities.
For evaluation purposes, the accuracy still cor-
responds to the number of correct ratings di-
vided by the number of comparisons, while the F-
measure combines recall and precision measures.
As before, significance is tested with the Student?s
t-test accounting for the Bonferroni correction.
4.2.2 Results

and Lapata (2008) on the exact same corpus with

Table 5: Summary Coherence Rating, reported re-
sults from Barzilay and Lapata (2008) vs. graph-
based
our system gives results comparable to those ob-
tained by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).
This table also shows that, contrary to sentence
ordering task, accounting for the distance between
two sentences (Dist) tends to decrease the results.
This difference is explained by the fact that a man-
ual summary, usually considered as more coher-
ent by humans annotators, tends to contain more
(and shorter) sentences than an automatic one. As
adding distance information decreases the value of
our local coherence score, our graph-based model
gives better results without it.
Moreover, in contrast to the first experiment,
when accounting for the number of entities
?shared? by two sentences (PW ), values of accu-
racy and F-measure are lower. We explain this
behaviour by the number of sentences contained
in the less coherent documents. Indeed, they are
composed by a smaller number of sentences but
contain more entities on average. This means that,
in these documents, two sentences tend to share
a larger number of entities and therefore have a
higher local coherence score when the PW projec-
tion graph is used.
When combined with distance information,
syntactic information still improves the results
(PAcc), though not significantly, but does not lead
to the best results for this task.
Finally, Table 5 also shows that using a coref-
erence resolution system for document represen-
tation does not improve the performance of our
system. We believe that, as mentioned by Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008), this degradation is related
to the fact that automatic summarization systems
do not use anaphoric expressions which makes the
coreference resolution system useless in this case.
With our graph-based model, the best results are
obtained by the baseline (PU ), and experiments
show that adding information about distance or
syntax does not help in this context. It seems
therefore necessary to integrate information that is
more appropriate to summaries. Although making
the model more appropriate for a specific task is
out of the scope of this paper, our model is flex-
ible and accounting for information about genre
differences or sentence length, by adding weights
in the graph-based representation of the document,
is feasible without any modification of the model.
4.3 Readability Assessment
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) argue that grid models
are domain and style dependent. Therefore they
proposed a readability assessment task to test if the
entity grid model can be used for style classifica-
tion. They combined their model with Schwarm
and Ostendorf?s (2005) readability features and
use Support Vector Machines to classify docu-
ments in two categories. With the same intention,
we evaluate the ability of our model to differenti-
ate ?easy to read? documents from difficult ones.
4.3.1 Experimental Settings
The objective of the readability assessment task
is to evaluate how difficult to read a document is.
We perform this task on the data used by Barzilay
and Lapata (2008), a corpus collected originally
by Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) from the Ency-
clopedia Britannica and its version for children,
the Britannica Elementary. Both versions contain
107 articles. In Encyclopedia Britannica, docu-
ments are composed by an average of 83.1 sen-
tences while they contain 36.6 sentences in Bri-
tannica Elementary. Although these texts are not
explicitly annotated with grade levels, they repre-
sent two broad readability categories.
In order to estimate the complexity of a doc-
ument, our model computes the local coherence
score for each article in the two categories. The
article associated with the higher score is consid-
ered to be the more readable as it is more coherent,
needing less interpretation from the reader than a
document associated with a lower local coherence
score. Values presented in the following section
correspond to accuracy, where the system is cor-
rect if it assigns the higher local coherence score to
the most ?easy to read? document, and F-measure.

lay and Lapata (2008) vs. graph-based (S&O:

4.3.2 Results
In order to compare our results with those reported
by Barzilay and Lapata (2008), entities used for
the graph-based representation are discourse enti-
ties that head NPs.
Table 6 shows that, for this task, syntactic in-
formation plays a dominant role (PAcc). A sta-
tistically significant improvement is provided by
including syntactic information. It gives more
weight to subject entities that are more numerous
in the Britannica Elementary documents which
are composed by simpler and shorter sentences.
Finally, when distance is accounted for together
with syntactic information, the accuracy is signif-
icantly improved (p < 0.01) with regard to the re-
sults obtained with syntactic information only.
Table 6 also shows that when the number of en-
tities ?shared? by two sentences is accounted for
(PW ), the results are lower. Indeed, Encyclope-
dia Britannica documents are composed by longer
sentences, that contain a higher number of enti-
ties. This increases the local coherence value of
difficult documents more than the value of ?easy
to read? documents, that contain less entities.
When our graph-based representation used the
coreference resolution system, unlike the observa-
tion of Barzilay and Lapata (2008), the results of
our model decrease significantly. The poor perfor-
mance of our system in this case can be explained
by the fact that the coreference resolution system
regroups more entities in Encyclopedia Britannica
documents than in Britannica Elementary ones.
Therefore, the number of entities that are ?shared?
by two sentences increases more importantly in
the Encyclopedia Britannica corpus, while the dis-
tance between two occurrences of one entity de-
creases in a more significant manner. For these
reasons, the coherence scores associated with ?dif-
ficult to read? documents tend to be higher when
coreference resolution is performed on our data,
which reduces the performance of our system. As
before, syntactic information leads to the best re-
sults, but does not allow the accuracy to be higher
than random anymore.
Compared to the results provided by Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008) with the entity grid model
alone, our representation outperforms their model
significantly. We believe that this difference is
caused by how syntactic information is introduced
in the document representation and by the fact
that our system can deal with entities that appear
throughout the whole document while the entity
grid model only looks at entities within a three
sentences windows. Our model which captures
exclusively local coherence is almost on par with
the results reported for Schwarm & Ostendorf?s
(2005) system which relies on a wide range of lex-
ical, syntactic and semantic features. Only when
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) combine the entity
grid with Schwarm & Ostendorf?s features they
reach performance considerably better than ours.
In addition to the experiments proposed by
Barzilay and Lapata (2008), we used a third read-
ability category, the Britannica Student, that con-
tains articles targeted for youths (from 11 to 14
years old). These documents, which are quite sim-
ilar to the Encyclopedia Britannica ones, are com-
posed by an average of 44.1 sentences. As we
were only able to find 99 articles out of the 107
original ones in this category, sub corpora of the
three categories were used for the comparison with
the Britannica Student articles.
Table 7 shows the results obtained for the com-
parisons between the two first categories and the
Britannica Student articles. As previously, coref-
erence resolution tends to lower the results, there-
fore only values obtained without coreference res-
olution are reported in the table.
When articles from Britannica Student are com-
pared to articles extracted from Encyclopedia Bri-
tannica, Table 7 shows that the different param-
eters have the same influence as for comparing
between Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica
Elementary: statistically significant improvement
with syntactic information, higher values when
distance is taken into account, etc. However, it

Table 7: Readability, comparison between Ency-
clopedia Britannica, Britannica Elementary and
Britannica Student
can also be seen that accuracy and F-measure are
lower for comparing these two corpora. This is
probably due to the stylistic difference between
these two kinds of articles, which is less signifi-
cant than the difference between articles from En-
cyclopedia Britannica and Britannica Elementary.
Concerning the comparison between Britannica
Student and Britannica Elementary articles, Ta-
ble 7 shows that integrating distance information
gives slightly different results and tends to de-
crease the values of accuracy and F-measure. This
is explained by the fact that Britannica Elementary
documents contain fewer entities than Britannica
Student articles. As the length of the two kinds of
articles is similar, distance between entities in Bri-
tannica Elementary documents is more important.
As a result, accounting for distance information
lowers the local coherence values for the more co-
herent document, which reduces the performance
of our model. As previously, syntactic information
improves the results and, for this comparison, the
best result is obtained when syntactic information
alone is accounted for. This leads to an accuracy
which is almost equal to the one when comparing
Encyclopedia Britannica and Britannica Elemen-
tary (0.707 against 0.766).
These two additional experiments show that our
model is style dependent. It obtains better results
when it has to distinguish between Encyclopedia
Britannica and Britannica Elementary or Britan-
nica Student and Britannica Elementary articles
which present a more important difference from
a stylictic point of view than articles from Ency-
clopedia Britannica and Britannica Elementary.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised and
computationally efficient graph-based local coher-
ence model. Experiments show that our model is
robust among tasks and domains, and reaches rea-
sonable results for three tasks with the same pa-
rameter values and settings (i.e. accuracy values
of 0.889, 0.70 and 0.766 for sentence ordering,
summary coherence rating and readability assess-
ment tasks respectively (PAcc, Dist)). Moreover,
our model can be optimized and obtains results
comparable with entity grid based methods when
proper settings are used for each task.
Our model has two main advantages over the
entity grid model. First, as the graph used for doc-
ument representation contains information about
entity transitions, our model does not need a learn-
ing phase. Second, as it relies only on graph cen-
trality, our model does not suffer from the com-
putational complexity and data sparsity problems
mentioned by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).
Our current model leaves space for improve-
ment. Future work should first investigate the inte-
gration of information about entities. Indeed, our
model only uses entities as indications of sentence
connection although it has been shown that distin-
guishing important from unimportant entities, ac-
cording to their named-entity category, has a pos-
itive impact on local coherence computation (El-
sner and Charniak, 2011). Moreover, future work
should also examine the use of discourse relation
information, as proposed in (Lin et al, 2011). This
can be easily done by adding edges in the projec-
tion graphs when sentences contain entities related
from a discourse point of view while Lin et al?s
approach suffers from complexity and data spar-
sity problems similar to the entity grid model.
Finally, these promising results on local coher-
ence modeling make us believe that our graph-
based representation can be used without much
modification for other tasks, e.g. extractive sum-
marization or topic segmentation. This could be
achieved with link analysis algorithms such as
PageRank, that decide on the importance of a (sen-
tence) node within a graph based on global infor-
mation recursively drawn from the entire graph.
