Abstract
In statistical machine translation, estimat-
ing word-to-word alignment probabilities
for the translation model can be difficult
due to the problem of sparse data: most
words in a given corpus occur at most a
handful of times. With a highly inflected
language such as Czech, this problem can
be particularly severe. In addition, much
of the morphological variation seen in Czech
words is not reflected in either the morphol-
ogy or syntax of a language like English. In
this work, we show that using morphologi-
cal analysis to modify the Czech input can
improve a Czech-English machine transla-
tion system. We investigate several differ-
ent methods of incorporating morphological
information, and show that a system that
combines these methods yields the best re-
sults. Our final system achieves a BLEU
score of .333, as compared to .270 for the
baseline word-to-word system.
1 Introduction
In a statistical machine translation task, the goal is
to find the most probable translation of some foreign
language text f into the desired language e. That is,
the system seeks to maximize P (e|f). Rather than
maximizing P (e|f) directly, the standard noisy chan-
nel approach to translation uses Bayes inversion to
split the problem into two separate parts:
argmax
e
P(e|f) = argmax
e
P(e)P(f |e) (1)
where P (e) is known as the language model and
P (f |e) is known as the translation model. The limit-
ing factor in machine translation is usually the qual-
ity of the translation model, since the monolingual
resources needed for training the language model are
generally more available than the parallel corpora
needed for training the translation model.
Due to the difficulty in obtaining large parallel cor-
pora, sparse data is a serious issue when estimating
the parameters of the translation model. This prob-
lem is compounded when one or both of the lan-
guages involved is a highly inflected language. In this
paper, we present a series of experiments suggesting
that morphological analysis can be used to reduce
data sparseness and increase similarity between lan-
guages, thus improving the quality of machine trans-
lation for highly inflected languages. Our work is on
a language pair in which the input language (Czech)
is highly inflected, and the output language (English)
is not. We discuss in Section 5 how our methods
might be generalized to pairs where both languages
are highly inflected.
The plan of this paper is as follows: In Section
2, we review previous work on using morphologi-
cal analysis for statistical machine translation. In
Section 3, we describe several methods for utilizing
morphological information in a statistical translation
model. Section 4 presents the results of our experi-
ments using these methods. Sections 5 and 6 discuss
the results of our experiments and conclude the pa-
per.
2 Previous Work
Until recently, most machine translation projects in-
volved translating between languages with relatively
little morphological structure. Nevertheless, a few
research projects have investigated the use of mor-
phology to improve translation quality. Niessen and
Ney (2000; 2004) report work on German-English
translation, where they investigate various types
of morphosyntactic restructuring, including merging
German verbs with their detached prefixes, annotat-
ing a handful of frequent ambiguous German words
with POS tags, combining idiomatic multi-word ex-
pressions into single words, and undoing question in-
676
version and do-insertion in both German and En-
glish. In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decom-
pose German words into a hierarchical representa-
tion using lemmas and morphological tags, and use
a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of
representation in the translation model. The results
from these papers indicate that on corpus sizes up
to 60,000 parallel sentences, the restructuring op-
erations yielded a large improvement in translation
quality, but the morphological decomposition pro-
vided only a slight additional benefit. However, since
German is not as morphologically complex as Czech,
we might expect a larger benefit from morphological
analysis in Czech.
Another project utilizing morphological analysis
for statistical machine translation is described by Lee
(2004). Lee?s system for Arabic-English translation
takes as input POS-tagged English and Arabic text,
where the Arabic words have been pre-segmented
into stems and affixes. The system performs an ini-
tial alignment of the Arabic morphemes to the En-
glish words. Based on the consistency of the English
POS tag that each Arabic morpheme aligns to, the
system determines whether to keep that morpheme
as a separate item, merge it back onto the stem,
or delete it altogether. In addition, multiple occur-
rences of the determiner Al within a single Arabic
noun phrase are deleted (i.e. only one occurrence
is allowed). Using a phrase-based translation model,
Lee found that Al-deletion was more helpful than the
rest of the morphological analysis. Also, Al-deletion
helped for training corpora up to 3.3 million sen-
tences, but the other morphological analysis helped
only on the smaller corpus sizes (up to 350,000 paral-
lel sentences). This result is consistent with anecdo-
tal evidence suggesting that morphological analysis
becomes less helpful as corpus sizes increase. How-
ever, since parallel corpora of hundreds of thousands
of sentences or more are often difficult to obtain, it
would still be worthwhile to develop a method for
improving systems trained on smaller corpora.
Previous results on Czech-English machine trans-
lation suggest that morphological analysis may be
quite productive for this highly inflected language
where there is only a small amount of closely trans-
lated material. C?mejrek et al (2003), while not fo-
cusing on the use of morphology, give results indicat-
ing that lemmatization of the Czech input improves
BLEU score relative to baseline. These results sup-
port the earlier findings of Al-Onaizan et al (1999),
who used subjective scoring measures. Al-Onaizan
et al measured translation accuracy not only for
lemmatized input, but for an input form they re-
fer to as Czech?. Czech? is intended to capture many
of the morphological distinctions of English, while
discarding those distinctions that are Czech-specific.
The Czech? input was created by distinguishing the
Czech lemmas for singular and plural nouns, differ-
ent verb tenses, and various inflections on pronouns.
Artificial words were also added automatically in
cases where syntactic information in the Czech parse
trees indicated that articles, pronouns, or preposi-
tions might be expected in English. The transforma-
tion to Czech? provided a small additional increase
in translation quality over basic lemmatization.
The experiments described here are similar to
those performed by Al-Onaizan et al (1999), but
there are several important differences. First, we use
no syntactic analysis of the Czech input. Our intent
is to determine how much can be gained by a purely
morphological approach to translation. Second, we
present some experiments in which we modify the
translation model itself to take advantage of morpho-
logical information, rather than simply transforming
the input. Finally, our use of BLEU scores rather
than subjective measurements allows us to perform
more detailed evaluation. We examine the effects of
each type of morphological information separately.
3 Morphology for MT
Morphological variations in Czech are reflected in
several different ways in English. In some cases, such
as verb past tenses or noun plurals, morphological
distinctions found in Czech are also found in English.
In other instances, English may use function words
to express a meaning that occurs as a morphological
variant in Czech. For example, genitive case marking
can often be translated as of and instrumental case
as by or with. In still other instances, morphologi-
cal distinctions made in Czech are either completely
absent in English (e.g. gender on common nouns)
or are reflected in English syntax (e.g. many case
markings). Handling these correspondences between
morphology and syntax requires analysis above the
lexical level and is therefore beyond the scope of this
paper. However, morphological analysis of the Czech
input can potentially be used to improve the trans-
lation model by exploiting the other types of corre-
spondences we have mentioned.
Before we describe how this can be done, it is im-
portant to clarify the kind of morphological anal-
ysis we assume in our input. Our data comes
from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Tree-
bank (PCEDT) (Hajic?, 1998; C?mejrek et al, 2004),
the Czech portion of which has been fully annotated
with morphological information. Each Czech word in
the corpus is associated with an analysis containing
the word?s lemma and a sequence of morphological

tags. These tags provide values along several mor-
phological dimensions, such as part of speech, gen-
der, number, tense, and negation. There are a total
of 15 dimensions along which words may be charac-
terized, although most words have a number of di-
mensions unspecified. An example sentence from the
Czech corpus is shown in Figure 1.
In what follows, we describe four different ways
that the Czech lemma and tag information can be
used to modify the parameters of the translation
model. The first three of these are similar to the work
of Al-Onaizan et al (1999) and involve transforma-
tions to the input data only. The assumptions un-
derlying the word alignment model P (fj|ei) (where
fj and ei are individual words in an aligned sen-
tence pair) are maintained. The fourth method of
incorporating morphological information is novel and
changes the alignment model itself.
3.1 Lemmas
A very simple way to modify the input data us-
ing morphological information is by replacing each
wordform with its associated lemma (see Figure 2).
Based on previous results (Al-Onaizan et al, 1999;
C?mejrek et al, 2003), we expected that this trans-
formation would lead to an improvement in trans-
lation quality due to reduction of data sparseness.
However, since lemmatization does remove some use-
ful information from the Czech wordforms, we also
tried two alternative lemmatization schemes. First,
we tried lemmatizing only certain parts of speech,
leaving other parts of speech alone. We reasoned
that nouns, verbs, and pronouns all carry inflectional
morphology in English, so by lemmatizing only the
other parts of speech, we might retain some of the
benefits of full lemmatization without losing as much
information. We also tried lemmatizing all parts of
speech except pronouns, which are very common and
therefore should be less affected by sparse data prob-
lems.
As a second alternative to full lemmatization, we
experimented with lemmatizing only the less fre-
quent wordforms in the corpus. This allows the
translation system to use the full wordform infor-
mation from more frequent forms, where sparse data
is less of a problem.
To determine whether knowledge of lemmas was
actually necessary, we compared lemmatization with
word truncation. We truncated each wordform in the
data after a fixed number of characters, as suggested
by Och (1995).
3.2 Pseudowords
As discussed earlier, much of the information en-
coded in Czech morphology is encoded as function
words in English. One way to reintroduce some of
the information lost during Czech lemmatization is
by using some of the morphological tags to add ex-
tra ?words? to the Czech input. In many cases,
these pseudowords will also increase the correspon-
dence of English function words to items in the Czech
input. In our system, each pseudoword encodes a
single morphological tag (feature/value pair), such
as PER 1 (?first person?) or TEN F (?future tense?).
Figure 2 shows a Czech input sentence after gener-
ating pseudowords for the person feature on verbs.
We expected that the class of tags most likely to
be useful as pseudowords would be the person tags,
because Czech is a pro-drop language. Using the
person tags as pseudowords should simulate the ex-
istence of pronouns for the English pronouns to align
to. We also expected that negation (which is ex-
pressed on verbs in Czech) would be a useful pseu-
doword, and that case markings might also be helpful
since they sometimes correspond to prepositions in
English, such as of, with, or to.
3.3 Modified Lemmas
In some cases, such as the past tense, Czech mor-
phology is likely to correspond not to a function
word in English, but rather to English inflectional
morphology. In order to capture this kind of phe-
nomenon, we experimented with concatenating the
Czech morphological tags onto their lemmas instead
of inserting them as separate input tokens. See Fig-
ure 2 for an example. This concatenation creates
distinctions between some lemmas, which will ide-
ally correspond to morphological distinctions made
in English. Although this transformation splits the
Czech data (relative to pure lemmatization), it still
suppresses many of the distinctions made in the full
Czech wordforms. We expected that number mark-

ing on nouns and tense marking on verbs would be
the tags best treated in this way.
3.4 Morphemes
Our final set of experiments used the same input for-
mat as the Modified Lemma experiments. However,
in this set of experiments, we changed the model used
to calculate the word-to-word alignment probabili-
ties. In the standard system, the alignment model
parameters P (fj |ei) are found using maximum like-
lihood estimation based on the expected number of
times fj aligns to ei in the parallel corpus. Our new
model assumes a compositional structure for fj , so
that fj = fj0 . . . fjK , where fj0 is the lemma of
fj , and fj1 . . . fjK are morphemes generated from
the tags associated with fj . We assume that every
word contains exactly K morphemes, and that the
kth morpheme in each word is used to encode the
value for the kth class of morphological tag, where
the classes (e.g. person or tense) are assigned an or-
dering beforehand. fjk is assigned a null value if the
value of the kth tag class is unspecified for fj .
Given this decomposition of words into mor-
phemes, and a generative model in which each mor-
pheme in fj is generated independently conditioned
on ei, we have
P(fj|ei) =
K
?
k=0
P(fjk|ei) (2)
We can now estimate P(fj |ei) using a slightly
modified version of the standard EM algorithm for
learning alignment probabilities. During the E step,
we calculate the expected alignment counts between
Czech morphemes and English words based on the
current word alignments, and revise our estimate of
P(fj|ei) using Equation 2. The M step of the algo-
rithm remains the same.
The morpheme-based model in Equation 2 is sim-
ilar to the modified lemma model in that it removes
much of the differentiation between Czech word-
forms, but leaves the differences that are most likely
to appear as inflection on English words. However,
it also performs an additional smoothing function.
The model assumes that, in the absence of other in-
formation, an English word that has aligned mostly
to Czech words with a particular morphological tag
is more likely to align to another word with this tag
than to a Czech word with a different tag. For ex-
ample, an English word aligned to mostly past tense
forms is more likely to align to another past tense
form than to a present or future tense form.
4 Experiments
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the tech-
niques described in the previous section, we ran a
number of experiments using data from the PCEDT
corpus. The English portion of this corpus (used to
train the language model) contains the same material
as the Penn WSJ corpus, but with a different divi-
sion into training, development, and test sets. About
250 sentences each for development and test were
translated once into Czech and then back into En-
glish by five different translators. These translations
are used to calculate BLEU scores. The remainder
of the corpus (about 50,000 sentences) is used for
training. About 21,000 of the training sentences have
been translated into Czech and morphologically an-
notated for use as a parallel corpus.
Some statistics on the parallel corpus are shown
in the graph in Figure 3. This graph illustrates the
sparse data problem in Czech that our morpholog-
ical analysis is intended to address. Although the
number of infrequently occurring lemmas is about
the same in both English and Czech, the number of
infrequently occurring inflected wordforms is approx-
imately twice as high in Czech.1
For all of our experiments, we used the same lan-
guage model, trained with the CMU Statistical Lan-
guage Modelling Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld,
1997). Our translation models were trained using
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which we modi-
1Although we did not use it for the experiments in
this paper, the PCEDT corpus does contain lemma in-
formation for the English data. There is a slight discrep-
ancy between the English and Czech data in the lemma
information for pronouns, in that English pronouns (in-
cluding accusitive, possessive, and other forms) are as-
signed themselves as lemmas, whereas Czech pronouns
are reduced to uninflected forms. Given that pronouns
generally have many tokens, this discrepancy should not
affect the data in Figure 3.

fied as necessary for the morpheme-based experi-
ments. We used the ISI ReWrite Decoder (Marcu
and Germann, 2005) for producing translations. Be-
fore beginning our experiments, we obtained a base-
line BLEU score by training a standard word-to-word
translation model. Our baseline results indicate that
the test set for this corpus is considerably more diffi-
cult than the development set: word-to-word scores
were .311 (development) and .270 (test).
4.1 Lemmas
As Figure 3 shows, lemmatization of the Czech cor-
pus cuts the number of unique items by more than
half, and the number of items with no more than
ten occurrences by nearly half. The lemmatization
BLEU scores in Table 1 indicate that this has a large
impact on the quality of translation. As expected,
full lemmatization performed better than word-to-
word translation, with an an improvement of about
.04 in the development set BLEU score and .03 in
the test set. (In this and the following experiments,
BLEU score differences of .009 or more are signifi-
cant at the .05 level.) Experiments on the develop-
ment set showed that leaving certain parts of speech
unlemmatized did not improve results, but lemma-
tizing only low-frequency words did. A frequency
cutoff of 50 worked best on the development set (i.e.
only words with frequency less than 50 were lemma-
tized). Despite the improvement on the development
set, using this cutoff with the test set yielded only a
non-significant improvement over full lemmatization.
The results of these lemmatization experiments
support the argument that lemmatization improves
translation quality by reducing data sparseness, but
also removes potentially useful information. Our re-

sults suggest that lemmatizing only infrequent words
may, in some cases, work better than lemmatizing all
words.
As Table 1 indicates, it is possible to get some
of the benefits of lemmatization without using any
morphological knowledge at all. For both dev and
test sets, truncating words to 6 characters (the best
length on the dev set) provided a significant im-
provement over word-to-word translation, but was
also significantly worse than the best lemmatization
scores. Changing the frequency cutoff for trunca-
tion did not produce any significant differences in
the BLEU score.
4.2 Pseudowords
Results for the pseudoword experiments on the devel-
opment set are shown in the first column of Table 2.
Note that in these (and the following) experiments,
we treated all words the same way regardless of their
frequency, so the effects of adding morphological in-
formation are in comparison to the full lemmatiza-
tion scheme. In most of our experiments, we added
morphological information for only a single class of
tags at a time in order to determine the effects of
each class individually. The classes we used were
verb person (PER), verb tense (TEN), noun number
(NUM), noun case (CASE), and negation (NEG).
Most of the results of the pseudoword experiments
confirm our expectations. Adding the verb person
tags was helpful, and examination of the alignments
revealed that they did indeed align to English pro-
nouns with high probability. The noun number tags
did not help, since plurality is expressed as an affix
in English. Negation tags helped slightly, though the
improvement was not significant. This is probably
because negation tags are relatively infrequent, as
can be seen in Table 3. The addition of pseudowords
for case did not yield an improvement, probably be-
cause these pseudowords were so frequent. The ad-
ditional ambiguity caused by so many extra words
likely overwhelmed any positive effect.
A somewhat puzzling result is the behavior of the

verb tense tags. With the exception of future tense,
English generally does not mark tense with an aux-
iliary. Yet Table 3 shows that only a very small per-
centage of sentences have a future tense marker, so
it seems unlikely that this explains the positive ef-
fects of the tense pseudowords. In fact, we tried
adding only future tense pseudowords to the lem-
matized Czech data, and found that the results were
no better than basic lemmatization.
The other unusual behavior we see with pseu-
dowords is that when verb person and tense tags are
combined, they seem to cancel each other out, result-
ing in a score that is no better than lemmatization
alone. Examination of the alignments did not reveal
any obvious reason for this effect.
4.3 Modified Lemmas
As shown in the second column of Table 2, the num-
ber and tense tags yield an improvement under the
modified lemma transformation, while the person
tags do not. Again, this confirms our predictions
based on the morphology of English.
Our results using the case tags under this model
actually decreased performance, but this is not
surprising given that differentiating Czech lemmas
based on case marking creates as much as a 7-way
split of the data (there are seven cases in Czech),
without adding much information that would be use-
ful in English.
4.4 Morphemes
BLEU scores for the morpheme-based model are
given in the third column of Table 2. None of the
differences in scores between this model and the mod-
ified lemma model are significant, although the trend
for most of the tag classes is for this model to per-
form slightly worse. This suggests that the type of
smoothing induced by the morpheme-based model
may not be as helpful as simply attempting to cre-
ate Czech words that reflect the same morphological
distinctions as the English words. In Section 5, we
propose a generalized version of the morpheme model
that might be an improvement.
4.5 Combined Model
In the experiments described so far, we used only
a single method at a time of incorporating mor-
phological information into the translation process.
However, it is straightforward to combine the pseu-
doword method with either the modified-lemma or
morpheme-based methods by using pseudowords for
certain tags and attaching others to the Czech lem-
mas. The experiments described above allowed us to
confirm our intuitions about how each class of tags
should be treated under such a combined model. We
then created a model using the pseudoword treat-
ment of the person and negation tags, and the mod-
ified lemma treatment of number and tense. We did
not use the case tags in this model, since they did
not seem to yield an improvement in any of the three
basic morphological models.
Our combined model achieved a BLEU score of
.390 (development) and .333 (test), outperforming
the models in all of our previous experiments.
5 Discussion
The results of our experiments provide additional
support for the findings of previous researchers that
using morphological analysis can improve the quality
of statistical machine translation for highly-inflected
languages. While human judgment is probably the
best metric for evaluating translation quality, our use
of the automatically-derived BLEU score allowed us
to easily compare many different translation models
and evaluate the effects of each one individually. We
found that simple lemmatization, by significantly re-
ducing the sparse data problem, was quite effective
681
despite the loss of information involved. Lemmatiz-
ing the less frequent words in the corpus seemed to
increase performance slightly, but these results were
inconclusive. Word truncation, which requires no
morphological information at all, was effective at in-
creasing scores over the word-to-word baseline, but
did not perform quite as well as lemmatization. This
result conflicts with Och?s (Och, 1995), and is likely
due to the much smaller size of our corpus. In any
case, our results suggest that lemmatization or word
truncation could yield a significant improvement in
the quality of translation from a highly-inflected to
a less-inflected language, even when limited morpho-
logical information is available.
Our primary results concern the use of full mor-
phological information. We found that certain tags
were more useful when we treated them as discrete
input words, while others provided a greater benefit
when attached directly to their lemmas. The best
choice of which method to use for each class of tags
seems to correspond closely with how that class of in-
formation is expressed in English (either using func-
tion words or inflection). In a sense, the goal of the
morphological analysis is to make the Czech input
data more English-like by suppressing unnecessary
morphological distinctions and expressing necessary
distinctions in ways that are similar to English. This
sort of procedure could be taken further by incorpo-
rating syntactic information as well, but as we stated
earlier, our goal was to determine exactly how much
benefit we could derive from a strictly morphological
approach.
In the work we have presented, the output lan-
guage (English) is low in inflection. We therefore
considered it less important to perform morphologi-
cal analysis on the English data. However, we expect
that the work described here could be generalized to
highly inflected output languages by doing morpho-
logical analysis on both the input and output lan-
guages. The most promising way to do this seems
to be by extending the morpheme-based translation
model in Equation 2 to incorporate morphemes in
both languages, so that
P(fj|ei) =
K
?
k=0
P(fjk|eik) (3)
where fjk are the morphemes in the input language,
and eik are the corresponding morphemes in the out-
put language. This extended model may also prove
a benefit to Czech-English translation; we are cur-
rently investigating this possibility.
In this work, we used a word-based translation sys-
tem due to the availability of source code that could
be modified for our morph experiments. An obvious
extension to the current work would be to move to a
phrase-based translation system. One advantage of
phrase-based models is their ability to align phrases
in one language to morphologically complex words in
the other language. However, this feature still suffers
from the same sparse data problems as a word-based
system: if a morphologically complex word only ap-
pears a handful of times in the training corpus, the
system will have difficulty determining its (phrasal
or word) alignment. We expect that morphological
analysis would still be helpful in this situation, at the
very least because it can be used to remove distinc-
tions that appear in only one language.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we used morphological analysis of
Czech to improve a Czech-English statistical machine
translation system. We have argued that this im-
provement was primarily due to a reduction of the
sparse data problem caused by the highly inflected
nature of Czech. An alternative method for reducing
sparse data is to use a larger parallel corpus; however,
it is often easier to obtain additional monolingual re-
sources, such as a morphological analyzer or tagged
corpus, than additional parallel data for a specific
language pair. For that reason, we believe that the
approach taken here is a promising one.
We have described several different ways of using
morphological information for machine translation,
and have shown how these can be combined to yield
an improved translation model. In general, we would
not expect the exact combination of techniques that
yielded our best results for Czech-English to be op-
timal for other language pairs. Rather, we have sug-
gested that these techniques should be combined in
a way that makes the input language more similar
to the output language. Although this combination
will need to be determined for each language pair, the
general approach outlined here should provide ben-
efits for any MT system involving a highly inflected
language.
