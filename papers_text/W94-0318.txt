We describe the application of multilingual text 
generation i a system for assisting the process 
of publication. This system is an editor's work- 
bench for preparation of the publication of an 
art history encyclopedia (the Macmillan Dic- 
tionary of Art), which is itself part of an in- 
tegrated pub!ication environment being devel- 
oped at GMD-IPSI. We show how an editor's 
tasks can be facilitated by the use of NLP (nat- 
ural language processing) systems and suggest 
the important role of text generation i future 
electronic publications as products. In both 
cases, we focus on text generation as providing 
an essential new mode of information presen- 
tation. Text generation provides a quality gain 
in which the flexibility of the electronic product 
is augmented; in particular, views on knowl- 
edge expressed as text, possibly in different lan- 
guages are incorporated. The major prerequi- 
site for making this possible is an explicit and 
systematic representation f genres or text types 
combined with a general interfacing method for 
specific domain knowledge. 
1 Overv iew o f  the  paper  
The function of this paper is two fold. First, we present 
an example of a new application area for text genera- 
tion: support ools for electronic publishing. Second, we 
provide a brief overview of a new generation architec- 
ture based closely on the 'stratified context' systemic- 
functional linguistic model of \[Martin, 1992\]. The aim 
of the latter introduction is primarily to promote discus- 
sion of this kind of architecture, since the details that 
can be presented in the space of this paper are neces- 
sarily limited. The architecture is also highly experi- 
mental at this time. The simultaneous presentation of
an application emphasizes the systemic-functional lin-

guistic commitment to the inseparability of theory and 
practise. 
The background context of the work reported here 
is an electronic publishing support tool consisting of a 
workbench for assisting the tasks of an editor involved 
in the construction of a large encyclopedia of art his- 
tory, the Macmillan Dictionary of Art. This editor's 
workbench \[MShr and Rostek, 1993, Rostek et at., 1994\] 
is part of an integrated publication environment, which 
has been used as a framework for the design of an elec- 
tronic newspaper \[Haake t al., 1993\]. We are currently 
involved in adding natural anguage processing capabil- 
ities to this system--including most relevantly for this 
paper, multilingual text generation. This is being used 
both to further the theoretical specification and practi- 
cal implementation f the text generation system and to 
enable us to concretely propose the application of text 
generation both in the electronically-assisted construc- 
tion of encyclopedic works and in the electronic version 
of the electronic publication as product. 
In this paper, we concentrate particularly on the use 
of the text generation system in order to bring a new 
functionality to the editor's workbench. The text gen- 
eration component supports a range of flexible presen- 
tation styles tailored to the editor's requirements. The 
applicability of the text generation system is supported 
by two crucial capabilities: 
* the knowledge of genres or text types, which are 
taken to be the ultimate constraining factor for the 
realization of views on domain knowledge as text, 
* a methodology for building a generic interface to 
domain knowledge. 
We suggest how both these aspects have been strongly 
supported by a version of the systemic-functional lin-
guistic model employing a stratified view of context. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents 
our view of the role of natural anguage processing in 
electronic publication and introduces our application 
scenario. We outline here the editor's workbench and 
describe the necessary application of NLP components, 
focussing on text generation. We further show how 
the specific linguistic paradigm we are working with, 
systemic-functional linguistics, supports the integrated 
publication scenario. Section 3.1 presents the text gen- 
eration component in more detail. We argue that the 
153

newly gained flexibility (views on domain knowledge x- 
pressed as text) can only be made possible in practice 
if the genre of the text to be produced is explicitly rep- 
resented. Section 4 gives an example of generation. We 
conclude the paper with a summary of the new oppor- 
tunities offered for electronic publishing and electronic 
and print publications when automatic text generation 
is made available in the way proposed (Section 5). 
2 Electronic publication and NLP 
Electronic publishing is an application domain in which 
the acquisition, representation and presentation of 
knowledge are major tasks which are to be fulfilled by 
an editor. State-of-the-art electronic publishing tech- 
nology offers a number of possibilities both to facilitate 
these tasks and to improve on the quality of print and 
of electronic publications. In publishing in general, the 
document or text plays a central role in that it is both 
source and product of the publication process. Many of 
the tasks of an editor in this process are of a highly recur- 
sive character and are subject o a number of publisher- 
specific standards an editor must use. For example, the 
header of a biography text usually adheres to some spec- 
ified standard of what information must be included and 
at which place. Typically, the header first gives the name 
or pseudonym of the artist, then his/her place and date 
of birth (an-d death), and possibly his/her main activity 
(painter, sculptor, architect etc). Such highly standard- 
ized information is currently automatically classified into 
a net of domain knowledge by applying pattern match- 
ing methods (see \[Rostek et at., 1994\] for examples and 
the methods employed). 
The construction of a taxonomic inheritance hierar- 
chy that this allows already offers new opportunities for 
accessing the information included and can be used to 
assist some of the above mentioned tasks of an editor. 
If, however, one would like to be able to apply these 
methods improving information access and assisting the 
editor's tasks to other kinds of information that are less 
standardized, the question arises of how to acquire these 
and integrate them in an object net.. For example, in a 
biography article, the typical information i cluded is the 
artist's education, influences on his/her work by other 
artists and art styles, his/her major works etc. This is 
information that can appear in any place in the text-- 
or even in several texts--and can be realized linguisti- 
cally in various ways. Extracting such information from 
source texts requires more sophisticated methods and 
representations that reflect the facts contained in the 
source text. The most adequate way to acquire this 
knowledge is automatic NL text analysis. 
For an example of how this enriches the information 
represented in the object net see Figure 1, taking the ex- 
ample of the main activities and creations of the archi- 
tect Peter Behrens3 This is mostly a network obtained 
by the KONTEXT analysis ystem for German \[Haenelt,

objects and domain-specific objects are given in dark grey 
ellipses; instances are given in boxes.

Figure h Knowledge acquired by NL text analysis

or duplicated here for presentation purposes. 
We assume that information of this kind and de- 
gree of complexity will become increasingly common in 
knowledge-based systems. We also assume that sys- 
tems that previously worked with full-texts will increas- 
ingly become knowledge-based systems. However, hav- 
ing made available such a rich variety of potentially rel- 
evant information i this way, the complementary prob- 
lem of presenting that information again to the user be- 
comes the limiting factor. In our present case, the edi- 
tor's workbench already offers a number of presentation 
styles for the information contained, such as the net or 
parts of the net (as shown in Figure 1, internal defini- 
tions associated with a node, article text associated with 
a node and cross-references toother objects, etc. Repre- 
sentation of complex information i  the net style, how- 
ever, quickly becomes too complex to be generally appro- 
priate (as the rather simple example of Figure 1 probably 
already demonstrates). With a net augmented both in 
types of information and in quantity, other presentation 
styles as views on the information contained are essential 
for enabling an editor to deal with such complex infor- 
mation. One such presentation style that can flexibly 
express retrieved information is automatically generated 
text. Information including that displayed in Figure 1 
(and other information ot shown) is better expressed 
as the following text.

Behrens' principal activities were 
industrial design and architecture. He 
designed prototype flasks and electrical 
appliances. As an architect, he built the 
turbine factory and the high tension plant 
for AEG (.1908-10). For the workers of AEG 
he built a housing area in Henningsdorf. 
Behrens created a number of monumental 
buildings, such as the Mannesmann 
administration building in Dfisseldorf and 
the German embassy in St. Petersburg.

3 The  text  generat ion  arch i tec ture  
3.1 Origins 
For the kind of functionality set out in the previous ec- 
tion to be both achievable in theory and worthwhile in 
practise, we consider two features of a text generation 
component to be decisive. First, the text generation sys- 
tem must achieve a high degree of domain-independence 
in order to maximally re-use its resources. Such re- 
sources are too expensive to develop to allow redesign for 
different applications. And second, it must make provi- 
sion for the systematic representation f genres and text 
types that it will be called to generate. The representa- 
tion of genre not only offers a major constraint on the 
text generation process, including its access to domain 
knowledge, but also allows highly restricted fine-tuning 
of a system's generation capabilities. 
The generation system being used in our application 
scenario is one under development in two continuing di- 
rections. First, it is multilingualin the extreme sense de- 
fined by \[Bateman et al, 1991a, Bateman et al, 1991b\]. 
The system thus supports extensive linguistic resource 
sharing on a functional basis. Second, it is intended to 
incorporate sensitivity to register as targetted by \[Bate- 
man and Paris, !989, Bateman and Paris, 1991\]. The 
system processes are based on the PENMAN generation 
system \[Mann and Matthiessen, 1985\] as extended for 
multilinguality by \[Zeng, 1992\], and includes work on 
multilinguality and text planning undertaken within the 
KOMET project \[Bateman et al, 1993\]. The resulting 
system therefore has the working title KPML (KOMEW- 
Penman multilingual). 
The primary difference between the KOMET-PENMAN 
system and PENMAN is that KPML attempts to apply 
systemic-functional linguistic results at all levels of oper- 
ation, following through some of the proposals for inter- 
action between systemic linguistics and computational 
models made in \[Bateman, 1988\]. It therefore includes 
linguistic resources at various strata such as: 
? the systemic functional grammar NIGEL for En- 
glish \[Matthiessen, 1992\] and the KOMET grammars 
for German \[Teich, 1992\] and for Dutch \[Degand, 
19931, 
? a merged upper model \[Henschel, 1993\] appropriate 
for generation with all three grammars, 
? systemic-functional networks for register, based 
on \[Martin, 1992\], 
? system-functional networks for genre, also based 
on \[Martin, 1992\]. 
Work on discourse semantics, in the sense defined 
in \[Martin, 1992\], is also in progress 2 Realization is cap- 
tured in terms of relational constraints holding across 
features and structures defined by the networks of ad- 
jacent strata. These are still partially implemented in

search project. 
terms of Penman-style 'preselection', althoush nondirec- 
tional relations uch as those suggested in \[Bateman et 
al., 1992\] are both necessary and under investigation. 
3.2 Genre  and  Register :  the  global- level  
textua l  resource  
According to systemic-functional theory (SFL), the ul- 
timate constraints on all linguistic expression are the 
extra-linguistic contexts of culture and situation. Espe- 
cially in a multilingual application this must be taken 
into account since it is only in these extra-linguistic con- 
texts that commonalities and differences between lan- 
guages can ultimately be rooted. In early work on text 
in context such as \[Hasan, 1978\], the cultural context 
is reflected in language in terms of text as the linguis- 
tic category of genre. Genre is a culture-specific cate- 
gory textually encoding a situation as it can typically 
occur in a culture or linguistic community. Thus, it is 
at the interface between what is linguistic and what is 
non-linguistic knowledge. The particular view on genre 
and context hat we instantiate in the KOMET-PENMAN 
architecture 3 is that proposed in \[Martin, 1992\]. Here 
context is divided into two strata, register and genre. 
Both are fully represented in our model. 
Genre is represented in SFL by generic structure po- 
tential (GSP), specifying the potential typically occur- 
ring stages according to which a text belonging to a par- 
ticular genre develops \[Hasan, 1978\]. As a brief example 
of a GSP and its application, a typical field (one of the 
parameters of register; cf. below) in the domain of arts 
is information about an artist's life. A typical situation 
in terms of field involves all kinds of activities and events 
a particular artist is or was involved in in his/her career 
and the circumstances under which these events take or 
took place. It is not possible from this information alone 
to construct any particular text. Only when a particular 
text type has been selected is it possible to determine 
what information from the field is relevant and how it is 
to be presented. One genre that usefully expresses uch 
a typical situation is the biography. A typical GSP for 
a biography text then has the following stages, of which 
not all are obligatory: 
GSP stages 
Names, birth and death 
Education, development of career 
Major activities, major works 
Influences, analogies to other artists 
Impact 
Uncovering such generic structures is a large empirical 
task that needs to be addressed in text generation: a sys- 
tem such as KPML can then be seen as one candidate way 
of noting the results of such studies in an immediately 
usable fashion. 
Following \[Martin, 1992\], we provide a systemic ac- 
count of genre using the same representational means as 
for grammatical descriptions (system networks). This 
permits generic structures to be constructed according 
to the selection of genre features in exactly the same

way that grammatical structures are constructed in our 
grammars--i.e., by means of the selection of grammat- 
ical features in system networks. The GSPs that result 
then condition the further realization of register selec- 
tions in the linguistic system proper. Thus situation 
types are related to the linguistic system in particular 
ways by the selection of particular genres. The systemi- 
cization of genre specifications also ensures that there 
can be maximal re-use of existing genre specifications 
when new genres, slightly differing from already treated 
ones, are considered. 
Furthermore, as noted by \[Matthiessen, 1988\], generic 
structures are in many ways similar to \[McKeown, 
1985\]'s rhetorical schemas. They can also be used, there- 
fore, in order to pre-structure the information to be ex- 
pressed in a text. Particular kinds of information go 
together with particular stages of the GSP. The specifi- 
cation of this information--in our case as constraints in
the genre network concerning appropriate selections of 
field features and structures-7-provides the content for 
information retrieval inquiries that are passed on to the 
editor's workbench for instantiation. An example of such 
a specification is shown in the instantiate realizations for 
the genre-feature \[biography\] given in Figure 2. The re- 
alization constraints stage introduce generic stages in a 
GSP; the constraints inter-preselect-feature constrain a
given generic stage to be realized by a particular register 
feature selection. 
The use of GSPs for knowledge selection is further en- 
hanced by our requirement that domain information is
already classified according to a general conceptual hier- 
archy for organizing domain information that is specified 
by KOMET-PENMAN internally. This guarantees that the 
retrieved information is in a form which can be read- 
ily interpreted by the other resources of the linguistic 
system maintained internally to KOMET-PENMAN. This 
provides the definitions for the semantic types used in 
the SPL-like second parameter to the 'instantiate' con- 
straints hown in Figure 2. At present, information is
retrieved from the editor's workbench which matches the 
these second parameters. Work in progress is exploring 
more sophisticated information retrieval operations. 
The representation f genre therefore offers a major 
constraint on the text generation process, including its 
access to domain knowledge. As mentioned before, not 
all of the stages of a GsP are obligatory. This gives rise to 
a number of subtypes of the biography genre. For exam- 
ple, a short biographical entry, as it typically occurs in an 
encyclopedia realizes all stages and tends to be activity- 
focussed and timeline organized. Our sample text 1, on 
the other hand, did not realize all stages; it presents 
more the roles Behrens took on as an artist (designer, 
architect) and his major works in one of these roles (the 
text therefore focuses on activities of creation and the 
results of these creative processes and is not explicitly 
timeline organized). Both kinds of texts are, however, 
useful for an editor (and for an information seeker) in 
particular contexts and so both should be available pre- 
sentation styles. Unless the text generation component 
allows the ready definition of such genres and their lin- 
guistic realizations with maximal re-usablity of existing 
resources, uch flexibility will be compromised. 
The next strata in the system, register, is further de- 
scribed in terms of the three parameters of field, tenor 
and mode. Field describes the states and events and par- 
ticipants occurring in a particular situation. Tenor refers 
to the roles and statuses of the participants in a partic- 
ular situation. Mode refers to the symbolic organization 
of the situation as text, including the channel of com- 
munication and the rhetoric goals \[Halliday and Hasan, 
1989, p12\]. Specific sets of values that realize field, tenor 
and mode bring about situation types or registers. Par- 
ticular situation types accordingly constrain the kind of 
language that may occur in those situations. 
Certain aspects of register are constrained by the sit- 
uation that the text generator is to understand itself 
as being in--thus, whether the text is to be written 
or spoken, whether the relationship between the hearer 
and the speaker/writer is distant or close, etc. must be 
selected externally. The provision of such features in 
the register specification automatically provides a high 
degree of parameterization. Moreover, the field infor- 
mation provides a natural home for many aspects that 
would traditionally be included under 'domain knowl- 
edge'. This information is quite removed from its ex- 
pression in natural language. In order to interface with 
such information, however, we provide a general sub- 
sumption hierarchy analogous to previous usages of the 
upper model within PENMAN (cf. \[Bateman, 1990\]). Fur- 
ther details of the motivation and development of this 
hierarchy are given in \[Bateman et al, 1994\]. This 
(domain-independent) 'upper structure' of the domain 
knowledge is motivated by the semantics defined by 
our NLP components (e.g. \[Kunze and Firzlaff, 1993, 
Bateman et al, 1990, Henschel, 1993\]). We see exam- 
ples of the use of the hierarchy in Figure 1 in the net 
objects prefixed by Mea-. 
The hierarchy can in general be considered to be 
a system network with realization constraints (further 
conditionalized by the contributions of feature selec- 
tions from the mode and tenor hierarchies) effecting 
156 
7th International Generation Workshop ? Kennebunkport, Maine ? June 21-24, 1994 
the possible semantic and grammatical realizations that 
may be adopted. However, the interfacing with domain 
knowledge is further supported by allowing the mixing 
of KOMET-PENMAN internally specified system networks 
and externally specified resource organizations, uch as, 
e.g., that for domain knowledge. Most of the upper 
structure for the domain knowledge is therefore repre- 
sented externally in SFK (the 'Smalltalk FFrameKit' \[Fis- 
cher and Rostek, 1993\]), which is the implementation 
language for the editor's workbench. This is linked back 
to a KOMET-PENMAN internal portion of the hierarchy 
which directly attaches to the top-most field features 
and positions the combined field hierarchy with respect 
to tenor and mode. When an external field feature has 
consequences for linguistic realization, it is ' imported' 
into the KOMET-PENMAN internal systemic network by 
means of external-system definitions. These function en- 
tirely analogously to internal systems as far as the con- 
nectivity of the network is concerned, but the selection 
of features in such systems is linked directly to the state 
of the corresponding external representation. In practice 
this permits modUles of external 'system networks' to be 
incorporated in the text generation process. 
The constraints of the genre specification as GSP and 
register on local-level discourse organization of the text 
are manifold. For example, with a GSP for a biography 
text as sketched above, the thematic development is typi- 
cally taking'the person the text is about as macro-theme. 
Also, very often biography texts are organized along a 
time line - -  circumstantials of time such as dates, years 
or time adverbials are therefore often thematic or part 
of theme. We are currently extending the set of such 
constraints based on further analysis of text types that 
are useful in our application context. 
Finally, as already noted, there can also be subtypes 
of the biography genre that do not have all of the stages 
listed above, but focus on one or two of them, leav- 
ing out others (see again sample text 2). They there- 
fore realize only parts of the information available in 
the field of context (i.e. the domain knowledge). This 
contributes to the formation of distinct views on the 
information maintained in the editor's workbench and 
electronic publications: The organization of the possi- 
ble genres in terms of a systemic lassification hierarchy 
then guarantees that we are able to capture similarities 
between related genres and to represent the constraints 
they share in an efficient fashion. 
4 Example  of generat ion 
In this section we present a very brief example of gen- 
eration in the context of the editor's workbench. The 
system is configured according to the overall architec- 
ture shown in Figure 3. The requirement that text be 
generated is embedded in the editor's interaction with 
the editor's workbench. A range of possible types of 
presentation are offered: currently these are restricted

to several subtypes of biographies. The text generation 
process is then started with the constraint that some set 
of genre features hold; in addition, some set of regis- 
ter features are also selected in order to characterize the 
communicative situation. The text generation compo- 
nent then constructs a full GSP specification for the text 
type. This sets up staged sets of constraints on knowl- 
edge to be selected from the domain. That information 
is retrieved and classified according to the complete reg- 
ister classification etwork. This establishes 
* a set of constraints for the semantics and grammar, 
? a set of pools of contextual information that are to 
be realized linguistically. 
The latter are then organized rhetorically, thematically, 
ideationally, etc. according to the constrained semantics, 
which results in sets of rhetorically organized seman- 
tic specifications that can be passed to the constrained 
grammar for final realization. 
More specifically, the text generation component car- 
ries out the following operations. First, the edi- 
tor's workbench provides a focus for the textual sum- 
mary that is to be constructed for the internal in- 
formation represented and triggers generation. A 
specific genre must also be selected at this point: 
for example, one classified by the set of genre 
features: {activity-focused partial-biography 
third-person-recount particularized 
fac tua l -genre) .  These features give rise to the con- 
crete GSP: 
(DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES) 
Each of these stages has particular information eeds, 
which are then instantiated with respect to the knowl- 
edge base. For example, for the stage ACTIVITIES, the 
information eeded consists of events and activities the 
artist dealt with is involved in as actor or causer. This 
is specified in an SFK retrieval pattern with the artist 
(Behrens) as starting point and providing the slot path 
along which the retrieval takes place; this is shown in 
Figure 4. 
An example of the result of this information request 
is as follows: 
(SFK-337 / MEACREATION

(SFK-342 / (AEGMEAOBJECT

Here a number of domain instances (SFK-337, etc.) 
with particular types (e.g., 
MEACREATION, MEAOBJECT, etc.) are returned. These 
types are as defined in the field conceptual hierarchy. In- 
stances with particular types also have associated roles 
(e.g., ACTOR, TARGET, PARTOF). The instance specifi- 
cation as a whole represents a partial register-stratum 
structure. This partial structure is then filled out to a 
maximal description by traversing the register-stratum 
classification etworks. This traversal is partially con- 
strained by the GSP, by the instantial domain structure, 
and the specified context of generation. The result of 
this traversal is a full set of register features, and a set of 
corresponding constraints on the semantic and discourse 
realization of the generic stage. An extract from a reg- 
ister 'profile' resulting from such a traversal is shown in 
Figure 5. 
These constraints are then applied during the fur- 
ther lexicogrammatical expression of the information re- 
trieved from the knowledge base in order to construct 
an appropriate text. This is mediated by the local- 
discourse semantics that groups the information of the 
generic stage into rhetorically organized semantic speci- 
fications. These specifications consist of a statement of 
the propositional content, plus discourse constraints. An 
example is shown in Figure 6. 
The final (English) text then generated is, in this case, 
as follows.

5 Conc lus ions  
In this paper we have presented the experimental inter- 
facing of a multilingual text generation system, KOMET- 
PENMAN, to domain knowledge about arts and art his- 
tory in an editor's workbench assisting the publication 
of an art encyclopedia. The major improvement that the 
application of text generation offers is a gain in flexibility 
with regard to the presentation of views on the domain 
knowledge. The text generation system itself organizes 
the access to the domain knowledge in a linguistically- 
motivated way: The representation f genre constrains 
information access, thus predefining, as it were, the tex- 
tual views that are possible to be taken on the informa- 
tion contained in biographical entries in the encyclope- 
dia. The method proposed for the editor's workbench

can be taken further to apply to the overall publication 
scenario and to a possible electronic publication, offering 
the newly added functionality to the reader also. 
Future work within the scenario described here will 
now include: 
? expansion of the genres available, 
? expansion of the discourse semantics to improve tex- 
tuality, 
? an investigation of the use of a genre representation 
for also structuring a (restricted) NL query inter- 
face, 
? an investigation of the user of the generalized types 
of the domain knowledge upper structure for facili- 
tating information retrieval, 
? a coordination of the textual realization of views 
on domain knowledge with a graphical presentation 
mode-- thus other presentation styles to be auto- 
matically generated should include graphics, tables, 
figures etc.; some early steps towards this in the ed- 
itor's workbench context are presented in \[Kamps, 
1993\].
