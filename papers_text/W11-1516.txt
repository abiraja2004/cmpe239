Abstract
Academic collaboration has often been at
the forefront of scientific progress, whether
amongst prominent established researchers, or
between students and advisors. We suggest a
theory of the different types of academic col-
laboration, and use topic models to computa-
tionally identify these in Computational Lin-
guistics literature. A set of author-specific
topics are learnt over the ACL corpus, which
ranges from 1965 to 2009. The models are
trained on a per year basis, whereby only pa-
pers published up until a given year are used
to learn that year?s author topics. To determine
the collaborative properties of papers, we use,
as a metric, a function of the cosine similarity
score between a paper?s term vector and each
author?s topic signature in the year preceding
the paper?s publication. We apply this metric
to examine questions on the nature of collabo-
rations in Computational Linguistics research,
finding that significant variations exist in the
way people collaborate within different sub-
fields.
1 Introduction
Academic collaboration is on the rise as single au-
thored work becomes less common across the sci-
ences (Rawlings and McFarland, 2011; Jones et al,
2008; Newman, 2001). In part, this rise can be at-
tributed to the increasing specialization of individual
academics and the broadening in scope of the prob-
lems they tackle. But there are other advantages to
collaboration, as well: they can speed up produc-
tion, diffuse knowledge across authors, help train
new scientists, and are thought to encourage greater
innovation. Moreover, they can integrate scholarly
communities and foster knowledge transfer between
related fields. But all collaborations aren?t the same:
different collaborators contribute different material,
assume different roles, and experience the collabo-
ration in different ways. In this paper, we present
a new frame for thinking about the variation in col-
laboration types and develop a computational metric
to characterize the distinct contributions and roles of
each collaborator within the scholarly material they
produce.
The topic of understanding collaborations has at-
tracted much interest in the social sciences over the
years. Recently, it has gained traction in computer
science, too, in the form of social network analysis.
Much work focuses on studying networks formed
via citations (Radev et al, 2009; White and Mccain,
1998), as well as co-authorship links (Nascimento
et al, 2003; Liu et al, 2005). However, these works
focus largely on the graphical structure derived from
paper citations and author co-occurrences, and less
on the textual content of the papers themselves. In
this work, we examine the nature of academic col-
laboration using text as a primary component.
We propose a theoretical framework for determin-
ing the types of collaboration present in a docu-
ment, based on factors such as the number of es-
tablished authors, the presence of unestablished au-
thors and the similarity of the established authors?
past work to the document?s term vector. These col-
laboration types attempt to describe the nature of co-
authorships between students and advisors (e.g. ?ap-
prentice? versus ?new blood?) as well as those solely
between established authors in the field. We present
a decision diagram for classifying papers into these
types, as well as a description of the intuition behind
each collaboration class.

We explore our theory with a computational
method to categorize collaborative works into their
collaboration types using an approach based on topic
modeling, where we model every paper as a la-
tent mixture of its authors. For our system, we use
Labeled-LDA (LLDA (Ramage et al, 2009)) to train
models over the ACL corpus for every year of the
words best attributed to each author in all the papers
they write. We use the resulting author signatures
as a basis for several metrics that can classify each
document by its collaboration type.
We qualitatively analyze our results by examin-
ing the categorization of several high impact papers.
With consultation from prominent researchers and
textbook writers in the field, we demonstrate that our
system is able to differentiate between the various
types of collaborations in our suggested taxonomy,
based only on words used, at low but statistically
significant accuracy. We use this same similarity
score to analyze the ACL community by sub-field,
finding significant deviations.
2 Related Work
In recent years, popular topic models such as La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al, 2003) have
been increasingly used to study the history of sci-
ence by observing the changing trends in term based
topics (Hall et al, 2008), (Gerrish and Blei, 2010).
In the case of Hall et al, regular LDA topic mod-
els were trained over the ACL anthology on a per
year basis, and the changing trends in topics were
studied from year to year. Gerrish and Blei?s work
computed a measure of influence by using Dynamic
Topic Models (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) and study-
ing the change of statistics of the language used in a
corpus.
These models propose interesting ideas for utiliz-
ing topic modeling to understand aspects of scien-
tific history. However, our primary interest, in this
paper, is the study of academic collaboration be-
tween different authors; we therefore look to learn
models for authors instead of only documents. Pop-
ular topic models for authors include the Author-
Topic Model (Rosen-Zvi et al, 2004), a simple
extension of regular LDA that adds an additional
author variable over the topics. The Author-Topic
Model learns a distribution over words for each
topic, as in regular LDA, as well as a distribution
over topics for each author. Alternatively, Labeled
LDA (Ramage et al, 2009), another LDA variation,
offers us the ability to directly model authors as top-
ics by considering them to be the topic labels for the
documents they author.
In this work, we use Labeled LDA to directly
model probabilistic term ?signatures? for authors. As
in (Hall et al, 2008) and (Gerrish and Blei, 2010),
we learn a new topic model for each year in the cor-
pus, allowing us to account for changing author in-
terests over time.
3 Computational Methodology
The experiments and results discussed in this paper
are based on a variation of the LDA topic model run
over data from the ACL corpus.
3.1 Dataset
We use the ACL anthology from years 1965 to 2009,
training over 12,908 papers authored by over 11,355
unique authors. We train our per year topic mod-
els over the entire dataset; however, when evaluating
our results, we are only concerned with papers that
were authored by multiple individuals as the other
papers are not collaborations.
3.2 Latent Mixture of Authors
Every abstract in our dataset reflects the work, to
some greater or lesser degree, of all the authors of
that work. We model these degrees explicitly us-
ing a latent mixture of authors model, which takes
its inspiration from the learning machinery of LDA
(Blei et al, 2003) and its supervised variant La-
beled LDA (Ramage et al, 2009). These models
assume that documents are as a mixture of ?topics,?
which themselves are probability distributions over
the words in the vocabulary of the corpus. LDA
is completely unsupervised, assuming that a latent
topic layer exists and that each word is generated
from one underlying topic from this set of latent top-
ics. For our purposes, we use a variation of LDA in
which we assume each document to be a latent mix-
ture of its authors. Unlike LDA, where each docu-
ment draws a multinomial over all topics, the latent
mixture of authors model we use restricts a docu-
ment to only sample from topics corresponding to
125
its authors. Also, unlike models such as the Author-
Topic Model (Rosen-Zvi et al, 2004), where au-
thors are modeled as distributions over latent top-
ics, our model associates each author to exactly one
topic, modeling authors directly as distributions over
words.
Like other topic models, we will assume a genera-
tive process for our collection of D documents from
a vocabulary of size V . We assume that each docu-
ment d has Nd terms and Md authors from a set of
authors A. Each author is described by a multino-
mial distribution ?a over words V , which is initially
unobserved. We will recover for each document a
hidden multinomial ?(d) of length Md that describes
which mixture of authors? best describes the doc-
ument. This multinomial is in turn drawn from a
symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter ?
restrict to the set of authors ?(d) for that paper. Each
document?s words are generated by first picking an
author zi from ?(d) and then drawing a word from
the corresponding author?s word distribution. For-
mally, the generative process is as follows:
? For each author a, generate a distribution ?a over
the vocabulary from a Dirichlet prior ?
? For each document d, generate a multinomial mix-
ture distribution ?(d) ? Dir(?.1?(d))
? For each document d,
? For each i ? {1, ..., Nd}
? Generate zi ? {?
(d)
1 , ..., ?
(d)
Md
} ?
Mult(?(d))
? Generate wi ? {1, ..., V } ?Mult(?zi)
We use Gibbs sampling to perform inference in
this model. If we consider our authors as a label
space, this model is equivalent to that of Labeled
LDA (Ramage et al, 2009), which we use for in-
ference in our model, using the variational objec-
tive in the open source implementation1. After in-
ference, our model discovers the distribution over
terms that best describes that author?s work in the
presence of other authors. This distribution serves
as a ?signature? for an author and is dominated by
the terms that author uses frequently across collabo-
rations. It is worth noting that this model constrains
the learned ?topics? to authors, ensuring directly in-
terpretable results that do not require the interpreta-
1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt/
tion of a latent topic space, such as in (Rosen-Zvi et
al., 2004).
To imbue our model with a notion of time, we
train a separate LLDA model for each year in the
corpus, training on only those papers written before
and during the given year. Thus, we have separate
?signatures? for each author for each year, and each
signature only contains information for the specific
author?s work up to and including the given year.
Table 1 contains examples of such term signatures
computed for two authors in different years. The top
terms and their fractional counts are displayed.
4 Studying Collaborations
There are several ways one can envision to differen-
tiate between types of academic collaborations. We
focus on three factors when creating collaboration
labels, namely:
? Presence of unestablished authors
? Similarity to established authors
? Number of established authors
If an author whom we know little about is present
on a collaborative paper, we consider him or her to
be a new author. We threshold new authors by the
number of papers they have written up to the pub-
lication year of the paper we are observing. De-
pending on whether this number is below or above a
threshold value, we consider an author to be estab-
lished or unestablished in the given year.
Similarity scores are measured using the trained
LLDA models described in Section 3.2. For any
given paper, we measure the similarity of the pa-
per to one of its (established) authors by calculating
the cosine similarity of the author?s signature in the
year preceding the paper?s publication to the paper?s
term-vector.
Using the aforementioned three factors, we define
the following types of collaborations:
? Apprenticeship Papers are authored by one or
more established authors and one or more un-
established authors, such that the similarity of
the paper to more than half of the established
authors is high. In this case, we say that the
new author (or authors) was an apprentice of

the established authors, continuing in their line
of work.
? New Blood Papers are authored by one estab-
lished author and one or more unestablished au-
thors, such that the similarity of the paper to the
established author is low. In this case, we say
that the new author (or authors) provided new
ideas or worked in an area that was dissimilar to
that which the established author was working
in.
? Synergistic Papers are authored only by es-
tablished authors such that it does not heavily
resemble any authors? previous work. In this
case, we consider the paper to be a product of
synergy of its authors.
? Catalyst Papers are similar to synergistic
ones, with the exception that unestablished au-
thors are also present on a Catalyst Paper. In
this case, we hypothesize that the unestablished
authors were the catalysts responsible for get-
ting the established authors to work on a topic
dissimilar to their previous work.
The decision diagram in Figure 1 presents an easy
way to determine the collaboration type assigned to
a paper.
5 Quantifying Collaborations
Following the decision diagram presented in Figure
1 and using similarity scores based on the values
returned by our latent author mixture models (Sec-
tion 3.2), we can deduce the collaboration type to
assign to any given paper. However, absolute cate-
gorization requires an additional thresholding of au-
thor similarity scores. To avoid the addition of an
arbitrary threshold, instead of directly categorizing
papers, we rank them based on the calculated sim-
ilarity scores on three different spectra. To facili-
tate ease of interpretation, the qualitative examples
we present are drawn from high PageRank papers as
calculated in (Radev et al, 2009).
5.1 The MaxSim Score
To measure the similarity of authors? previous work
to a paper, we look at the cosine similarity between
the term vector of the paper and each author?s term
signature. We are only interested in the highest co-
sine similarity score produced by an author, as our
categories do not differentiate between papers that
are similar to one author and papers that are sim-
ilar to multiple authors, as long as high similarity
to any single author is present. Thus, we choose
our measure, the MaxSim score, to be defined as:
max
a?est
cos(asig, paper)
We choose to observe the similarity scores only
for established authors as newer authors will not
have enough previous work to produce a stable term
signature, and we vary the experience threshold by
year to account for the fact that there has been a large
increase in the absolute number of papers published
in recent years.
Depending on the presence of new authors and
the number of established authors present, each pa-
per can be placed into one of the three spectra: the
Apprenticeship-New Blood spectrum, the Synergy
spectrum and the Apprenticeship-Catalyst spectrum.
Apprenticeship and Low Synergy papers are those
with high MaxSim scores, while low scores indicate
New Blood, Catalyst or High Synergy papers.
5.2 Examples
The following are examples of high impact papers
as they were categorized by our system:
127
Figure 1: Decision diagram for determining the collaboration type of a paper. A minimum of 1 established author is
assumed.
5.2.1 Example: Apprenticeship Paper
Improvements in Phrase-Based Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (2004)
by Richard Zens and Hermann Ney
This paper had a high MaxSim score, indicating high
similarity to established author Hermann Ney. This
categorizes the paper as an Apprenticeship Paper.
5.2.2 Example: New Blood Paper
Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using
Machine Learning Techniques (2002)
by Lillian Lee, Bo Pang and Shivakumar
Vaithyanathan
This paper had a low MaxSim score, indicating
low similarity to established author Lillian Lee.
This categorizes the paper as a New Blood Pa-
per, with new authors Bo Pang and Shivakumar
Vaithyanathan. It is important to note here that new
authors do not necessarily mean young authors or
grad students; in this case, the third author on the
paper was experienced, but in a field outside of
ACL.
5.2.3 Example: High Synergy Paper
Catching the Drift: Probabilistic Content
Models, with Applications to Generation and
Summarization (2003)
by Regina Barzilay and Lillian Lee
This paper had low similarity to both established
authors on it, making it a highly synergistic paper.
Synergy here indicates that the work done on this
paper was mostly unlike work previously done by
either of the authors.
5.2.4 Example: Catalyst Paper
Answer Extraction (2000)
by Steven Abney, Michael Collins, Amit Singhal
This paper had a very low MaxSim score, as well
as the presence of an unestablished author, making
it a Catalyst Paper. The established authors (from
an ACL perspective) were Abney and Collins, while
Singhal was from outside the area and did not have
many ACL publications. The work done in this pa-
per focused on information extraction, and was un-
like that previously done by either of the ACL estab-
lished authors. Thus, we say that in this case, Sing-
hal played the role of the catalyst, getting the other
two authors to work on an area that was outside of
their usual range.
5.3 Evaluation
5.3.1 Expert Annotation
To quantitatively evaluate the performance of
our system, we prepared a subset of 120 papers
from among the highest scoring collaborative papers
based on the PageRank metric (Radev et al, 2009).
Only those papers were selected which had at least a
128
single established author. One expert in the field was
asked to annotate each of these papers as being ei-
ther similar or dissimilar to the established authors?
prior work given the year of publication, the title of
the publication and its abstract.
We found that the MaxSim scores of papers la-
beled as being similar to the established authors
were, on average, higher than those labeled as dis-
similar. The average MaxSim score of papers anno-
tated as low MaxSim collaboration types (High Syn-
ergy, New Blood or Catalyst papers) was 0.15488,
while that of papers labeled as high MaxSim types
(Apprentice or Low Synergy papers) had a mean
MaxSim score of 0.21312. The MaxSim scores of
the different sets were compared using a t-test, and
the difference was found to be statistically signifi-
cant with a two-tailed p-value of 0.0041.
Framing the task as a binary classification prob-
lem, however, did not produce very strong results.
The breakdown of the papers and success rates (as
determined by a tuned threshold) can be seen in Ta-
ble 3. The system had a relatively low success rate of
62.5% in its binary categorization of collaborations.
5.3.2 First Author Prediction
Studies have suggested that authorship order,
when not alphabetical, can often be quantified and
predicted by those who do the work (Sekercioglu,
2008). Through a survey of all authors on a sam-
ple of papers, Slone (1996) found that in almost all
major papers, ?the first two authors are said to ac-
count for the preponderance of work?. We attempt
to evaluate our similarity scores by checking if they
are predictive of first author.
Though similarity to previous work is only a small
contributor to determining author order, we find that
using the metric of cosine similarity between author
signatures and papers performs significantly better
at determining the first author of a paper than ran-
dom chance. Of course, this feature alone isn?t ex-
tremely predictive, given that it?s guaranteed to give
an incorrect solution in cases where the first author
of a paper has never been seen before. To solve the
problem of first author prediction, we would have
to combine this with other features. We chose two
other features - an alphabetical predictor, and a pre-
dictor based on the frequency of an author appearing
as first author. Although we don?t show the regres-
Predictor Feature Accuracy
Random Chance 37.35%
Author Signature Similarity 45.23%
Frequency Estimator 56.09%
Alphabetical Ordering 43.64%
Table 2: Accuracy of individual features at predicting the
first author of 8843 papers
sion, we do explore these two other features and find
that they are also predictive of author order.
Table 2 shows the performance of our prediction
feature alongside the others. The fact that it beats
random chance shows us that there is some infor-
mation about authorial efforts in the scores we have
computed.
6 Applications
A number of questions about the nature of collabo-
rations may be answered using our system. We de-
scribe approaches to some of these in this section.
6.1 The Hedgehog-Fox Problem
From the days of the ancient Greek poet
Archilochus, the Hedgehog-Fox analogy has
been frequently used (Berlin, 1953) to describe two
different types of people. Archilochus stated that
?The fox knows many things; the hedgehog one big
thing.? A person is thus considered a ?hedgehog?
if he has expertise in one specific area and focuses
all his time and resources on it. On the other hand,
a ?fox? is a one who has knowledge of several
different fields, and dabbles in all of them instead of
focusing heavily on one.
We show how, using our computed similarity
scores, one can discover the hedgehogs and foxes
of Computational Linguistics. We look at the top
100 published authors in our corpus, and for each
author, we compute the average similarity score the
author?s signature has to each of his or her papers.
Note that we start taking similarity scores into ac-
count only after an author has published 5 papers,
thereby allowing the author to stablize a signature
in the corpus and preventing the signature from be-
ing boosted by early papers (where author similarity
would be artificially high, since the author was new).
We present the authors with the highest average
similarity scores in Table 4. These authors can be

Table 3: Evaluation based on annotation by one expert
considered the hedgehogs, as they have highly sta-
ble signatures that their new papers resemble. On
the other hand, Table 5 shows the list of foxes, who
have less stable signatures, presumably because they
move about in different areas.

6.2 Similarity to previous work by sub-fields
Based on the different types of collaborations dis-
cussed in, a potential question one might ask is
which sub-fields are more likely to produce appren-
tice papers, and which will produce new blood pa-
pers. To answer this question, we first need to deter-
mine which papers correspond to which sub-fields.
Once again, we use topic models to solve this prob-
lem. We first filter out a subset of the 1,200 highest
page-rank collaborative papers from the years 1980
to 2007. We use a set of topics built by running a
standard LDA topic model over the ACL corpus, in
which each topic is hand labeled by experts based on
the top terms associated with it. Given these topic-
term distributions, we can once again use the cosine
similarity metric to discover the highly associated

topics for each given paper from our smaller sub-
set, by choosing topics with cosine similarity above
a certain threshold ? (in this case 0.1).
Once we have created a paper set for each topic,
we can measure the ?novelty? for each paper by look-
ing at their MaxSim score. We can now find the av-
erage MaxSim score for each topic. This average
similarity score gives us a notion of how similar to
the established author (or authors) a paper in the sub
field usually is. Low scores indicate that new blood
and synergy style papers are more common, while
higher scores imply more non-synergistic or appren-
ticeship style papers. This could indicate that topics
with lower scores are more open ended, while those
with higher scores require more formality or train-
ing. The top five topics in each category are shown
in Tables 6 and 7. The scores of the papers from
the two tables were compared using a t-test, and the
difference in the scores of the two tables was found
to be very statistically significant with a two-tailed p
value << 0.01.

7 Discussion and Future Work
Once we have a robust way to score different kinds
of collaborations in ACL, we can begin to use these
scores as a quantitative tool to study phonemena in
the computational linguistics community. With our
current technique, we discovered a number of nega-
tive results; however, given that our accuracy in bi-
nary classification of categories is relatively low, we
cannot state for sure whether these are true negative
results or a limitation of our model.
7.1 Tentative Negative Results
Among the questions we looked into, we found the
following results:
? There was no signal indicating that authors
who started out as new blood authors were any
more or less likely to survive than authors who
started out as apprentices. Survival was mea-
sured both by the number of papers eventually
published by the author as well as the year of
the author?s final publication; however, calcu-
lations by neither measure correlated with the
MaxSim scores of the authors? early papers.
? Each author in the corpus was labeled for gen-
der. Gender didn?t appear to differentiate how
people collaborated. In particular, there was no
difference between men and women based on
how they started their careers. Women and men
are equally likely to begin as new blood authors
as they are to begin as apprentices.
? On a similar note, established male authors are
equally likely to partake in new blood or ap-
prentice collaborations as their female counter-
parts.
? No noticeable difference existed between aver-
age page rank scores of a certain categorization
of collaborative papers (e.g. high synergy pa-
pers vs. low synergy papers).
It is difficult to conclusively demonstrate negative
results, particularly given that our MaxSim scores
are by themselves not particularly strong discrimi-
nators in the binary classification tasks. We consider
these findings to be tentative and an opportunity to
explore in the future.
8 Conclusion
Not everything we need to know about academic
collaborations can be found in the co-authorship
graph. Indeed, as we have argued, not all types
of collaborations are equal, as embodied by differ-
ing levels of seniority and contribution from each
co-author. In this work, we have taken a first step
toward computationally modeling these differences
using a latent mixture of authors model and ap-
plied it to our own field, Computational Linguistics.
We used the model to examine how collaborative
works differ by authors and subfields in the ACL an-
thology. Our model quantifies the extent to which
some authors are more prone to being ?hedgehogs,?
whereby they heavily focus on certain specific ar-
eas, whilst others are more diverse with their fields
of study and may be analogized with ?foxes.?
We also saw that established authors in certain
subfields have more deviation from their previous
work than established authors in different subfields.
This could imply that the former fields, such as
?Sentiment Analysis? or ?Summarization,? are more
open to new blood and synergistic ideas, while other
latter fields, like ?Statistical Machine Translation?
or ?Speech Recognition? are more formal or re-
quire more training. Alternatively, ?Summarization?
or ?Sentiment Analysis? could just still be younger
fields whose language is still evolving and being in-
fluenced by other subareas.
This work takes a first step toward a new way of
thinking about the contributions of individual au-
thors based on their network of areas. There are
many design parameters that still exist in this space,
including alternative text models that take into ac-
count richer structure and, hopefully, perform bet-
ter at discriminating between the types of collabo-
rations we identified. We intend to use the ACL an-
thology as our test bed for continuing to work on tex-
tual models of collaboration types. Ultimately, we
hope to apply the lessons we learn on modeling this
familiar corpus to the challenge of answering large-
scale questions about the nature of collaboration as
embodied by large scale publication databases such
as ISI and Pubmed.
