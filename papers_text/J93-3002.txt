The problem of style is highly relevant o computational linguistics, but current systems deal 
only superficially, if at all, with subtle but significant nuances of language. Expressive ffects, 
together with their associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis and 
absent from generation. 
We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that is intended 
to eventually incorporate three selected components--lexical, syntactic, and semantic. In this 
paper, we concentrate on certain aspects of syntactic style. We have designed and implemented a 
computational theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various applications, including 
machine translation, second-language instruction, and natural anguage generation. 
We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and abstract elements 
of style. The primitive lements describe the stylistic effects of individual sentence components. 
These elements are combined into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the 
abstract elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects common to a group of 
sentences. Higher-level patterns are built from the abstract elements and associated with specific 
stylistic goals, such as clarity or concreteness. Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic stylistic 
grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive lements, abstract elements, and 
stylistic goals. Grammars for both English and French have been constructed, using the same 
vocabulary and the same development methodology. Parsers that implement these grammars have 
also been built. 
The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously defined only descrip- 
tively. The theory is being applied to various problems in which the form of an utterance conveys 
an essential part of meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood. 
1. Introduction 
1.1 An Advocacy of Style 
Understanding a text requires more than just understanding its propositional content. 
It requires a sensitivity to the interaction of semantic ontent, emotional expression, 
and interpersonal nd situational attitudes. This interaction is reflected in the style of 
the text. Style in language is not just surface appearance, a decorative veneer. Rather, it 
is an essential part of meaning, part of the author's communication to the reader. So to 
fully understand the nuances of a text, one must determine not only the propositional 
content, but also how its communicative effect is colored by the form, which reflects 
affective content. While propositional content provides the basic tone, the expressive

form provides the tonal quality. Together, form and content create style, that which 
distinguishes both an individual text and a collective body of writing. 
Style is created through subtle variation, seemingly minor modulations of exactly 
what is said, the words used to say it, and the syntactic onstructions employed, but 
the resulting effect on communication can be striking. Consider the following versions 
of the same text, Matthew 7:27: 
1. And descended the storm and came the floods and blew the winds and 
beat against hat house and it fell and the fall of it was great. (Literal 
translation of the Hellenistic Greek.) 
2. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. (Revised 
Standard Version, 1952.) 
3. The rain came down, the floods rose, the wind blew, and beat upon that 
house; down it fell with a great crash. (The New English Bible, 1970.) 
4. Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it 
fell; and what a fall it had! (The New Jerusalem Bible, 1985.) 
5. The rains fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and lashed against his 
house. It collapsed under all this and was completely ruined. (The New 
American Bible, 1973.) 
The first variation, a word-by-word translation from the Hellenistic Greek, is actually 
a good deal less striking than subsequent, widely accepted versions. The placement 
of the verbs before their subjects is quite normal and the closing is also quite usual. 
The sense of discord and resulting poetic effect is not as evident as it is in the second 
variation, from the Revised Standard Version, which is resoundingly poetic in the 
imitative form of the first five clauses, followed by the inverted form of the final clause. 
The text begins in strong concord and dissolves into discord, but not unpleasingly so. 
Discord, as we use the term in this paper, refers to a deviation from the norm, but such 
deviations can be used to good effect. As we will see, in language as in music, it is often 
through the construction of patterns of concord and discord, particular combinations 
of order and disorder that create an overall harmonious arrangement, that certain 
stylistic effects are achieved. 
In versions 3 and 4, the dramatic effect of the closing has been retained from the 
RSV translation but through different choices of words and structure. In 3, the last 
clause is inverted, but the translator has chosen to place more emphasis upon the 
fall itself (down it fell) than its magnitude (great). Example 4 ends on an intense note, 
achieved through the use of an exclamation (what a fall it had!), rather than an inversion 
of syntactic structure. And no single word expresses the degree of magnitude of the 
fall. In the final example, 5, the drama and intensity of the RSV has been lost with 
the removal of the dissolution from initial concord to final discord. In this case, the 
translator has opted for plainness and clarity, even at the expense of beauty. 
In English, example 1 sounds odd and disjointed; and examples 2, 3, and 4 are 
dramatic in a way that example 5 is not. But all have the same essential content. What 
then causes the differences in effect? What is being varied? There are at least four 
parameters that play a role in these stylistic variations: lexical, syntactic, thematic, and 
semantic aspects.

Lex ica l  aspects :  Compare xample 4 to the following constructed versions: 1 
6. Rain descended, floods rose, gales raged and beat upon that dwelling, 
and it collapsed; and what a fall it had! 
7. Rain fell, the water level rose, winds blew and hit that house, and it fell; 
and what a fall it had! 
The differences between 4, 6, and 7 are primarily lexical. Example 6 uses rather ele- 
gant words, while 7 opts for a more commonplace vocabulary, and 4 lies somewhere 
between the two in lexical formality. 
Syntax: Comparing example 2 to example 5, we see that the former uses syntactic 
structures that create more dramatic effects: a short climactic sentence, and it fell, and 
a striking inversion, great was the fall of it, close the text on a powerful note. In contrast, 
5 ends with a very ordinary, unremarkable, construction. 
Thematic aspects: Comparing example 2 to example 3, we observe that the two sen- 
tence structures bring different elements into focus: great was the fall of it, in contrast 
to down it fell with a great crash. In general, variations in thematic structure can create 
different stylistic effects. 
Semant ics :  The exact choice of what is said, or not said, also has stylistic onsequences. 
Compare xample 4 to the following two constructed versions: 
. 
. 
A serious torm, with rain and gales and floods, struck that house, 
which collapsed. 
Rain fell and fell and eventually caused a flood, which rose up to that 
house; also the winds kept blowing until eventually the combined forces 
of rain, flood, and wind were too great and caused so much structural 
damage that the house collapsed. 
These variations differ in their semantic ontent: example 4 merely reports the events, 
but 8 evaluates, a serious storm, while 9 emphasizes technical details, structural damage. 
These semantic differences are reflected in the texts; and stylistic differences result. 
Given that these four parameters--lexical hoice, syntax, theme, and semantics-- 
control stylistic variations, two questions arise: 
? How do we characterize each type of variation? 
? How does each variation contribute to an overall stylistic effect? 
In considering these questions in this paper, we will concentrate on variations of the 
syntactic parameter. 
We emphasize that our intent here is not any form of literary analysis or literary 
theory. Our main concern will be ordinary, everyday text. It is true that, in the Biblical 
texts above, we saw how different syntactic forms carry different stylistic import o the 
point that one form may be poetry while another is just dull, plodding prose. But style 
1 We thank Eduard Hovy for constructing examples 6 through 9.
453 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
isn't just a matter of achieving poetry or not. Every text, large or small, interesting or 
dull, effective or not, has its own style. Nor are we talking about style in any of its 
normative senses: the common tenets dictating standard forms (e.g., Chicago 1982), or 
the textbook prescriptions for 'good' style: be clear, be simple, be precise (e.g., Strunk 
and White 1979). For people aim to convince, to persuade, to impress, and, even, 
sometimes to obscure, and standard textbooks tell us very little about such varied and 
subtle stylistic and pragmatic goals. 
Rather than a study of literary or normative style, our intent is to determine 
what gives any ordinary piece of text its stylistic 'feel.' The following examples will 
demonstrate what we have in mind. These texts are all from newspaper feature articles: 
10. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50% a shrew falsely mellowed by 
religion, promptly organized prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware 
meetings. 2 
11. The artist provides a dreamy background one in yellow and bistre 
brushstrokes to a blue gown with woodenly rigid folds or the profile of 
a brown angel painted so mineral hard and modeled so carefully that the 
incoherence of virtue does it injury. 3
12. Crazed with fear, he tried to purify her by dunking her in the ocean and 
holding her under the water; then in desperation he threw her on the 
still-smoking pyreo 4
In a newspaper, we might have expected the writer and translator to have simply 
aimed for clarity. In fact, we find a variety of effects. The first text, 10, emphasizes a 
sense of harmony by repeating the same kind of structure, a nominal group, in the 
postmodification f Silvia. The second, 11, is more complex, and achieves a certain 
balance in the judicious use of conjunctions; but the result is so difficult o understand 
that it doesn't really make sense. Text 12 has a stark initial participle clause, crazed 
with fear, that emphasizes the intensity of the subject's emotional state. 
To account for the kinds of complex stylistic effects that occur even in everyday 
writing, we propose a goal-directed understanding of style. That is, an author's in- 
tent can vary with respect o a number of stylistic goals, such as clarity or obscurity, 
abstraction or concreteness, taticness or dynamism. Particular choices of words, syn- 
tactic structure, and semantic structure make a text more--or less--stylistically varied 
and effective. We believe that these choices, goals such as abstraction or concreteness, 
and the stylistic elements that are used to realize them can be recognized and repre- 
sented in a formal notation. They are, in a word, codifiable. It is this codification that 
is at the heart of computational stylistics. S 
1.2 The Function of Style 
Propositional content alone is insufficient to determine the nature and form of a sen- 
tence (Halliday 1985; McDonald and Pustejovsky 1985; Jameson 1987; Hovy 1988; Scott

5 The term computational stylistics has been used by Milic (1982) to describe what might better be called 
computer-aided stylistics, in which computer-generated data and pattern-matching aid human analysis 
and judgment of style in literary studies (see Section 2.2). In contrast, our use of the term entails fully 
automatic omputer analysis of the style of any kind of text. 
454 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
and de Souza 1990). Even after the propositional content has been decided upon, there 
are still many linguistic, syntactic, and even semantic decisions that the language pro- 
ducer must make before a sentence can be formed. These decisions are assumed by 
the audience not to have been made randomly, but rather in specific, deliberate ways 
that encode additional information, such as opinion, emotional affect, and interper- 
sonal relationships. 6 To the extent hat a piece of text exhibits a particular, recognizable 
style, it also reflects the author 's  presumed intent to convey the effect associated with 
that style. Therefore, full understanding of a text must represent not only propositional 
content, but also stylistic effects. 
This becomes most apparent in the case of machine translation. If a translation is 
to be faithful, the stylistic effects of the source language text must be transferred to the 
target language text, making appropriate use of the stylistic conventions of the target 
language. But a di lemma arises: 
? One wants to preserve the original author 's  tylistic intent, the 
information being conveyed through the manner of presentation. 
However, different languages might realize this effect in different ways. 
So the source and target texts should both aim for the author 's  stylistic 
goal, but might have to achieve it through different linguistic means. 7
? Yet one wants to produce a text whose style is appropriate and natural 
to the particular target language. Languages differ as to the most 
'natural '  way to express an idea. For example, French tends to prefer 
more abstraction, English more concreteness (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958). 
The best translation, therefore, might modify the original author 's  tylistic 
intent and express a different effect. 
Sometimes, there is no way to resolve this di lemma, and one is left with an unsat- 
isfactory translation. But, with a knowledge of the comparative stylistics of a language 
pair, and of the stylistic resources of each language and the possible range of effects 
they can create, one can substantially improve the quality of a translation. 
1.3 The Structure of the Paper 
Our goal is to create a formal representation of stylistics for use in natural language 
systems, and, moreover, to do so in a manner applicable to different languages. The 
solution we will propose is a codification of syntactic stylistic knowledge in the form 
of a stylistic grammar. 
In the next section, we will review the current status of the codification of style. 
In Section 3, we will construct a vocabulary for stylistics. The definition of concepts 
and the attempt o organize them into a recognizable structure is a necessary first step 
toward understanding the problem. Then we will develop in Section 4 a methodology 
for converting stylistic knowledge into a formal representation. The methodology will 
6 Thus the speaker or writer is accountable forhis or her stylistic decisions, in the sense that that term is 
used in Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis. A person encountering friends on the street, 
for example, may choose to greet hem or not, but is held accountable either way--failure to greet is a 
snub; it is not possible to opt out of the situation altogether (Heritage 1984). Similarly, a speaker or 
writer is accountable for all the stylistic nuances of his or her utterances; it is not possible to utter a 
sentence in such a way that only the propositional content counts and not the form in which it is 
expressed. 
7 "Economy is expressed at two levels, lexical and syntactic, which may, however, be related: what is 
expressed lexically in one language may be realized through syntactic means in the other, and vice 
versa" (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958, p. 185, authors" translation). 
455 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
be as general as possible, ideally applicable to the codification of style for the sen- 
tence and paragraph levels; appropriate for lexical, syntactic, and semantic style; and 
applicable to both English and French. The methodology will be used in conjunction 
with the stylistic vocabulary to guide the systematic collection and creation of stylistic 
rules. This grammar will provide a formal description of the syntactic patterns that 
differentiate he various stylistic goals. 
In addition to theoretical problems, there are implementation issues to be ad- 
dressed as well. In Section 5, we will describe the development of a stylistic parser that 
uses the formal bodies of rules to analyze complex English text. 
In the last section, we will review the contributions of the paper and discuss 
completed and ongoing extensions to the research. 
2. Background to the Study of Style 
2.1 Views of Style 
2.1.1 The Classical View. The study of style has an ancient history, for the concept 
first appeared in the fifth century B.C. Scholars of the time conceived the notion that 
the rhetorical form of a writer's text should reflect his thoughts and intentions. This 
was to be achieved through the appropriate choice and organization of words and 
syntactic structures in order to "evoke the desired response" (Corbett 1971). Content 
and form were recognized as inseparable, and as exerting a reciprocal influence upon 
each other. 
Beginning with Corax of Syracuse, rhetoricians developed methods for systematic 
instruction in the art of writing. The classical scholars, from Isocrates and Aristotle 
to Cicero and Quintilian, established standards of rhetoric that influenced curricula 
for centuries. The contribution of Aristotle was particularly notable. He countered 
Plato's argument that rhetoric was mere sophistry, deceitful reasoning, by providing a
system of instruction that treated the theory and practice of style as a valid discipline, 
designed to appeal simultaneously to reason and emotion. 
This classical approach to style flourished into the Middle Ages, for it formed part 
of a standard university education. The teaching of formal rhetoric in schools and 
universities continued to play a significant role throughout the Renaissance and into 
the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to 
the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic 
prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory 
that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in 
writing (Corbett 1971). 
2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity 
to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk 
and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal 
and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some 
degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the 
expression of a writer's individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used, 
we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear 
writing, but not as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text. 
2.1.3 Our View. In computational pplications, where we expect o deal with large 
amounts of similar types of text, the analysis of group style is of more interest than the 
idiosyncratic style of any one writer. Group style can be subdivided into two major 
types, each associated with a different view of stylistics: literary style and utilitarian 
456 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
(or functional) style. Utilitarian group styles are distinguished from the literary type by 
their association with a genre of text that has a particular function or purpose, such as 
medical textbooks or political newspaper writing. In such styles, the writer adjusts her 
language to what readers expect in a specific situation. The fact that functional group 
styles are somewhat more restrictive than literary group styles, as they are characteristic 
of a particular genre, suggests that the problem of codifying utilitarian style will be 
more tractable than the literary case. For this reason, we will focus on utilitarian texts 
in general, drawing most of our examples from newspaper and magazine journalism. 
(Our main source of examples is the English translations, published in The Guardian 
Weekly, 8of articles from Le Monde.) 
2.2 The Current State of Computational Stylistics 
Most of the research to date in computational stylistics has been the development 
of so-called style-checkers. The UNix-based Writer's Workbench, Grammatik I and II, 
RightWriter, PC-Style, Punctuation and Style, Electric Webster, and CRITIQUE are ex- 
amples (Raskin 1986). However, none of these systems is appropriate for our purposes. 
These programs enforce the basic virtues: be clear, be simple, be precise. They merely 
check for common grammatical errors such as number disagreement, pronoun case 
problems, unbalanced punctuation, split infinitives, excessive sentence length, and ex- 
cessive sentence complexity. There is no systematic approach to constructing a vocab- 
ulary of style, no structured representation f stylistic rules. Stylistic knowledge may 
simply consist, as in the case of CRITIQUE, of an unstructured mass of rules (Jensen 
et al 1986, p. 190). These programs have no real understanding of the significance of 
stylistic parameters. 
The other main kind of computational research in stylistics has been statistical (e.g., 
Cluett 1976, 1990; Milic 1982; Biber 1988, 1989). With this approach, a count is made of 
the number of occurrences in a sample text of a stylistically significant feature, such 
as an initial prepositional phrase. A statistical analysis is done to compare the count 
and type of stylistic features with the corresponding parameters of texts written by 
authors working in the same or different genres. But the interpretation of the statistical 
results must be done by a human; the computer system has no real understanding of
what the variations in style mean. 
Although virtually all computational research in stylistics takes a non-AI approach 
to the representation a d use of stylistic knowledge, the usefulness and degree of so- 
phistication of some of these programs hould not be underestimated. The York Com- 
puter Inventory of Prose Style (Cluett 1976, 1990) has been undergoing development 
since 1970. The principal contribution of the project is its convincing demonstration 
that the richness and subtlety of literary style could in fact be correlated, to a perhaps 
surprising degree of accuracy, with a catalog of syntactic patterns. But the program 
that performs the stylistic analysis has no understanding of the meaning of its statis- 
tical results; it relies on human interpretation of the statistics computed. Nevertheless, 
the York project's findings are still very useful, as they have catalogued the syntactic 
features that produce particular stylistic effects. 
Thus, most current approaches in computational stylistics have not included for- 
mal stylistic rules, which are clearly a desirable prerequisite. We now review the extent 
to which such rules have been developed in theoretical stylistics and used in compu- 
tational stylistics.

l'anglais, is somewhat misleading, for their purpose was not just to deal with com- 
parative stylistics in translation, but also to enumerate the more common rules and 
procedures in the overall translation process. But they did not construct a specific vo- 
cabulary for comparative stylistics and, in fact, virtually all of their 'stylistic' terms refer 
to basic syntactic onstituents. Using their vocabulary of terms, Vinay and Darbelnet 
defined rules, expressed in ordinary natural anguage, that encoded knowledge about 
French-English comparative stylistics. The rules certainly fell short of the repertoire 
needed by a professional translator, but no one has yet improved upon their codi- 
fication of comparative stylistics (Brian Fitch, personal communication). Their book 
is still used as a prescribed text in translation courses. Vinay and Darbelnet did not 
take an explicitly goal-directed approach, but their book does contain a great deal of 
information about the correlation of stylistic goals with particular lexical, syntactic, 
and semantic hoices. Unfortunately, however, their rules proved to be too language- 
dependent for the framework that is proposed in this paper. But the success of a 
goal-directed codification, albeit an implicit one, supports the approach that we will 
take below. 
Crystal and Davy (1969) hypothesized the creation of a formal stylistic grammar, 
built upon a vocabulary of stylistic terms and intended to represent he sentence 
structures characteristic of a particular stylistic sublanguage. However, the grammar 
that they sketched contained virtually no terms other than purely syntactic ones and 
no correlations with stylistic goals; it was only a first step, although an ambitious 
one, toward a codification of the stylistic rules that define a sublanguage. What we 
have found especially useful to adapt from their work is the overall methodology, the 
approach to formalizing style, even the belief that style can be formalized. 
Kane's (1983) rhetoric and handbook of style represents the typical textbook that 
aims to teach the rules of classic good writing. Kane, too, did not take an explicitly 
goal-directed approach in his stylistic rules, but nevertheless gave numerous references 
to the stylistic goals associated with particular syntactic structures. The systematic con- 
struction of a stylistic vocabulary seems not to have been an explicit goal, but he used 
many terms unique to stylistics. However, his terminology was apparently augmented 
whenever the need arose to describe a new feature; there was no underlying struc- 
ture, no formal representation f rules. The stylistic rules were expressed in ordinary 
English and achieved, as the author intended, good coverage of plain writing style. 
This body of rules was 'structured' to the extent hat there were hierarchies of stylistic 
sentence types, but, in general, Kane's rules appear to be just an enumeration of stylis- 
tic tenets, not a deliberately constructed organization. Nevertheless, we have found 
it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic overage of our 
grammar. 
In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest o us is ma- 
chine translation (MT). In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT, 
Loffier-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group 
styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each 
language. Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic 
differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT. An impor- 
tant contribution of Tsutsumi's work is the recognition that computational stylistics 
is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language 
group. 
Hovy's (1988) PAULINE system was the first computational system that imple- 
mented goal-directed style. PAULINE was able to generate text that conformed to vari- 
ous stylistic and pragmatic onstraints that it was given. The system was goal-directed, 
able to correlate such stylistic goals as formality, simplicity, and respect with the lexical 
458 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
and syntactic haracteristics of the text produced. Hovy's method was based on the 
definition of rhetorical goals of style, such as formality, force, and partiality, that control 
broader pragmatic goals. For example, a low degree of formality combined with high 
degrees of force and partiality gives a 'no-nonsense' ffect. 
To achieve a particular hetorical goal, PAULINE examined the options at various 
points during the production of text and applied the appropriate strategies. For ex- 
ample, to achieve formality, the generator would perform the following actions: 
Organization of topics: Make long complex sentences by subordinating them in 
relative clauses or by conjoining two or more sentence topics. 
Organization of sentences: Make sentences seem weighty by including a number 
of adverbial clauses, by placing these clauses toward the beginning of a 
sentence, by building parallel clauses, by using the passive voice, by using 
more 'complex' tenses uch as the perfect enses, and by avoiding ellipsis. 
Choice of words and phrases: Select formal words and phrases. Avoid doubtful 
grammar, popular idioms, slang, and contractions. 
Although structured in its correlation of the generator's actions with decision points, 
this approach to representing a goal-directed knowledge of style is essentially heuristic. 
Hovy's success in implementing a goal-based notion of style, even though lim- 
ited in scope and informal in the mode of knowledge representation, encouraged our 
development of a computational pproach to goal-directed style. 
2.3 Summary 
? From existing research in theoretical stylistics, we have seen that there is 
a basis for the codification of group-based, utilitarian, goal-directed 
stylistics. 
? The need for a vocabulary of stylistic terms is an accepted idea. 
However, the nature and structure of such a vocabulary for 
computational use, which must describe more than basic syntax and be 
amenable to systematic construction, have not yet been addressed. These 
issues will be subjects of the next section. 
? Similarly, while large bodies of stylistic rules already exist, they have not 
been organized into the formal structure necessary to a computational 
approach. Section 4 will develop a structured method for representing 
stylistic rules by constructing formal grammars. 
? The feasibility of a goal-directed analysis of style is supported by 
previous research, but an actual goal-based codification has not 
previously been attempted. In the grammar that we will develop in 
Section 4, we will incorporate such a goal-directed knowledge of 
stylistics. 
3. A Vocabulary of Style 
3.1 Stylistic Goals 
If we hope to build AI-based systems to deal with matters of style, then we must 
provide a formal knowledge representation: we need a vocabulary of well-defined, 
expressive terms that will allow our intuitions about style to be stated precisely and 
459 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
understood clearly. We will construct a vocabulary from terms that are associated with 
utilitarian, group-based, goal-directed stylistics. We will start by considering the kinds 
of stylistic goals to be dealt with in the lexicon. 
When a writer composes text, she has certain stylistic goals in mind; such goals 
might include clarity, or informality, or even the clouding of an unpalatable message. 
To achieve her various goals, she will choose specific words (outplacement or firing, 
for example), syntactic onstructions (heavily modified or sparse noun phrases), and 
semantic organization (Thirty percent of the class failed or The majority of students passed). 
In applications uch as machine translation, we want to understand why a writer 
has used language in a particular way, what specific effects she intended to convey, 
and which linguistic choices were made to achieve these goals. There are a multitude 
of goals that could be considered; indeed, the space of possibilities has never been 
fully explored. For this study, we have chosen six goals that Vinay and Darbelnet 
(1958) consider to be among the most commonly used, representing the opposite nds 
of three dimensions. The goals are listed as follows, with an intuitive description of 
the corresponding characteristics that a sentence of each type would display: 
? Clarity: Simplicity, harmony, and no ambiguity. 
Obscurity: Complexity, incongruity, and difficulty of understanding. 
? Concreteness: Specificity, with an emphasis on certain components. 
Abstraction: Generality, with no particular emphasis on any one 
sentence component. 
? Staticness: Uniformity, predictability, continuity. 
Dynamism: Deviation from the norm, unexpectedness, action. 
3.2 From Theoretical Stylistics to Computational Stylistics 
We will now develop a vocabulary of basic terms that will describe stylistically sig- 
nificant aspects of syntax. Our development is guided by much in classical rhetorical 
theory; often, our definitions will be extensions of those of the classical theory. We do 
this in two stages: first, we outline abstract properties of style suggested by classical 
rhetoric; second, we convert hese properties into definitions of abstract elements that 
will be used in a grammar of style. 
Our starting point is the notion of stylistic norm, which is defined as the most 
commonly used structures in a given genre. This notion is intrinsic to the work of the 
majority of descriptive stylists uch as Crystal and Davy (1969) and Cluett (1976, 1990). 
From this, we derive the notions of stylistic concord and discord as the fundamental 
principles of our formalization. Concord simply means conformity with the norm, and 
discord, deviation from the norm. 
Each genre has its own particular norm; for example, the style characteristic of 
scientific texts may seem disruptive if used in general newspaper writing. This view 
goes beyond the tenet of prescriptive rhetoric that the stylistic norm merely represents 
standard, 'good,' style, independent of the use of the text. Rather, we agree with 
Lanham (1974) that style should be viewed as the tailoring of a text to a specific 
audience and a specific situation; 'good' style can in fact be quite inappropriate. 
The concept of norm will be useful as a means of anchoring the development of
our stylistic rules. It is simply the usual, the typical, the stable and concordant. Indeed, 
discord, deviation from the norm, will play an essential role in our formalization of 
style, for it is our contention that style arises from the construction of patterns of 
460 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
concord and discord, particular combinations of order and disorder that create an 
overall harmonious arrangement (Crystal and Davy 1969; Cluett 1976, 1990). 
3.2.1 The Divisions of the Vocabulary. As the first step in constructing a vocabulary 
of style for computational use, we will look at the descriptive terms that stylists have 
developed over many centuries of use. 
One of the most important rhetorical influences on sentence style that has been 
identified is syntactic parallelism, or coordination: the balancing of syntactically similar 
forms to achieve a harmonious stylistic effect, an idea dating back to the rhetorical 
schemes of balance (Corbett 1971, p. 463). 
But if parallelism or coordination plays an important role in style, so too does 
subordination: variations in the hierarchical structure of a sentence that can produce 
correspondingly different stylistic effects. One part of a sentence can dominate an- 
other. As with parallelism, the importance to style of syntactic hierarchy is also a 
well-established principle in classical rhetoric, evident in the schemes of parenthesis, 
apposition, and climax (Corbett 1971, pp. 466, 468, 476). Thus, modulations in coordinate 
and subordinate structure are major factors in achieving stylistic expressiveness. 
A third major contributor to syntactic style is linear ordering: varying the order 
of components within a sentence to produce quite marked stylistic differences. The 
rhetorical terms of anastrophe and parenthesis (Corbett 1971, p. 466) attest o the stylistic 
importance of the ordering of sentence components. 
Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are: 
? Balance: Parallelism of structure. 
? Dominance: Structural hierarchy. 
? Position: Linear ordering of structure. 
We will adapt hese factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary 
of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups 
in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each 
group. 
3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms ymmetric 
construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), 
balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969). 
All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar 
clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use 
of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), 
and intrasentence oordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar struc- 
tures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) 
or syntactic ounterpoint (Hendricks 1976). These types of structures are most often in- 
terrupted or convoluted sentences (Kane 1983). For inclusion in our vocabulary, we will 
choose the most representative terms in the balance group: intersentence oordination 
and intrasentence ounterpoint. 
There are a variety of terms that can be classified into the dominance group. First, 
there are sentences that have one trivially dominant clause. These are the simple sen- 
tences (Kane 1983) that have only one main, or central, clause with no subordinate 
clauses. Next, there are many and varied types of sentences built up around a central, 
dominant clause. The complex sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause and at least 
one dependent clause. The loose sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause followed by 
461 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
a subordinate clause. The centered sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause flanked by 
subordinate clauses. The cumulative sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause accom- 
panied by a series of appositive, modifying, or absolute constructions. Finally, there 
are more-complicated sentences with more than one dominant clause. The compound- 
complex sentence (Kane 1983) can be much more elaborate than a simple compound 
sentence, as it contains at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent 
clause. For inclusion in our vocabulary, we abstract from these three types of hierarchi- 
cal terms to identify trivial single-clause dominance, complex single-clause dominance, 
and multiple-clause dominance. 
The position group appears to contain the largest number of terms, as any basic 
term can be qualified to an arbitrarily fine degree by the exact intrasentence position to 
which it refers. We will use only three qualifiers, associated with initial, medial, and final 
positions (Quirk et al 1985). At the sentence l vel, we can have any word or phrase in 
initial, medial, or final position. Within the sentence, there are almost infinite variations 
of position terms. A small sample includes postpositive adjectives, and pre-verbal, post- 
verbal, or post-clause adverbs (Crystal and Davy 1969), and complex premodification and 
postmodification (Crystal and Davy 1969). We will generalize from these many subtle 
variations and define terms that have either a concordant or discordant effect, at a 
particular position in a sentence, according to whether or not their usage is normal. 
From this grouping of terms into the three divisions of balance, dominance, and 
position, we have abstracted general properties of style that we want to describe in 
our vocabulary. The abstract elements of style that we will now define will classify the 
unstructured mass of stylistically significant sentence types into groups of sentences 
with similar stylistic properties. 
3.3 Abstract Elements of Style 
We will present the abstract elements in three groups, according to their properties of 
balance, dominance, and position, which we now define formally as follows: 
Balance: A balance term characterizes a tylistic effect created by the juxtaposition 
of similar or dissimilar sentence components. 
For example, parallelism in sentence structure is the juxtaposition of syn- 
tactically similar components. 
Dominance: A dominance t rm describes a stylistic effect created by the particular 
hierarchical structure of a sentence. 
In a simple sentence, for example, there is an effect of simplicity associated 
with the single and therefore, by default, dominant clause. 
Position: A position term describes a stylistic effect created by the particular place- 
ment of a syntactic omponent within a sentence. 
For example, in English, a postmodifying adjective, as in the house ablazG can 
be more emphatic than the more usual premodifying type, as in the blazing 
house. 
Now we shall propose a set of stylistic terms, correlated with this classification, 
that will make explicit those abstract stylistic properties that are now only implicit 
in existing terminology. These stylistic terms will be based on effects of concord and 
discord, which we formally define as follows: 
Concord: A stylistic onstruction that conforms to the norm for a given genre. 
462 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
Discord: A stylistic construction that deviates from the norm. 
We will now use these notions to define abstract elements that are related, in turn, to 
effects of balance, dominance, and position. 
3.3.1 Balance Elements. The first group of abstract elements is related to effects of 
balance within a sentence. Here, we will be looking at relationships that tend to either 
perturb or reinforce the balance of a sentence. The first and simplest ype of balance 
element is a homopoise ("same weight"): 
Homopoise: A sentence with interclausal coordination of syntactically similar 
components. 
In other words, there are one or more stylistic 'shapes' in a homopoisal sentence, each 
contributing the same type of effect to the concordant parallelism of the sentence. In 
the example below, two very simple clauses, with identically shaped parse trees, are 
conjoined: 
13. The style was formed and the principles were acquired. 9 
Sentences that are more complex can have their balance interrupted or perturbed 
by a heteropoisal ("different weight") component: 
Heteropoise: A sentence in which one or more parenthetical components are syn- 
tactically 'detached' and dissimilar from the other components at the same 
level in the parse tree. 
It is difficult to formally characterize this class of structures and the underlying notion 
of a component being 'detached.' Quirk et al (1985) also rely on this word to define 
what they call disjuncts but make no attempt o define it: 
Disjuncts .. .  have a superior role as compared with the sentence l- 
ements; they are syntactically more detached and in some respects 
'superordinate,' in that they seem to have a scope that extends over 
the sentence as a whole. (Quirk et al 1985, p. 613) l? 
Similarly, Nunberg (1990), in defining the related idea of the delimiter comma, can do 
no better than to characterize the class "in a rough way": 
There is the class of elements delimited by commas, either at both ends 
(when the elements occur clause-internally) or at one end (roughly, 
when the elements are either clause-initial or -final) \[p. 36\] . . . .  It is 
obviously not possible here to provide an analysis of the syntax and 
semantics of each of these constructions, much less to try to charac- 
terize them in such a way as to say what they have in common. In 
a rough way, however, we observe that they all involve constituency 
9 Adapted from The Manchester Guardian Weekly, 14 February 1988, p. 15. 
10 An example of a disjunct is the interrupting prepositional phrase in all frankness in the sentence Your son 
is not, in all frankness, ucceeding inhis present job (Quirk et al 1985, p. 612). 
463 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
problems, so that they do not behave as constituents, for example, 
under such tests as verb-phrase llipsis. What is more, all of them 
can be characterized as supplying material that is communicatively 
supererogatory to the bare propositional content of the lexical clause 
in which they appear... .  This is all very rough, but it does suggest 
that the content of these comma-delimited lements plays a distinctive 
role in the representation f the \[rhetorical\] argument structure of the 
text. \[pp. 38-39\] 
Despite the difficulty of formal characterization, we agree with Quirk et al and 
Nunberg that there is an intuitively clear class of constructions here, and, like these 
authors, hope that it can be conveyed to the reader by sufficient use of examples. 
We divide the class of heteropoise sentences into three types, depending upon the 
position of the parenthetical component: a heteropoise may be medial, initial, or final. 
Moreover, we will distinguish between two subtypes at each position: concordant and 
discordant. 
Medial heteropoise: A heteropoise in which the parenthetical component is in 
medial position. 
Concordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the 
parenthetical component is cohesively linked to the rest of the sen- 
tence. (This notion will be made precise when we have introduced 
the primitive lements in Section 3.4.) 
Discordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the 
parenthetical component is not cohesively linked to the rest of the 
sentence. 
In example 14 below, the relative clause which brought no protests interrupts the main 
clause, yet, as a postmodifier, it is still a part of the subject noun phrase and so the 
sentence isa concordant medial heteropoise. But now consider the medial adverbial phrase 
according to a company spokesman; as a sentence modifier, it is quite detached from the 
rest of the sentence and so the sentence is simultaneously a discordant medial heteropoise: 
14. The measure, which brought no protests, was decided, according to a 
company spokesman, because of the dangers to which these employees 
are exposed in travelling to particularly exposed subtropical countries, u 
Initial heteropoise" A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the paren- 
thetical component is in initial position. 
Sentence 15 contains an initial parenthesis, an appositive noun phrase, that is cohe- 
sively linked to the rest of the sentence because it refers to the subject of the main 
clause. Thus, the sentence is a concordant initial heteropoise: 
15. The heir to a fortune, her friend did not care about passing 
examinations. 12

12 Quirk et al (1985, p. 1314). 
464 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
Final heteropoise: A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the paren- 
thetical component is in final position. 
Sentence 16 contains a final parenthesis, an 'extraneous' phrase, that is distinct from 
the main clause, as it is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence. Thus, the 
sentence is a discordant final heteropoise: 
16. Stephen and Jennifer are not going to buy the house, according to a 
spokesman. 
We saw in 14 that a heteropoise can contain more than one parenthetical, and one 
of them might be concordant while another is discordant. Likewise, it can be the case 
that one parenthetical is, say, medial, while another is initial or final. The following 
example shows two successive medial parentheticals rather stridently interrupting the 
main text--the ffect is heightened by the use of dashes--as well as a final parenthetical 
in the same sentence: 
17. The idea of combined French and British patrols by nuclear 
submarines--a proposal once made by the Social Democrat 
leader David Owen-- let  alone the plan for "sharing the work" 
where the targets and missiles carried by these submarines are 
concerned was not even raised, according to a French military 
spokesman. 13
3.3.2 Dominance Elements. The second type of abstract element deals with stylis- 
tic dominance, which is concerned with the hierarchical structure of a sentence. A
common type of dominance lement is the monoschematic, a very simple sentence: 
Monoschematic: A sentence with a single main clause with simple phrasal sub- 
ordination and no accompanying subordinate or coordinate clauses. 
Here is an example of a canonical monoschematic sentence: 
18. Posterity has not been kind to him. 14 
The most common dominance lement in the texts that we have studied is the 
centroschematic: 
Centroschematic: A sentence with a central, dominant clause with one or more 
of the following optional features: complex phrasal subordination, initial 
dependent clauses, final dependent clauses. 
Centroschematic sentences can be quite varied in structure, but their shared charac- 
teristic is a predominant component that serves as the organizational center for all 
other components. Such structures are built with subordination and coordination. In 
13 Manchester Guardian Weekly, 7 February 1988, p. 13. 
14 Adapted from The Manchester Guardian Weekly, 14 February 1988, p. 15. 
465 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
the first example below, the main clause is supported by a complex, but subordinate 
and coordinate, relative clause structure: 
19. Neither these devices nor the cramped viewing rooms which are too 
narrow and whose ceilings are much too low for the big altarpieces 
manage to spoil the works. 15 
Two subordinate clauses, the first of them adverbial and the second of them relative, 
accompany but do not dominate the main clause in the following sentence: 
20. Not all that long ago, the famous collector Charles de Bestegui, 
when unable to get hold of certain paintings, was quite prepared to 
adorn the walls of his Venetian palace with copies, which happily 
rubbed shoulders with his numerous genuine canvases. 16
Finally, the complex but imitative postmodification in the next example incorporates 
a substantial amount of information without weakening the dominance of the main 
clause: 
21. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50's, a shrew falsely mellowed by 
religion, promptly organised prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware 
meetings. 17
Given that we have a progression in complexity from monoschematic to cen- 
troschematic sentences, a natural extension is to the polyschematic: 
Polysehematic: A sentence with more than one central dominant clause and at 
least one dependent clause. 
Such sentences occur much less frequently than the monoschematic or centroschematic 
varieties, at least in the corpus used in this research. However, a sentence with obvi- 
ously disparate components occasionally occurs, as in the following example. There are 
two dominant clauses (we could th ink . . ,  and we should not forget . . .  ) and a dependent 
clause (if we consider the progress . . .  ): 
22. If we consider the progress already achieved, the opposition that had to 
be overcome, for example, in order to open schools for girls, and the fact 
that Saudi Arabia is less than 60 years old, we could think that time will 
permit resolving the contradictions between the most liberal aspirations 
of one part of society and the ulemas' determination to keep the country 
as it is, and we should not forget o mention the Islamic fundamentalist 
movements which are threatening Saudi Arabia. TM

3.3.3 Position Elements. The third group of abstract elements that we will look at are 
the position elements. The most common types of position element describe concordant 
or discordant stylistic effects in particular positions. Thus, we have initial concord, medial 
concord, and final concord. Similarly, we have a range of discord elements. The definitions 
of these elements are closely tied to the primitive-level descriptions of our vocabulary, 
so we will delay their precise characterizations until Section 3.5, after the primitive- 
level descriptions are introduced. Here, it will be sufficient for the reader to know 
only that the concords describe constructions, at a particular position in the sentence, 
that conform to normal usage while the discords describe constructions that deviate 
from the norm. 
In addition to effects created by a single concord or discord in a particular po- 
sition within the sentence, we can observe other kinds of effects pertaining to the 
relationships between concords and discords: 
Resolution: A shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a 
move from a relative discord to a stylistic concord. 
We can see an example of a resolution in 23 below. There is an initial discord, created 
by the unusual placement of the adverb entirely, which is not normally found in the 
initial position and is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence (cf. Section 3.4.3 
below). However, there is a final concord, as the subsequent main clause contains no 
such incongruities: 
23. Entirely in the spirit of protective support, could we suggest you pass on 
an appropriate comment o the personnel concernedJ 9 
And the complementary effect is dissolution: 
Dissolution: A shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is 
a move from a relative concord to a stylistic discord. 
We have already seen an example of a dissolution in one of the Biblical texts of 
Section 1.1, repeated below as 24. A strong initial concord, created by imitative clauses, 
is set against a final discord, produced by an uncommon syntactic inversion: 
24. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 2? 
3.4 Primitive Elements of Style 
3.4.1 Two Kinds of Stylistic Analysis. Now that a set of abstract stylistic elements has 
been defined, we must next consider how to use them in practical stylistic analysis. 
So far, these elements are too general to apply to the interpretation of an arbitrary 
sentence. We must relate these stylistic elements to more-basic syntactic elements, whose 
stylistic characteristics are more specific and concrete. In our reading of the literature 
19 Quirk et al (1985, p. 652). 
20 Matthew 7:27, Revised Standard Version (1952). 
467 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
of stylistics, we observed that two analyses of stylistic structure are possible: connective 
and hierarchic orderings: 
Connective ordering: The result of cohesive bonds drawing together components 
in a linear ordering. 
Hierarchic ordering: The result of bonds of subordination and superordination 
drawing together components in a nested ordering. 
These two complementary kinds of analysis are implicit in the work of most stylists 
and rhetoricians, uch as Cluett (1976) and Bureau (1976) (Neil Randall, personal com- 
munication). 
We will now use these notions of connective and hierarchic orderings to guide the 
definition of more-primitive stylistic elements that provide a precise syntactic basis to 
the vocabulary, yet alo allow a mapping to the abstract elements. 
3.4.2 The Role of Corpus Studies in the Classification of the Primitive Elements 
of Style. We believe that to establish stylistic classifications and construct a practical 
stylistic grammar, one must undertake corpus studies in the style of Cluett (1976) and 
Biber (1988, 1989) to support the exact classifications of stylistic effects. But we also 
agree with Crystal and Davy that: 
It is perhaps worth emphasising right away that the first step in any 
stylistic analysis must be an intuitive one. The stylistician is on pre- 
cisely the same footing as anyone else here: he notices a linguistic 
feature which he feels to be stylistically significant. The difference be- 
tween his approach and that of the untrained observer is that he will 
have a clearer idea of what is likely to be significant, and will know 
what to do with his observations once they are made. This last point 
is the stylistician's main competence: he is able to interrelate his obser- 
vations within the framework of some theory, and thus piece together 
any general pattern of linguistic variation which may exist. (Crystal 
and Davy 1969, p. 12) 
Thus, although we have built our grammar of style upon accepted theory, it is currently 
a prototype for the formal representation f stylistic knowledge, not yet developed as 
a tool for practical stylistic analysis. 21 For, like Crystal and Davy, our initial objective 
is to provide a methodology, a vocabulary and apparatus, that will allow others to 
integrate our approach with analytic procedures to construct useful formalizations of 
style: 
All we can do is systematically point to certain significant facts in the 
language being analysed, suggest some theoretical principles which 
will account for the occurrence of these facts, emphasise the need for 
further analysis to validate or refute these preliminary soundings, and 
illustrate a procedure which will allow people to do this. (Crystal and 
Davy 1969, p. 13) 
21 See Section 6 for a discussion of work in progress. 
468 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
In the manner of Crystal and Davy, we agree that statistical verification must 
follow such research, but we believe that, initially, we can use well-motivated intuitions 
about stylistic frequencies to classify our stylistic elements: 
Such a \[statistical\] method would be prerequisite for any serious re- 
search work, but it is too detailed for our present purposes. Conse- 
quently we make use of the alternative method of expression, making 
our statements of frequency in more informal terms, using such quan- 
tifiers as 'rarely', 'commonly', 'often', 'very often', and so on. This 
range of adverbials in English cuts up a continuum of frequency very 
clearly, with very little overlap, and is readily intelligible. It should 
not be forgotten, however, that any statements of relative frequency 
in these terms can be referred if necessary to the precise statistical 
situation which underlies them. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 22) 
3.4.3 Primitive Stylistic Elements. Primitive stylistic elements are individual con- 
stituents that have a particular stylistic effect. But what should we use as the basis 
for the definition of 'stylistic effect'? We have said that the two analyses of sentence 
structure, connective and hierarchic, can provide the appropriate guidance. We will 
define the stylistic effect of an individual component in terms of its contribution to 
each ordering: 
? For the connective view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its 
degree of cohesiveness, its bonding with other components in the sentence. 
? For the hierarchic view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its 
degree of subordination, its dependence on other components in the 
sentence. 
We introduce the terms conjunct, antijunct, subjunct, and superjunct (to be defined in 
the following sections) and we use superscripts on all the terms to indicate the degree 
of connectivity or subordination. In the connective view, we classify syntactic om- 
ponents as either conjunct 4 (excessively connective), conjunct 3 (strongly connective), 
conjunct 2 (moderately connective), conjunct 1 (mildly connective), and conjunct ? (neu- 
tral). Similarly, we use the terms antijunct ? through antijunct 4 to indicate increasingly 
disconnective effects; conjunct ? and antijunct ? are the same. 
There is a complementary vocabulary of primitive elements for the hierarchic view. 
The stylistic effects of syntactic omponents are correlated with the degree of subordi- 
nation or superordination; the classifications are analogous to the connective: subjunct 4 
through subjunct ? (decreasingly subordinate) and superjunct ? through superjunct 4 (in- 
creasingly superordinate); subjunct ? and superjunct ? are the same. 
Connective primitive elements. In assigning connective ffects to syntactic ompo- 
nents, we adapt Halliday and Hasan's (1976) work on cohesion. Although Halliday 
and Hasan focused on definitions of cohesion in whole texts, we can apply these 
definitions to cohesion within the sentence, for, as they point out: 
Since cohesive relations are not concerned with structure, they may 
be found just as well within a sentence as between sentences. They 
attract less notice within a sentence, because of the cohesive strength 
of grammatical structure; since the sentence hangs together already, 
469 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
the cohesion is not needed in order to make it hang together. But the 
cohesive relations are there all the same. (Halliday and Hasan 1976, 
p. 8) 
Halliday and Hasan enumerate five types of cohesion: substitution, ellipsis, reference, 
conjunction, and lexical cohesion. We will use all of these except lexical cohesion and 
will add a new factor, interpolation, that works against cohesion. 
Halliday and Hasan define substitution as the "replacement" (p. 88) of one item 
by another. We suggest hat such intrasentence phenomena as apposition and extra- 
position can be considered as types of substitution. For example, in 25, either of the 
two postmodifying noun phrases could substitute for the head noun Silvia: 
25. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50s, a shrew falsely mellowed by 
religion, promptly organized prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware 
meetings. 22 
And, in 26, the clausal subject for anyone to escape could substitute for the anticipatory 
pronoun it: 
26. It was considered impossible for anyone to escape. 23
Ellipsis is defined as the omission of an item. Many forms of ellipsis are possible 
within the sentence, including the omission of elements of clause structure. In the 
following sentence, the ellipsis is marked by . . . . .  
27. I'll gladly pay for the hotel, if you will __  for the food. 24 
Items that have the cohesive property of reference are not interpreted semantically 
in their own right, but make reference to something else for their interpretation (Halli- 
day and Hasan 1976, p. 31). In English, such items are personal pronouns, demonstra- 
tives, and comparatives. These 'directive' elements presuppose the existence of some 
other element from which information is to be retrieved; whether or not the other 
element is within the same sentence, the referential item will be cohesive. 
Conjunctive lements are defined as: 
elements \[that\] are not cohesive in themselves but indirectly, by virtue 
of their specific meanings; they are not primarily devices for reaching 
out into the preceding (or following) text, but they express certain 
meanings which presuppose the presence of other components in the 
discourse. (Halliday and Hasan 1976, p. 226) 
Halliday and Hasan cite the conjunction and, certain adverbs, and certain prepositional 
expressions as instances of conjunction. Many of these elements can promote cohesion 
within the sentence. 
To the principles of cohesion described above, we will add interpolation, a discon- 
nective relation that works against cohesion. Interpolated elements are certain instances

earlierY In the examples below (repeated from Section 3.3.1), we see several different

Stephen and Jennifer are not going to buy the house, according to 
a spokesman. 
The cohesive relations described above can be ranked from the most to the least 
cohesive. Halliday and Hasan (pp. 226-227) consider substitution, including ellipsis, 
to be the most strictly cohesive relation, followed by reference, and then conjunction. 
We adopt this ranking, and so we classify intrasentential substitution and ellipsis 
as strongly connective (conjunct3), reference as moderately connective (conjunct2), and 
conjunction as mildly connective (conjunct 1). We classify interpolation as disconnective 
(antijunct2). 28 
As an illustration of our method of classification of connective primitive lements, 
we will use the following sentences, in which the underlined components exhibit dis- 
tinct stylistic effects. In the first sentence, the postmodifying construction is a strongly 
connective, conjunct 3 reduced relative clause, as it is an instance of ellipsis for which 
the presupposed items are who is. The postmodifying relative clause in 32 is a moder- 
ately connective, conjunct 2 referential element, as the relative pronoun 'points' to the 
preceding noun phrase the man. Lastly, the postposed adjectival in 33 is a disconnec- 
tive, antijunct instance of interpolation, as it is detached from the rest of the sentence 
and has none of the cohesive properties. (The property of ellipsis is not present, as a 
postposed adjective, unlike a reduced relative clause, does not have the same element 
of presupposition f specific missing items.): 
31. The man __ walking into the room is unfit for this task. 
32. The man who is walking into the room is unfit for this task. 
33. A man always timid is unfit for this task. 29 
Hierarchic primitive elements. In assigning a hierarchic lassification to a syntactic 
component, we adapt Halliday's (1985) work on subordination in functional grammar 
and Quirk et al's (1985) use of the term superordination. 
25 Another type of structure that seems to work against cohesion is a disruption in normal inear 
ordering, as the syntactic inversion at the end of the now-familiar text, And the rains descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. However, we 
have not yet incorporated this feature into our formalization of style.

Halliday distinguishes two types of subordination: embedding (or rank-shifting) and 
hypotaxis. These phenomena will be used to classify the hierarchic primitive elements 
in our stylistic grammar. Embedding is described as: 
the 'rank shift' by which a clause or phrase comes to function within 
the structure of a group, like who came to dinner in the man who came to 
dinner. (Halliday 1985, p. 219) 
There are various types of embeddings, including prepositional phrases, as in John 
might arrive as early as tomorrow, but Halliday focuses on those within the nominal 
group: 
\[The embedded prepositional phrase\] is the only instance of embed- 
ding other than in a nominal group. All other embedding in English 
is a form of nominalization, where a group, phrase, or clause comes 
to function as part of, or in place of (i.e., as the whole of), a nominal 
group. (Halliday 1985, p. 187) 
Examples of embedded subordination are finite and nonfinite clauses 3? that function 
as postmodifiers, asin the house that lack built, or as the head of a nominal group, as in 
For Jack to build a house would be the best thing (Halliday 1985, p. 220). 
Halliday defines hypotaxis as: 
the binding of elements of unequal status. The dominant element is 
free, but the dependent element isnot. \[p. 198\] In a hypotactic structure 
the elements are ordered in dependence, and this ordering is largely 
independent of the sequence. \[p. 199\] 
There are many types of hypotaxis, at the clause, phrase, and word levels. Examples 
of hypotactic subordination i clude a dependent clause following a dominant clause, 
preceding the dominant, enclosed in the dominant, or enclosing the dominant: 
34. You never can tell till you try. 31 
35. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. 32 
36. Picture, if you can, a winkle. 33 
37. He might, he said, finish it himself. 34 
It should be emphasized that the two types of subordination are quite different: 
It is important to distinguish between embedding on the one hand and 
... hypotaxis on the other. Whereas hypotaxis \[is a relation\] BETWEEN 
clauses (or other ranking elements), embedding is not. Embedding is 
30 If the clause is relative, then it must be defining (restrictive) to be an embedded clause; a non-defining 
relative clause is an instance of hypotaxis (to be defined below).

Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
a mechanism whereby a clause or phrase comes to function as a con- 
stituent WITHIN the structure of a group, which itself is a constituent 
of a clause. (Halliday 1985, p. 219) 
Consequently, the stylistic effects of embedding and hypotaxis will be subtly different. 
Because an embedded structure is a constituent of the dominant structure, we will clas- 
sify embeddings as strongly subordinate, subjunct 3. On the other hand, in hypotaxis, 
one component is dependent on another, but "in no sense is it a constituent part of 
it" (Halliday 1985, p. 219), so we will classify hypotactic structures as only mildly 
subordinate, subjunct 1. 
To the factors of embedding and hypotaxis, we add another factor, superordination, 
that accounts for structures that are somehow 'superior '  to the main clause. 35 That such 
phenomena exist is supported by Quirk et al's (1985) definition of disjunct, which we 
repeat here from Section 3.3.1: 
Disjuncts . . .  have a superior role as compared with the sentence l- 
ements; they are syntactically more detached and in some respects 
'superordinate,'  in that they seem to have a scope that extends over 
the sentence as a whole. (Quirk et al 1985, p. 613) 
Disjuncts can be divided into two main classes, style disjuncts and content disjuncts: 
Style disjuncts convey the speaker 's  comment on the style and form 
of what he is saying, defining in some way under what conditions 
he is speaking as the 'authority' for the utterance. Content disjuncts 
(also known as attitudinal disjuncts) make observations on the actual 
content of the utterance and its truth conditions. (Quirk et al 1985, 
p. 615) 
Examples of these superordinate lements are underl ined in the following sen- 
tences (the first three contain style disjuncts, the fourth, a content disjunct): 
38. Frankly, I am tired. 36 
39. If I may say so without offence, your writing is immature. 37 
40. There were twelve people present, to be precise. 38 
41. Even more important, she has control over the finances of the party. 39 
In our grammar, we classify these types of superordinate elements as superjunct. 
As an illustration of our method of classification of hierarchic primitive elements, 
we will use the following sentences, which display distinct stylistic effects due to the 
different primitive classifications of the underl ined components. In the first sentence 
below, the postmodifying restrictive relative clause is a strongly subordinate, subjunct 3 
instance of embedding. The medial adverbial clause in 43 is a mildly subordinate, 
35 We do not consider the case of a main clause being superordinate o a dependent clause (Quirk et al 
1985, pp. 988-990). We are concerned only with structures that are superordinate o the matrix clause.

p. 214). Lastly, the initial adjective in 44 is a superordinate, superjunct instance of a 
style disjunct. 
42. The money which was our reward has been useful. 
43. The money, as it was our reward_, should not be used for frivolous 
purposes. 
44. True, the money has been useful. 
3.5 Concords and Discords 
In Section 3.3.3, we gave an informal description of the abstract elements of concord 
and discord. As these elements are closely tied to the primitive-level descriptions of 
our vocabulary, we delayed their precise characterizations until after the primitive 
elements of style were introduced. Now, we can define the nature of concords and 
discords for both the connective and hierarchic views. In both views, the concords 
represent constructions, ata particular position in the sentence, that conform to normal 
usage, while the discords describe constructions that deviate from the norm. 
In the connective view, the concords are associated with constructions that are 
connective, for we assume that cohesion is the default usage, while the discords are 
disconnective structures, as a lack of cohesion is less usual. Thus, a concord, which 
may be initial, medial, or final, is produced by a conjunct construction; a discord, which 
may also appear in any of the three positions, is caused by an antijunct construction. 
For the hierarchic view, concords are associated with structures that display a 
'normal' degree of subordination or superordination, while discords are produced 
by excessive subordination or excessive superordination. Excessive subordination and 
superordination are difficult to characterize, but, as a first attempt, we propose that 
nesting of dependent structures to a depth greater than three will be considered is- 
cordant subordination and that 'detachment' of superordinate structures by 'intrusive' 
punctuation (e.g., long dashes) will be considered iscordant superordination. 
4. A Stylistic Grammar 
4.1 A Methodology for Developing a Stylistic Grammar 
So far, we have constructed a vocabulary of style. We can now define a method for 
using the vocabulary to systematically build up a syntactic stylistic grammar for both 
the connective and hierarchic views of style. 
To construct the stylistic grammar, we will use a methodology whose steps are as 
follows: 
? the classification of primitive stylistic elements; 
? the correlation of the stylistic effects of these elements with the abstract 
stylistic elements; and 
? the correlation of patterns of these abstract elements with specific 
stylistic goals. 
The grammar to be constructed in this manner will be stratified with internal 
branching, as illustrated in Figure 1. As the figure shows, at the bottom level there 
are three branches--lexical, syntactic, and semantic--each with its own vocabulary

of primitive stylistic elements and rules for combining them. At the central level, 
we use a single vocabulary of abstract elements, stylistic terms that are maximally 
expressive. Rules relate these abstract elements to patterns of lexical, syntactic, and 
semantic primitive elements. This level is the unifying core of the grammar; as we 
will note later, the same abstract elements can describe both English and French style, 
and both syntactic and semantic aspects of style. Finally, at the top level, rules correlate 
individual stylistic goals with patterns of abstract elements. Together, these levels form 
a language-independent 4? schema for a goal-directed grammar. 
4.2 Grammar of Primitive Elements 
The stylistic grammar that we have outlined in the previous ection shows how lexical, 
syntactic, and semantic aspects of style would be integrated within one grammar. Some 
work has already been done on the development of the lexical and semantic branches 
(see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), but here we will focus on syntactic style. We will now trace 
the development of the syntactic omponent of the stylistic grammar, beginning with 
the most detailed and most closely syntactic level, the grammar of primitive elements. 
As we proposed earlier, we will consider two analyses of sentence structure, connective 
and hierarchic, each with its own stylistic classifications. In this base-level grammar of 
40 We expect that a particular stylistic grammar will be applicable toa family of stylistically similar 
languages. 
475 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
primitive elements, the rules are based on syntactic and stylistic rules of Crystal and 
Davy (1969), Kane (1983), and Quirk et al (1985). 
In the full grammars given by DiMarco (1990) and subsequently b  Hoyt (1993), 
each syntactic ategory is given both a connective and a hierarchic primitive classifi- 
cation by corresponding rules. Here, we will present only selected rules, mainly those 
associated with the stylistic effects of various types of premodification a d postmodifi- 
cation in the nominal group. We will begin with the elementary components and work 
up to full sentences. In the presentation of the grammar rules, we will first give the 
connective rules, then their hierarchic ounterparts. Often, we will annotate rules with 
relevant examples. (Explanatory notes on the terminology are given in Appendix A.) 
Adjectivals. Adjectivals and adverbials are the simplest classes of primitive lements. 
To demonstrate hat even the smallest syntactic omponents have individual stylistic 
effects, we give selections from the rules for the adjectivals. 
Connective view. Adjectivals can be classified within a range of connectivity. In
the moderately connective case, there are a number of alternatives, two of which are 
shown below. The first alternative, the genitive form, is a referential element, as it 
presupposes the existence of the noun to which it refers. Whether or not this noun is 
in the same sentence, a referential personal pronoun is cohesive and so it is classified 
as a conjunct 2 element. The second alternative, a demonstrative d terminer, is also 
classified as moderately connective because it too is a referential element. 
Rule 
conjunct 2 adjectival 
premodifying genitive 
hi__ss religious works 
demonstrative d terminer 
this substantial selection 
The less-conjunct ase has only one alternative, an adjective. An adjective isusually 
used as a premodifier of a noun, so that it presupposes the presence of the noun. 
However, it is not a directive, referential element, but rather a conjunctive one. Thus, 
it is classified as conjunct 1. 
Rule 
conjunct 1 adjectival 
adjective 
medieval iconographic subject 
Hierarchic view. Adjectivals are generally hypotactic rather than embedded ele- 
ments. That is, they are linked to an element (the noun) of different status that could 
stand as an independent whole, whereas the adjectival could not. Therefore, we will 
classify most adjectivals as subjunct 1, mildly subordinating. However, nominal adjec- 
tives, which have been rank-shifted, are instances of embedding and so are subjunct 3, 
more strongly subordinating.

Premodification. Crystal and Davy's (1969) 'stylistic' grammar, although elementary, 
rightly recognized the stylistic importance of premodification a d postmodification f 
the nominal group. Our syntactic stylistic grammar is built upon the stylistic effects 
created by these types of modification. We first describe selected rules of premodification. 
Connective view. The rules for moderately connective, conjunct 2, and less connective, 
conjunct 1, premodification are self-explanatory. 
Rule

The following rule for non-connective, conjunct ? premodification has three alterna- 
tives, an adverbial, a participle, and no premodification. Premodifying adverbials and 
participles do not display any of the explicit forms of cohesion but neither do they 
work against cohesion. They are not connective but neither are they disconnective. 
Rule 
conjunct ? premodification

477 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
The following rule for disconnective, antijunct 2 premodification has only one alter- 
native, a reduced sentence. A reduced sentence can be considered to be an instance of 
interpolation, so that it works against cohesion. 
Rule 
antijunct 2 premodification

I visited his pop-down-for-the-weekend cottage. 
We can now begin to introduce primitive stylistic categories that will be used 
to build up the definitions of the corresponding abstract elements that we saw in 
earlier sections. When premodification is conjunct, it is classified as centroschematic 
premodification. In turn, this type of premodification is concordant, for it is associated 
with cohesive effects, which we take to be normal usage.

When premodification is antijunct, then it is discordant, for there is a degree of 
disconnectivity that works against cohesion; it is therefore not normal usage. 41 
Rule

Hierarchic view. In the full grammar, we define detailed rules for the various subjunct 
and superjunct types of premodification. Here, we will show only selected rules. 
The following rule for strongly subordinating, subjunct 3 premodification has four 
alternatives. The first is self-explanatory. The other three, reduced sentences, adver- 
bials, and participles, are embedded, rank-shifted constructions, which are therefore 
classified as subjunct 3.

classify this type of discordant premodification as subjunct 4 premodification. Now we 
can define the following rules for concordant and discordant premodification:

Postmodification. Continuing to build upon the stylistic features that Crystal and 
Davy (1969) judged important, we define complementary connective and hierarchic 
rules for postmodification i the full grammar and give selected rules here. 
Connective view. The rule for conjunct 3 postmodification has three alternatives, a nom- 
inal group, a nonfinite clause, and a verbless clause. 42 As these constructions are in- 
stances of either substitution or ellipsis, they are strongly connective.

Now we can define the various types of concordant and discordant postmodification, 
according to whether the postmodification is cohesive (and therefore concordant) or 
lacking cohesion (discordant). 
43 We do not define all forms of parenthesis, but these can be easily enumerated by using, for example, 
the classifications given by Quirk et al (1985).

Hierarchic view. In the rule for subjunct 3 postmodification, the alternatives are a 
restrictive relative clause, a restrictive nonfinite clause, a nominal group, and a prepo- 
sitional phrase. All of these are instances of embedding, as they function as a part of 
the nominal group, so they are strongly subordinating elements.

In the rule for subjunct I postmodification, the alternatives are an adjectival, a nonre- 
strictive relative clause, and a nonrestrictive nonfinite clause. All of these are instances 
of hypotaxis, as none of them is a constituent of the nominal group, so they are clas- 
sified as mildly subordinating elements.

In the hierarchic view, discord is produced by excessive subordination. We will 
classify this type of discordant postmodification assubjunct 4 postmodification. Now we 
can define the concordant and discordant varieties of hierarchic postmodification as 
follows:

a larger constituent, he noun phrase. 46 
Rule

45 The meanings of and and or in our grammar are explained in Appendix A. 
46 In the full grammar, a noun phrase can also be a pronoun or a nominal clause. 
483 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
The following stylistic variations of noun phrases are defined in the obvious way, 
according to the corresponding types of their premodification a d postmodification: 
monoschematic noun phrase 
centroschematic noun phrase 
heteropoisal noun phrase 
concordant noun phrase 
discordant noun phrase 
A question that arises at this point is the projection problem; that is, the problem of 
how the stylistic effect of a sentence, or even a sentence component, is modified by the 
stylistic characteristics of the components nested within it. Our solution is to assume 
that if a component is concordant then all its components, toall levels of nesting, must 
be concordant, but if a component is discordant then at least one of its components, 
at some level of nesting, must have been discordant. Thus, if we have a noun phrase 
consisting of concordant premodification, a noun, and discordant postmodification, 
the whole noun phrase will be classified as discordant. 
We realize this is a very simplified solution, but we believe it will be acceptable in
our work, for our sample corpus, although drawn from high-quality magazine writing, 
has few examples of nesting to more than one or two levels. 
Verb phrases. The basic verb phrase is defined as follows: 
Rule 
verb phrase

The following stylistic variations of verb phrases are defined in the obvious way, 
according to the types of their components: 
monoschematic verb phrase 
centroschematic verb phrase 
heteropoisal verb phrase 
concordant verb phrase 
discordant verb phrase 
Sentences. We also define rules in the full grammar for complements, prepositional 
phrases, and dependent clauses. With these rules, we have all the components of 
a sentence and can define sentence structures of increasing complexity. The first of 
these structures i the major, a single main clause; the next is the complete, which adds 
dependent clauses to the main clause. In some rules, we introduce specializations 
according to the position of a certain type of stylistic element. An initial discordant 
complete, for example, is a sentence that has a discordant component in the initial 
position.

give a complete s ntence:

those for major sentences, o that our grammar includes the following varieties:

4.3 Grammar of Abstract Elements 
Having completed the construction of the bottom level of the stylistic grammar, the 
classification of primitive stylistic elements, we can now define the central evel, the 
grammar of abstract elements. This will correlate the stylistic effects of the primitive 
elements with the abstract elements that were defined in Section 3.3. At this level, the 
connective and hierarchic views become integrated. 
A monoschematic sentence is a single main clause with optional, simple forms of 
subordination. 
Rule

A centroschematic sentence is built up around a central main clause and can have 
complex subordination and dependent clauses.

has at least one dependent clause.

As well as observing localized effects of concord and discord, we can recognize 
more-global shifts from concord to discord, or discord to concord. That is, a specific 
part of the sentence seems incongruous, discordant, but this discord is interpreted 
within the context of the rest of the sentence, so that it may either be 'resolved' by a 
return to a usual form, or left unresolved. We have formalized these two situations 
in the abstract elements of resolution and dissolution. A resolution is a shift in stylistic 
effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a move from a relative discord to a 
concord. A dissolution is a shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence 
and is a move from a relative concord to a discord.

4.4 Grammar of Stylistic Goals 
Having completed the central level in the stylistic grammar, the grammar of abstract 
elements, we can now define the rules at the top level that correlate patterns of the 
abstract elements with the writer's specific goals. 
Stylistic goals, such as clarity, are elusive qualities that up to now have been 
defined by stylists by means of examples and informal rules. However, with the vo- 
cabulary and formal grammar that we have defined, we now have a way of seeing and 
abstracting what these examples have in common. We can abstract from a plethora 
of low-level syntactic rules that stylists traditionally have used, and can now define 
formal rules for specific stylistic goals. 
Note that stylistic goals can be organized along orthogonal dimensions. For ex- 
ample, a writer might try to be clear, or obscure, or make no effort either way. Clarity 
and obscurity are thus opposite nds of a stylistic dimension. Likewise, the goals of 
concreteness and abstraction form a dimension, and so do staticness and dynamism. Be- 
low, we look at one end of each of these dimensions; for details of their duals, see 
DiMarco (1990) and Hoyt (1993). 
Clarity. Clarity is a very pervasive stylistic goal. Almost all the advice in textbooks 
of style and rhetoric is aimed at teaching the writer how to achieve clarity. Clarity, 
in other words, is thought o be the norm that a writer should strive for. To be clear 
is to be plain, precise, and predictable. In keeping with stylistic theory, therefore, we 
interpret the goal of clarity as adherence tothe stylistic norm and incorporate accepted 
definitions of norm, that is, cohesive and concordant s ructures, in our grammar rule 
for clarity. 
Thus, we can use our stylistic grammar to give precise definitions to the kinds of 
sentences that Kane (1983), for example, associates with clarity: 
? Simple sentences, which consist of one independent clause: these are our 
monoschematic sentences. 
? Centered sentences, which consist of dependent constructions, followed 
by a main clause, followed by additional dependent clauses. We expand 
the notion of 'centered sentence' to include any sentence in which there 
is a dominant, concordant core: these are our centroschematic sentences. 
? Parallel sentences, which reduce ambiguity by stressing the same 
grammatical form: these are our homopoisal sentences. 
Hence, we define clarity as follows: 
Rule 
clarity 
monoschematic 
centroschematic 
homopoise 
488 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
Concreteness. Kane (1983) associates concreteness with sentences that suggest an effect 
of immediacy, in which the writer has arranged elements to reflect the natural order 
of events or ideas, so that syntax mirrors events. In the terms of our grammar, con- 
creteness i  associated with sentences that emphasize a particular component, which 
may be highlighted either because it is discordant or because it is parenthetical, as in a 
heteropoise. 
Rule 
concreteness .  > 
initial discord 
medial discord 
final discord 
dissolution 
heteropoise 
Staticness. We associate staticness with sentences in which there is little opportunity 
for stylistic variation, that is, sentences that verge on being 'fixed forms.' These are 
the monoschematic sentences, which are standard and simple structures, or the more 
elaborate but strictly balanced structures, the homopoisal sentences.

5. STYLISTIQUE: A Syntactic Stylistic Parser 
So far, we have developed a vocabulary and methodology for constructing a stylistic 
grammar and we have shown how these tools have been applied to the construction 
of an English syntactic stylistic grammar. In DiMarco (1990), we applied the same vo- 
cabulary and methodology to develop a French syntactic stylistic grammar. However, 
these grammars provide only a theoretical foundation for a computational theory of 
stylistics. Now we describe the implementation of the stylistic grammars in a com- 
putational system. In this section, we will describe the organization of STYLISTIQUE, a 
syntactic stylistic parser that interprets the stylistic grammar. We will present a short 
example to illustrate STYLISTIQUE's method of analysis. 
5.1 How STYLISTIQUE works 
The English and French syntactic stylistic grammars are implemented in separate 
parsers that form the STYLISTIQUE system, a definite clause grammar that consists of 
489 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
det(conjunct2_determiner,subjunctl_determiner,this,singular). 
det(conjunct2_determiner,subjunctl_determiner,my,singular). 
adj(conjunct1_adjective,subjunctl_adjective,large).

over 9,000 lines of QUINTUS PROLOG code. Each stylistic parser consists of the following 
three major modules: 
? Lexicon: In addition to conventional information, the lexical entries are 
augmented by annotations indicating the connective and hierarchic 
primitive stylistic classifications associated with each word. Figure 2 
shows several sample lexical entries. 
? Syntactic analysis: The parser performs a conventional syntactic analysis, 
building a parse tree that identifies the grammatical structure of a 
sentence. 47
? Stylistic analysis: The stylistic analysis proceeds in tandem with the 
syntactic parse. The primitive-element a alysis assigns connective and 
hierarchic lassifications to each sentence component as it is added to the 
parse tree. The abstract-element a alysis builds higher-level patterns from 
these connective and hierarchic primitive elements. The stylistic-goal 
analysis correlates these patterns of abstract elements with the author's 
possible stylistic goals. It chooses one goal from each of the following 
three dimensions: 
Clarity/neutral ity/obscurity; 
Concreteness/neutral ity/abstraction; 
Staticness / neutral i ty/dynamism. 
The translation from the grammar ules that were shown in Section 4 to the im- 
plementation was straightforward. In most cases, there was an easy way of mapping 
between the theoretical rules and the PROLOG rules. For example, heteropoisal postmodifi- 
cation is described in the grammar as postmodification that is parenthetical nd either 
conjunct or antijunct, such as a nominal group or a nonfinite clause. The grammar 
rules and corresponding PROLOG rule for one alternative in the definition of postmod- 
ification that is both heteropoisal nd concordant is shown in Figure 3. 48 
Although STYLISTIQUE can usually run unaided, it does require punctuation in the 
input sentences to assist in disambiguation during parsing. The underlying stylistic 
grammar is highly complex, and so, lacking the aid of semantics, the stylistic parser 
can produce a number of syntactically grammatical, but not necessarily stylistically 
correct, parses for a given sentence. The standard PROLOG cut might have constrained 
backtracking and reduced the number of correct parses, but it seemed too crude and 
unpredictable to be easily applied to so complex and interdependent a system of rules 
47 The English parser is based on a conventional parser written by Kern Luther and Rick MacLean at the 
University of Toronto, with supplementary rules suggested by Crystal and Davy (1969) and Quirk 
et al (1985). The French parser is also based on Luther and MacLean's code, with supplementary rules 
adapted from Dubois and Dubois-Charlier (1970) and Galichet (1970). 
48 The prefix "c" in the PROLOG rule indicates that the structure isconcordant.

as STYLISTIQUE. As a simpler solution, we introduced explicit markers of punctuation 
that provide a form of partial disambiguation, as they do what the system should have 
done unaided but couldn't, because of the limitations mentioned above. STYLISTIQUE 
requires this prior disambiguation mostly for reasons of efficiency. For example, most 
parsers are unable to handle the conjunction and by any means other than trying 
all possible parses (Snarr 1984). The problem is analogous for or and for the comma 
(which can be considered a word). In our parser, the situation is complicated by the 
same conjunctions and the same punctuation markers playing different roles according 
to their level in the sentence structure. As a consequence, different conjunctions and 
punctuation markers are used at the sentence, clause, complement, and noun phrase 
level. 
5.2 A Sample Stylistic Parse 
A corpus of 75 sentences (52 English, 23 French) was used to test the parser. These 
sentences were chosen to demonstrate a substantial degree of stylistic variation. The 
following short example illustrates the kind of analysis that STYLISTIQUE produces for 
the sentence: 
45. True, posterity has been kind. 
In subsequent sections, we will give an interpretation f the following parse tree for 
this sentence. 49 
Stylistic goals of this sentence: 
\[clarity,concreteness,neutral\] 
Abstract stylistic elements (Connective view): 
\[\[initial_and_medial_concord,initial_concord\], 
\[centroschematic,monoschematic\], 
\[initial_hetsropoise,c_initial_heteropoise\]\] 
49 For brevity, we have omitted the hierarchical primitive-element parse.

5.2.1 Primitive-Element Analysis. The sentence is concordant, for it consists of a con- 
cordant main clause, the major, with no subordinate clauses. It begins with a style 
disjunct, true, which is an elliptic adjectival and therefore considered to have a con- 
nective, concordant effect, even if used in the initial parenthetical position. After the 
initial disjunct, the sentence continues with the bare noun posterity, which, lacking both 
premodification and postmodification 5?is a minimal, and therefore concordant, noun 
phrase. The sentence nds with the basic verb phrase has been kind, consisting of only 
the copula 51 been, and the concordant, conjunct 1 adjective kind; this is an inherently 
concordant verb phrase. 
The sentence is concordant from the hierarchic view as well, for it has the form 
of a concordant initial heteropoisal complete sentence. This indicates that the sentence 
begins with a parenthetical construction, which in this case is the disjunct, true, a 
superordinate adjectival. The bare noun posterity, lacking both premodification and 
postmodification, is a monoschematic noun phrase. The verb phrase has been kind is 
basic and therefore monoschematic. 
50 STYLISTIQUE must  assign a primitive classification to the postmodification so that this information 
can be passed up to the higher levels of the noun phrase. As a consequence, the absence of 
postmodification must  be marked as (trivially) centroschematic postmodification, in the connective 
view, and (trivially) monoschematic postmodification, in the hierarchic view. 
51 The stylistic effects of auxiliary verbs are not taken into account, and so these verb forms are not 
recorded in the stylistic parse. 
Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
5.2.2 Abstract-Element Analysis. In the connective view, the significant position el- 
ements are initial and medial concords. The significant dominance lements are cen- 
troschematic and monoschematic. That is, this sentence has one dominant shape, which 
is, in fact, the whole sentence: it is monoschematic but also trivially centroschematic. 
STYLISTIQUE produces the most detailed analysis it can and does not prune extraneous 
information. The single important balance element is an initial heteropoise. 
In the hierarchic view, STYLISTIQUE finds no significant position elements, but rec- 
ognizes one dominance and one balance element: the sentence is centroschematic and 
an initial heteropoise. It is the initial disjunct, true, that introduces a superordinate 
effect; this feature makes the sentence slightly too complex to be monoschematic. 
5.2.3 Stylistic-Goal Analysis. First, we consider the analysis of the sentence on the 
clarity/obscurity dimension. The presence of the concords in the connective view, 
together with the connective and hierarchic entroschematic structures, gives the sen- 
tence an effect of clarity. In a less obvious manner, the presence of an initial disjunct 
affects stylistic goals on the other dimensions. Because a superordinate parenthetical 
component is present, the sentence is a heteropoise and therefore considered to be con- 
crete. On the staticness/dynamism di ension, the sentence has no definite leaning in 
either direction. 
To summarize, this is a simple clear sentence with the slight incongruity of an 
initial parenthesis to relieve its blandness. 
5.3 Limitations of the Implementation 
STYLISTIQUE'S limitations arise from the following characteristics of the system: 
? The implementation f the grammar is incomplete. 
? The grammar is too coarse-grained. 
In the first case, the incomplete implementation f the grammar, STYLISTIQUE can 
sometimes produce analyses that are inaccurate, though not incorrect, because, due 
to time constraints, only about 90% of the full English and French syntactic stylistic 
grammars was implemented. 
In the second case, the coarse grain of the stylistic grammar eflects theoretical 
limitations. The effect of coarse-grainedness was observed in the parses of some of the 
sentences in the sample corpus: 
Some sentences were parsed as simultaneously having both an initial 
concord and an initial discord. For example, both the following sentences 
were analyzed in this inconsistent manner: 
46. To tell everybody is the best thing. 
47. Telling lies is wrong. 
Some position elements were incorrectly identified: for example, a final 
discord was recorded as an initial discord. 
Some sentences with obviously different degrees of cohesiveness 
received the same analysis at the abstract-element level. 
These anomalous results are not due to programming errors, but to the excessive ab- 
493 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 
stractness of the abstract elements and the resulting coarse grain of the grammar. It 
was a deliberate choice to define elements that were quite abstract. A major limitation 
of previous work in stylistics was the use of terms that were so specific and so numer- 
ous that it was not possible to identify general stylistic features that were common to 
sentences that were stylistically similar, but not obviously syntactically similar. How- 
ever, our stylistic terms have occasionally erred on the side of being too abstract. For 
example, an initial discord in a STYLISTIQUE analysis may correctly identify the presence 
of a discord in the sentence but, because the scope of the element can be so broad, 
STYLISTIQUE sometimes cannot distinguish between a true initial discord, which occurs 
at the start of a sentence, and a noninitial discord that seems to be 'initial' because it 
affects the whole sentence. 
The excessive abstractness of the stylistic elements was further demonstrated by 
the rules in Section 4.4, where we used the same patterns of elements to define both 
clarity and staticness. That there may be different ypes of monoschematic sentences, 
some merely clear, others static as well, has been overlooked in a stylistic analysis that 
relies on maximally expressive descriptions. Our grammar currently does not allow 
for such subtleties; although it fulfills our objective of a formalization of style that 
captures many generalities, it is not yet sufficiently expressive to distinguish all the 
subtleties we would wish. 
6. Summary and Conclusion 
In this final section, we will review the contributions of the research described in this 
paper and conclude with a discussion of some of the new directions that the work is 
taking. 
6.1 Contributions of the Research 
The problem of style presented advantages as a focus for new research. The codifica- 
tion of stylistic knowledge had been a virtually unexplored problem even within the 
general research area of computational linguistics. With very few exceptions, previous 
work had been unambitious (for example, counting word frequencies, or advocating 
basic rules of composition). 
Our aim was to create a formal representation f goal-directed, nonliterary stylis- 
tics and, moreover, to do so in a manner applicable to different languages. The solution 
we proposed was the codification of stylistic knowledge in the form of a stylistic gram- 
mar. The construction of a stylistic grammar constitutes a theoretical advance over 
previous work in stylistics, for researchers had not attempted to produce a formal 
treatment of style, but had relied simply on unstructured normative or descriptive 
'rules.' The work we have done toward a grammar of style has brought ogether ideas 
from stylistic theory and knowledge representation and applied them to a hitherto 
unformalized body of knowledge. 
As a result of building English and French stylistic grammars, we were able to 
give more-formal definitions of stylistic goals. Previously, our understanding had been 
either purely subjective or based on established but unformalized usage. Now we have 
a grammar that correlates tylistic goals with specific patterns of abstract properties of 
text. Our contribution to more-formal definitions of stylistic goals was demonstrated 
for both syntactic and semantic style, as Ryan (1989, 1992) adapted our vocabulary 
and methodology to construct a semantic stylistic grammar that correlated the focus 
structure of paragraphs with the abstract elements, and the abstract elements with 
specific stylistic goals. In so doing, he augmented the definitions of stylistic goals. 
The English and French syntactic stylistic grammars were implemented in STYLIS- 
494

TIQUE, a stylistic parser that produced etailed goal-directed stylistic analyses of sen- 
tences typical of sophisticated magazine writing. 
6.2 Applications of the Research 
6.2.1 Style in Machine Translation. We have developed separate English and French 
stylistic grammars and parsers. DiMarco and Hirst (1990) describes the application 
of our ideas to machine translation. Given the current French and English stylistic 
grammars, the next step in building a system that could preserve style in translation 
was to define a mapping between these grammars. Mah (1991, 1992) adapted and 
extended our work to add a practical, computational treatment of French-English 
comparative stylistics to the theory. This work will eventually make possible machine 
translation systems that would be able to preserve or modify style in translation. 
Makuta-Giluk (1991; Makuta-Giluk and DiMarco 1993) developed a computational 
theory of rhetoric that builds upon our theory to deal with the codification of higher- 
level pragmatic effects of language, such as formality, persuasion, and sincerity. Her 
work is also applicable to the preservation of stylistic effects in translation. 
6.2.2 Natural Language Generation with Stylistic Constraints. The ability to deal 
with stylistic and pragmatic aspects of language is important not only in natural 
language understanding, but in generation as well. Our stylistic grammar provides a 
formal representation f stylistic knowledge that was previously lacking in generation 
systems that attempted to deal with pragmatic issues. BenHassine (1992) adapted 
our knowledge representation for stylistics in order to incorporate stylistic constraints 
into the Penman language generation system (Penman 1988). Green (1992a, 1992b) 
extended and refined our theory of style by adapting work from functional grammar. 
Hoyt (1993) and Green have implemented the new theory in an integrated stylistic 
analyzer and generator, espectively. DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) are looking at 
lexical choice in natural language generation, including considerations of lexical style. 
6.2.3 Second-Language Teaching. What has been learned from developing STYLIS- 
TIQUE has also been applied to machine-aided language instruction. Existing language- 
teaching systems focus almost exclusively on the basics of composition. An instruc- 
tional version of STYLISTIQUE could systematically develop a student's understanding 
of the more advanced aspects of language composition. Payette (1990; Payette and 
Hirst 1992) developed an instructional system that, applying some of our ideas, ana- 
lyzes input sentences for basic normative style and clarity, and offers feedback to the 
student. 
6.3 Conclusion 
Stylistic and pragmatic aspects, though necessary in complete understanding of lan- 
guage, have been neglected in computational linguistics research. These problems had 
been too vague and ill-defined to be dealt with by computational systems. However, 
in this work, we have developed a novel, formal representation f stylistic knowledge 
that makes the problem of stylistic analysis more amenable to computational solution. 
It is hoped that this research will lead to a system sophisticated enough to deal 
with a range of stylistic problems. Long-term applications include the development of a 
stylistic post-editor for use in a machine translation system. In addition, the continuing 
enhancements of the stylistic analyzer should contribute to a better understanding of 
the role style plays in language generation and teaching. The ongoing development 
of a formal framework for the representation f knowledge about stylistics should 
provide a partial computer model of how people produce style in language.

Appendix A: Notes on Terminology 
At all levels of the grammar, the left-hand side of each rule identifies what is being 
defined, and the right-hand side lists one or more alternative realizations, one per line. 
Sometimes, a particular alternative will be illustrated by an accompanying example. 
For instance, the following rule describes the conjunct 2 type of adjectival: 
Rule 
conjunct 2 adjectival 
premodifying genitive 
hi___ss religious works 
demonstrative d terminer 
this substantial selection 
In this rule, the first alternative realization of a conjunct 2 adjectival is a premodifying 
genitive, such as the possessive his in his religious works. The second alternative is a 
demonstrative determiner, such as this in this substantial selection. 
In the grammar, we will use various shorthand notations to simplify the presen- 
tation of the rules. However, these abbreviated forms can be expanded into standard 
context-free grammar ules. The shorthand notations are as follows; they are illustrated 
by particular examples, but are intended for general use: 
1. adjectival ~ intensifier adjective 
The juxtaposition of terms on the right-hand side of a rule indicates a concatenation 
of instances of these terms. For example, the rule above allows the intensifier very to 
be followed by the adjective happy to form an adjectival, very happy. 
2. adjectival ~ (intensifier) adjective 
Parentheses indicate that the form is optional. In this example, an adjectival could be 
either an intensifier followed by an adjective or an adjective alone. 
3. adjectival > (intensifier) + adjective 
The Kleene cross indicates one or more occurrences of the form within parentheses. 
4. adject ival  ~ (intensifier)* adjective 
The Kleene star indicates zero or more occurrences of the form within parentheses. 
5. postmodification with parenthesis 
Where a rule has several alternatives, this shorthand notation using with abbreviates 
a long sequence of alternatives (here, the many types of parenthesis). 
6. concordant heteropoisal postmodification -> 
concordant postmodification a d heteropoisal postmodification

Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax 
And indicates that all conditions on the right-hand side of a rule must simultaneously 
be satisfied by a single constituent. 
. concordant heteropoisal postmodification > 
nominal group or  prepositional phrase 
Or indicates that any one of the conditions on the right-hand side of a rule must be 
satisfied.
