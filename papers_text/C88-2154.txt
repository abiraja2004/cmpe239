Abstract 
An overview of the DLT (Distributed Language Translation) project 
is given. This project is aimed at a new, multilingual MT system in 
the 1990s, which uses Esperanto asan internal interlingua. The 
system's ,architectural features, current progress and project 
organization are dealt with. 
1. In t roduct ion  
DLT (Distributed Language Translation). is the name of a 
principle, 
a design philosophy and a project. Within the area of MT, it 
represents another approach for steering between the 
hazards of low-quality output, endless prolongation of 
research and development time, restriction to narrowly- 
bounded subject fields, the geometric cost expansion when 
a new language is added, etc. 
DLT is a concentrated high-tech effort to attain a product 
line of language translation modules in the 1990s. 
Together, these modules will constitute an interactive, 
knowledge-based, multilingual translation system, perfecdy 
suited for operation on networked esk-top equipment. 
DLT was conceived in 1979, in an environment with no 
historical ties to MT whatsoever. After patents had been 
applied for in 14 countries, the first publication followed at 
the conference on 
"New Systems and Services in Telecommunications" in 
Liege \[ 1980\]. 
In 1982, the EEC granted aquarter of a million guilders for 
a DLT Feasibility Study, which was completed in 1983. A 
remarkable f ature of the DLT design, highlighted in this 
study, was the use of Esperanto as intermediate language, 
with its own lexicon. This meant he adoption of an overall 
interlingual architecture, the most ambitious structure 
known for an MT system. 
At the same time, the introduction ofEsperanto into the MT 
scene of the 1980s aroused a lot of skepticism and 
prejudice. As it happens, this semi-artificial language 
(invented by an ophthalmo-logist towards the end of the 
nineteenth century) is not usually considered a respectable 
object of study among professional linguists. 
2. Des ign ph i losophy  
The research team at BSO considers Esperanto a valuable 
tool in language technology, and has motivated its use as 
the DLT pivot on rigorous ystems engineering grounds: 
- an overall interlingual rchitecture, i.e. an MT process of 
2 main steps (instead of 3) fits extremely well into the 
outside operating environment, which consists of 'senders' 
and 'receivers' linked by a communications etwork; the 
interlingua (or Intermediate Language) is the 'semi-product' 
passed over the network, and should be independent of any 
source or target language in the system; 
- the knowledge-based component of the translation 
process, 
the world-knowledge inferencing system for resolving 
ambiguities i  essentially language-independent andcan 
therefore ntirely be built in the interlingua; serving a 
multilingual system, this is an important economy-of-scale 
consideration; 
- long-term development and maintenance of a complex 
translation and world knowledge system is a task that can 
only succeed with perfect man-machine interfaces for the 
system engineers; linguists, lexicographers, terminologists 
and other specialists must be offered quick and easy access 
to the heart of the translation machinery; this calls for an 
interlingua that is directlY,legible; 
at the same time, the interlingua should be 
lexicologically autonomous and well-defined, the former 
eliminating the need 
for re-paraphrasing in other languages, the latter 
being a prerequisite for distributed system development 
(language teams working to and from one common 
interlingua); Esperanto meets these requirements. 
3. Prototype const ruct ion  
In 1984, BSO set up a plan for a 6-year research and 
development project (75 person-years at the cost of 18 
million guilders), aimed ata  DLT prototype capable of 
translating atleast one language pair (English-French). This 
plan received the su0port of the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs of the Netherlands, which granted an innovation 
subsidy of 8 million guilders. The first half of this 
6-year schedule has now been completed. 
A first prototype of DLT was shown to the press in 
December 1987. Though operating only slowly as yet, with 
a small vocabulary (2000 English words) and a restricted 
grammar, this laboratory model shows the various 
monolingual and bilingual processing steps of DLT in 
proper sequence \[see also Fig. 1\]: 
1. Exhaustive parsing of the English source text. Two 
different parser implementations have been realized in the 
search for the fastest formalism: one is based on ATNs and 
BSO's graphic software environment (on SUN 3/50 
workstations) developed for setting up, testing and 
optimizing ATNs, the other is based on APSG and the 
PARSPAT software system from the University of 
Amsterdam \[Van der Steen, 1987\]. 
The parsing process in DLT is breadth-first, syntax- 
only, and delivers dependency (not constituency) trees. 
2. Surface translation (first hail). Contrastive syntactic 
rules between English and Esperanto are applied here. This 
system of bilingual rules (250 at present) is based upon 
dependency grammar formalizations of both languages. 
The methodo-logical framework has been inspired by the 
work of the French linguist Tesniere and is 
comprehensively described in \[Schubert, 1987\]. Semantic 
considerations are disregarded systematically at this stage. 
The result is a (sometimes large) number of 'formally 
possible' parallel translations. 
756 
3. Main semantic analysis, entirely carried out in the 
Intermediate Language, by searching through aknowledge 
base of some 75.000 (present status) semantically related 
Esperanto word pairs, and by applying text-grammatical 
principles of cohesion etc. to the intermediate stage of the 
t~rauslated text \[Papegaaij, 1986 and 1988\]. 
This automatic disambiguation system, written in 
Quintus PROLOG, now largely serves as a rating (pre- 
ordering) of parallel surface translations, prior to the 
disambiguation dialogue which follows it. The DLT design 
offers a long. term perspective for steady improvement of
this wobabitistic component, ultimately by machine 
learuing. 
4. Disambigu_ation dialogue. The user is prompted to make 
a choice out of the possible interpretations li ted on the 
screen. Note that these are parallel surface translations, 
backotranslated ('paraphrased') into the source language. 
For the user~ the disambiguation dialogue is a strictly 
monolingual affair, and free of linguistic jargon. In the 
present realization of the DLT prototype, mainly lexical 
ambiguities can be displayed. 
5. Surface tr~nslation (..second half). As Step 2 above, but 
now between tile Intermediate Language and French. Some 
500 contrastive syntactic rules have been implemented so
far. Though the proliferation of parallel translations i  less 
at this side of the translation process (due to the syntactic 
unambiguity of Esperanto and its lack of homonyms), it is 
not absent. If the target lauguage happens to have a more 
refined "cutting..up- of-reality" in some concept area (like 
the proverbial 10 words for 'snow' in Eskimo), parallel 
translations will result. All the results of this step are in the 
form of dependency trees. 
6. Additiomfl semantics. TL-specific selection criteria are 
applied to select he right word. But because these criteria 
are knowledge-based (we are not talking of idiomatic 
phenomena), they are restated in terms of the IL, and the 
selection process is carried out on the intermediate stage of 
the translated text, using the Esperanto knowledge bank 
again, if the context does not provide enough clues, a 
default choic~ (e.g. the least specific word for 'snow') will 
be made. In contrast o the source language half of the 
system, there is no possibility for human intervention here. 
7. ~s i j .  of the target sentence. In this tree-to-string 
conversion, the TL-specific word order is determined 
(including the applicatkm of elision and contraction rules). 
4. Project outlook 
BSO is now in the process of preparing for the next phase 
of the project (budgeted at 12 million guilders), in which 
the emphasis will be on large-scale dictionary and 
knowledge-base expansion, and relaxation of grammar 
restrictions. 
Work done on DLT in the past 5 years confilans the 
feasibility of its architecture and its instrumental use of 
Esperanto. Some of the modifications toEsperanto thought 
necessary \[Witkam, 1983\] in its pivotal MT function 
appeared to be unnecessary aswork on DLT progressed, 
i.e. the Intermediate Language is closer to Esperanto now 
than it looked like in the beginning. Criticizers' predictions 
that the ill_, would keep changing and would drift further 
and further away from Esperanto, have not been borne out. 
The essence of DLT is not so much an attempt at an 
unambiguous intedingua, but rather: a split of the overall 
ITanslation sequence into a form part and a ~ part, in 
which file former is arranged 
as a .~ouLb.~.:dir_L?_~ and the latter as an interlingual /VII" 
pl'oc;ess., 
The doublerdirect process is the surface translation referred 
to above (Steps 2 and 5), which could be loosely 
characterized as ".dumb syntax". The interlingual process 
corresponds Io Steps 3 and 6 above, and contains all the 
8e_r~tics (including knowledge-based inferencing). 
Meanwhile, the share of IL-based or IL-directed work in 
the overall translation sequence - form part as well as 
content part - has increased considerably, compared to the 
initial design of 1982 \[see Fig. 2\]. In the form part, which 
is bilingual and purely syntactic, the Esperanto 1L plays the 
role of "metataxis partner" for every source and target 
language ('metataxis' is tile contrastive-syntactic 
transformation f dependency trees). The content part is 
monolingual, i.e. the semantics i a question of IL-only. It 
goes withont saying that such a design can only succeed by 
virtue of the fact that Esperanto is a well defined language 
on its own, with a well defined syntax and lexicon, and 
with the help of project staff luent in or at least conversant 
with that language. 
The logistics of DLT development draw heavily upon the 
existence of Esperanto resources in the widest sense: 
linguists with Esperanto training, Esperantists with degrees 
in languages or with extensive translator's experience, 
corpora of moderu Esperanto texts, etc. Timely availability 
of these resources in sufficient quantity and quality 
demands ome special organizational nd promotional 
activity from the DLT entrepreneurs. 
This means crossing international borders, including the 
border between EEC and COMECON countries. East 
European countries have a relatively large base of 
Esperanto speakers, and much on-going activity. The 
Budapest Eotvos Lorand University has a chair in 
Esperanto. In Poland, a new Esperanto center connected 
with the University of Bjalistok has been founded in 1987. 
In Bulgaria an international training center exists, and in 
l~'ague an International Center for Esperanto Terminology 
has recently been established. 
The challenge of the DLT project is therefore as much an 
organizational s a technological challenge. Cooperation 
with Hungarian, Finnish and Czech linguists has already 
begun, and preparatory work has been arranged with 
collaborators inEast Asian countries. Diversity of language 
types is a deliberate aim 
for the multilingual DLT system of the 1990s, and tile 
designed architecture makes it technically feasible. It can be 
hoped that, against the background of 'glasnost' and 
'perestrojka', fruitful and effective East-West cooperation 
may add to the success of a system for international use and 
of general interest to the growing community of 
computational linguistics tudents and researchers.
