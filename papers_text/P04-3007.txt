Abstract
We propose a novel method for inducing monolingual
semantic hierarchies and sense clusters from numerous
foreign-language-to-English bilingual dictionaries. The
method exploits patterns of non-transitivity in transla-
tions across multiple languages. No complex or hierar-
chical structure is assumed or used in the input dictio-
naries: each is initially parsed into the ?lowest common
denominator? form, which is to say, a list of pairs of the
form (foreign word, English word). We then propose a
monolingual synonymy measure derived from this ag-
gregate resource, which is used to derive multilingually-
motivated sense hierarchies for monolingual English
words, with potential applications in word sense classifi-
cation, lexicography and statistical machine translation.
1 Introduction
In this work we consider a learning resource compris-
ing over 80 foreign-language-to-English bilingual dictio-
naries, collected by downloading electronic dictionaries
from the Internet and also scanning and running optical
character recognition (OCR) software on paper dictio-
naries. Such a diverse parallel lexical data set has not,
to our knowledge, previously been assembled and exam-
ined in its aggregate form as a lexical semantics training
resource. We show that this aggregate data set admits
of some surprising applications, including discovery of
synonymy relationships between words and automatic
induction of high-quality hierarchical word sense clus-
terings for English.
We perform and describe several experiments deriving
synonyms and sense groupings from the aggregate bilin-
gual dictionary, and subsequently suggest some possible
applications for the results.
Finally, we propose that sense taxonomies of the kind
introduced here, being of different provenance from
those produced explicitly by lexicographers or using un-
supervised corpus-driven methods, have significant value
because they add diversity to the set of available re-
sources.
2 Resources
First we collected, from Internet sources and via scan-
ning and running OCR on print dictionaries, 82 dictio-
naries between English and a total of 44 distinct foreign
languages from a variety of language families.
Over 213K distinct English word types were present
in a total of 5.5M bilingual dictionary entries, for an av-
fair

SS are synonymous with
fair
differing senses of
blond and just

ships among 3 words. The derived synonymy relation S holds between
fair and blond, and between fair and just. S does not hold between
blond and fair. We can infer that fair has at least 2 senses and, further,
we can represent them by blond and just.

ings of fair into distinct senses: blond and just.
erage of 26 and a median of 3 foreign entries per English
word. Roughly 15K English words had at least 100 for-
eign entries; over 64K had at least 10 entries.
No complex or hierarchical structure was assumed or
used in our input dictionaries. Each was initially parsed
into the ?lowest common denominator? form. This con-
sisted of a list of pairs of the form (foreign word, English
word). Because bilingual dictionary structure varies
widely, and even the availability and compatibility of
part-of-speech tags for entries is uncertain, we made the
decision to compile the aggregate resource only with data
that could be extracted from every individual dictionary
into a universally compatible format. The unique pairs
extracted from each dictionary were then converted to 4-
tuples of the form:
<foreign language, dictionary name, foreign word, English word>
before being inserted into the final, combined dictionary
data set.
3 A Synonymy Relation
We began by using the above-described data set to obtain
a synonymy relation between English words.
In general, in a paper bilingual dictionary, each for-
eign word can be associated with a list of English words
which are possible translations; in our reduced format
each entry lists a single foreign word and single possible
English translation, though taking a union of all English
translations for a particular foreign word recreates this
list.
We use the notion of coentry to build the synonymy
relation between English words. The per-entry coentry
count Cper?entry(e1,e2) for two English words e1 and e2
is simply the number of times e1 and e2 both appear as
the translation of the same foreign word (over all foreign
words, dictionaries and languages). The per-dictionary
coentry count Cper?dict(e1,e2), ignores the number
of individual coentries within a particular dictionary
and merely counts as 1 any number of coentries inside
a particular dictionary. Finally, per-language coentry
count Cper?lang(e1,e2) counts as 1 any number of
coentries for e1 and e2 for a particular language. Thus,
for the following snippet from the database:
Eng. Wd. Foreign Wd. Foreign Language Dict. ID
hit schlagen GERMAN ger.dict1
pound schlagen GERMAN ger.dict1
hit schlag GERMAN ger.dict1
pound schlag GERMAN ger.dict1
hit schlag GERMAN ger.dict2
pound schlag GERMAN ger.dict2
hit battere ITAL ital.dict1
pound battere ITAL ital.dict1
Cper?entry(hit,pound) = 4, while
Cper?dict(hit,pound) = 3, since the two individ-
ual coentries in ger.dict1 are only counted once.
Cper?lang(hit,pound) = 2; hit and pound are coentries in
the Italian and German languages. We found the more
conservative per-dictionary and per-language counts to
be a useful device, given that some dictionary creators
appear sometimes to copy and paste identical synonym
sets in a fairly indiscriminate fashion, spuriously
inflating the Cper?entry(e1,e2) counts.
Our algorithm for identifying synonyms was sim-
ple: we sorted all pairs of English words by decreas-
ing Cper?dict(e1,e2) and, after inspection of the resulting
list, cut it off at a per-dictionary and per-language count
threshold1 yielding qualitatively strong results. For all
word pairs e1,e2 above threshold, we say the symmetric
synonymy relation S(e1,e2) holds. The following tables
provide a clarifying example showing how synonymy
can be inferred from multiple bilingual dictionaries in a
way which is impossible with a single such dictionary
(because of idiosyncratic foreign language polysemy).
Lang. Dict. ID Foreign Wd English Translations
GERMAN ger.dict1 absetzen deposit drop deduct sell
GERMAN ger.dict1 ablagerung deposit sediment settlement
The table above displays entries from one
German-English dictionary. How can we tell
that ?sediment? is a better synonym for ?de-
posit? than ?sell?? We can build and examine the

language coentry counts.
coentry counts Cper?lang(deposit,sediment) and
Cper?lang(deposit,sell) using dictionaries from many
languages, as illustrated below:
FRENCH fre.dict1 de?po?t arsenal deposit depository
depot entrusting filing
sludge store trust submission
repository scale sediment
TURKISH tk.dict1 tortu sediment deposit faeces
remainder dregs crust
CZECH cz.dict1 sedlina clot deposit sediment warp
Polysemy which is specific to German ? ?deposit?
and ?sell? senses coexisting in a particular word
form ?absetzen? ? will result in total coentry counts
Cper?lang(deposit,sell), over all languages and dictio-
naries, which are low. In fact, ?deposit? and ?sell?
are coentries under only 2 out of 44 languages in our
database (German and Swedish, which are closely re-
lated). On the other hand, near-synonymous English
translations of a particular sense across a variety of lan-
guages will result in high coentry counts, as is the case
with Cper?lang(deposit,sediment). As illustrated in the
tables, German, French, Czech and Turkish all support
the synonymy hypothesis for this pair of English words.
?deposit? Coentries Per Entry Per Dict. Per Lang.
sell 4 4 2
sediment 68 40 18
The above table, listing the various coentry counts
for ?deposit?, demonstrates the empirical motivation in
the aggregate dictionary for the synonymy relationship
between deposit and sediment, while the aggregate ev-
idence of synonymy between deposit and sell is weak,
limited to 2 languages, and is most likely the result of a
word polysemy restricted to a few Germanic languages.
4 Different Senses: Asymmetries of
Synonymy Relations
After constructing the empirically derived synonymy re-
lation S described in the previous section, we observed
that one can draw conclusions from the topology of the
graph of S relationships (edges) among words (vertices).
Specifically, consider the case of three words e1,e2, e3
for which S(e1,e2) and S(e1,e3) hold, but S(e2,e3) does
not. Figure 1 illustrates this situation with an example
from data (e1 = ?fair?), and more examples are listed
in Table 1. As Figure 1 suggests and inspection of the
random extracts presented in Table 1 will confirm, this
topology can be interpreted as indicating that e2 and e3
exemplify differing senses of e1.
We decided to investigate and apply it with more gen-
erality. This will be discussed in the next section.
5 Inducing Sense Taxonomies: Clustering
with Synonym Similarity
With the goal of using the aggregate bilingual dictionary
to induce interesting and useful sense distinctions of En-
glish words, we investigated the following strategy.
syn1(W) W syn2(W)
quiet still yet
desire want lack
delicate tender offer
conceal hide skin
nice kind sort
assault charge load
filter strain stretch
flow run manage
cloth fabric structure
blond fair just
foundation base ignoble
deny decline fall
hurl cast mould
bright clear open
harm wrong incorrect
crackle crack fissure
impeach charge load
enthusiastic keen sharp
coarse rough difficult
fling cast form
firm fast speedy
fashion mold mildew
incline lean meagre
arouse raise increase
digit figure shape
dye paint picture
spot stain tincture
shape cast toss
claim call shout
earth ground groundwork
associate fellow guy
arrest stop plug
Table 1: A representative sampling of high-confidence sense
distinctions derived via unbalanced synonymy relationships among
three words, W and two of its synonyms syn1(W) & syn2(W),
such that Cper?dict(W,syn1(W)) and Cper?dict(W,syn2(W)) are
high, whereas Cper?dict(syn1(W),syn2(W)) is low (0). Ex-
tracted from a list sorted by descending Cper?dict(W,syn1(W))
? Cper?dict(W,syn2(W)) / Cper?dict(syn1(W),syn2(W)) (counts
were smoothed to prevent division by zero).
For each target word Wt in English having a suffi-
ciently high dictionary occurrence count to allow inter-
esting results2, a list of likely synonym words Ws was
induced by the method described in Section 33. Addi-
tionally, we generated a list of all words Wc having non-
zero Cper?dict(Wt,Wc).
The synonym words Ws ? the sense exemplars for
target words Wt ? were clustered based on vectors of
coentry counts Cper?dict(Ws,Wc). This restriction on
vector dimension to only words that have nonzero co-
entries with the target word helps to exclude distractions
such as coentries of Ws corresponding to a sense which
doesn?t overlap with Wt. The example given in the fol-
lowing table shows an excerpt of the vectors for syn-
onyms of strike. The hit synonym overlaps strike in the
beat/bang/knock sense. Restricting the vector dimension
as described will help prevent noise from hit?s common
2For our experiments, English words occurring in at least 15 distinct
source dictionaries were considered.

chart-topper/recording/hit single sense. The following
table also illustrates the clarity with which major sense
distinctions are reflected in the aggregate dictionary. The
induced clustering for strike (tree as well as flat cluster
boundaries) is presented in Figure 4.

attack - 4 18 7 0 0
bang - 38 43 2 0 0
hit - 44 2 29
knock - 2 0
walkout - 0
find -
We used the CLUTO clustering toolkit (Karypis,
2002) to induce a hierarchical agglomerative clustering
on the vectors for Ws. Example results for vital and
strike are in Figures 3 and 4 respectively4. Figure 4 also
presents flat clusters automatically derived from the tree,
as well as a listing of some foreign words associated with
particular clusters.

6 Related Work
There is a distinguished history of research extracting lexical
semantic relationships from bilingual dictionaries (Copestake
et al, 1995; Chen and Chang, 1998). There is also a long-
standing goal of mapping translations and senses in multiple
languages in a linked ontology structure (Resnik and Yarowsky,
1997; Risk, 1989; Vossen, 1998). The recent work of Ploux and
Ji (2003) has some similarities to the techniques presented here
in that it considers topological properties of the graph of syn-
onymy relationships between words. The current paper can be
distinguished on a number of dimensions, including our much
greater range of participating languages, and the fundamental
algorithmic linkage between multilingual translation distribu-
tions and monolingual synonymy clusters.
4In both ?vital? and ?strike? examples, the rendered hierarchical
clusterings were pruned (automatically) in order to fit in this paper.

automatically derived from the tree are denoted by the horizontal lines.
7 Analysis and Conclusions
This is the first presentation of a novel method for the induc-
tion of word sense inventories, which makes use of aggregate
information from a large collection of bilingual dictionaries.
One possible application of the induced sense inventories
presented here is as an aid to manual construction of mono-
lingual dictionaries or thesauri, motivated by translation dis-
tinctions across numerous world languages. While the desired
granularity of sense distinction will vary according to the re-
quirements of taste and differing applications, treating our out-
put as a proposal to be assessed and manually modified would
be a valuable labor-saving tool for lexicographers.
Another application of this work is a supplemental resource
for statistical machine translation (SMT). It is possible, as
shown graphically in Figure 4, to recover the foreign words
associated with a cluster (not just a single word). Given that
the clusters provide a more complete coverage of English word
types for a given sense than the English side of a particular
bilingual dictionary, clusters could be used to unify bitext co-
occurrence counts of foreign words with English senses in a
way that typical bilingual dictionaries cannot. Unifying counts
in this way would be a useful way of reducing data sparsity in
SMT training.
Finally, evaluation of induced sense taxonomies is always
problematic. First of all, there is no agreed ?correct? way to
classify the possible senses of a particular word. To some de-
gree this is because human experts disagree on particular judg-
ments of classification, though a larger issue, as pointed out
in Resnik and Yarowsky 1997, is that what constitutes an ap-
propriate set of sense distinctions for a word is, emphatically, a
function of the task at hand. The sense-distinction requirements
of English-to-French machine translation differ from those of
English-to-Arabic machine translation (due to differing degrees
of parallel polysemy across the language pairs), and both differ
from those of English dictionary construction.
We believe that the translingually-motivated word-sense tax-
onomies developed here will prove useful for the a variety
of tasks including those mentioned above. The fact that they
are derived from a novel resource, not constructed explicitly
by humans or derived in fully unsupervised fashion from text
corpora, makes them worthy of study and incorporation in fu-
ture lexicographic, machine translation, and word sense disam-
biguation efforts.
