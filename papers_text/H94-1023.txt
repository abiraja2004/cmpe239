About 2~ years ago, ARPA initiated a new program in 
Machine Translation (MT). Three projects were funded: 
CANI)II)E, built by IBM in New York; I,INGSTA'I~, built by 
Dragon Systems in Boston; and PAN(;I,()SS, a collabora- 
tion of the Computing Research Laboratory at New Mex- 
ico State University, the Center for Machine Translation at 
Carnegie Mellon University, and the Information Sciences 
Institute of the University of Southern California. All but 
one of the papers in this section is directly related to these 
systems. In one way or another, each paper addresses one of 
the following two major dimensions of variation: basic ap. 
proach (i.e., operation and data collection by statistical vs. 
symbolic means) and depth of analysis (i.e., direct replace- 
ment, transfer, or interlingual). This overview first explains 
these terms and then describes the import of the papers. 
Basic Approach 
Over the past six years, the CANI)nn)I,: group at IBM has 
gained some impressive results, and considerable notori- 
ety, by performing MT employing only statistical, non- 
linguistic, methods. Using cross-language correspondences 
collected statistically from 3m sentences of the Canadian 
Parliamentary records, which are bilingual French and 
English, c:Asnm)n,~ operates by replacing portions of each 
French input sentence with the statistically most appro- 
priate English equivalent, aking the whole sentence into 
account, and then ~smoothing ~ the resulting words and 
phrases into the most probable grammatical English sen- 
tence. 
In contrast, the PAN(iI,OSS system takes a more tradi- 
tional symbolic approach, involving linguistic and semantic 
knowledge resources such as grammars of Spanish and En- 
glish, a library of ~semantic ~ symbols that can be composed 
to represent the ~meaning = of each sentence, and a variety 
of process modules, such as sentence parsers, analyzers, and 
generators, that employ these resources to convert informa- 
tion from one form (say, a Spanish sentence) to another 
(say, a syntactic parse tree of that sentence). 
The i,zN(;s'n'^'l' system, as its name suggests, is a hybrid, 
involving linguistic-symbolic information for some subtasks 
and statistical information for others. 
Depth of  Analysis 
The basic theoretical underpinnings of MT involve the 
amount of analysis performed on the input (source lan- 
guage) sentence during the process of converting it to the 
output (target language) sentence (since almost all MT sys- 
tems work on a sentence by sentence basis, multisentence 
complexities are ignored here). In the simplest possible 
translation method, asystem simply pattern-matches (por- 
tions of) each input sentence against a bilingual replace- 
ment dictionary and replaces each portion with its target 
language quivalent. The result is usually massaged in vari- 
ous ways in order to achieve some degree of grammaticality. 
A major problem with this approach is the immensity of 
the replacement dictionary required: since no generaliza- 
tions are represented, the dictionary needs distinct entries 
for each form of each word (see, sees, saw, seen, or book, 
books, etc.). Even a rudimentary generalization (e.g., stor- 
ing in the replacement dictionary only the root forms of 
words) can have a large effect. However, this move comes 
at the cost of creating two new programs: one program on 
the input side that recognizes each source language inflected 
word and replaces it by its root form plus a pseudo-word 
that carries the additional (number, tense, etc.) informa- 
tion, and another program on the output side that appro- 
priately inflects the replacement root form according to the 
information in the pseudo-word. 
Once you have embarked on this route of analysis, the 
next step is to notice that languages exhibit syntactic reg- 
ularities that map regularly. For example, in English the 
ractive" verb appears in what one can call "second posi- 
tion', while in Japanese it appears at the end of the sen- 
tence. Without knowing which word is the verb, a direct 
replacement system has no way in general of reposition- 
ing it correctly during translation. However, at the cost 
of writing two more programs, a syntactic parser (input) 
and a generator (output), and creating rules that specify 
how the syntactic wordclasses (verb, noun, etc.) map over 
from one language to another, you can greatly improve the 
quality of the translation, since now you get grammatical 
sentences. This move involves ome effort: though by now 
basic parsing and generation technology is fairly well un- 
derstood, writing adequately large grammars of languages 
is a daunting task; no complete grammar has so far been 
written of any natural anguage. 
It is clear on a moment's reflection, however, that trans- 
lation on purely syntactic grounds is bound to fail in many 
instances; think of simple lexical ambiguity by which "the 
chair called for order" is translated as ~the stool called for 
command', still grammatically correct. Adequate transla- 
tion obviously requires ome sensitivity to the meaning of 
the source text. That is, to improve the quality of transla- 
tion ever further, you have to write semantic analyzer and 
generator programs and develop an internal meaning rep- 
resentation notation, upon which you can unleash inference 
rules about how word meanings combine (disallowing ~call" 
to take inanimate agents, for example). Here the central is- 
sue is constructing an adequately large and expressive set 
of meaning representation symbols. Ideally, these symbols 
would be independent of any human language; they would 
constitute the symbols of what is called in MT the Interlin- 
133 
~Ua. 
One advantage of Interlingual systems is the fact that 
they c~m be significantly cheaper to extend to handle new 
languages. MT systems that use transfer rules to specify 
how the intermediate representations map from one lan- 
guage to another require order n 2 sets of mapping rules 
for n l~mguages (one set of rules between each pair of lan- 
guages). Interlingual systems, on the other hand, need only 
order ~; rules, just between each language and the Interlin- 
gua. When the number of transfer ules between any two 
languages exceeds 1,000, the cost of developing an interlin- 
gua starts looking attractive. 
The  Papers  
The first paper in this session, by White and O'Connell, is 
the one that ties everything together. White and O'Connell 
have been retained by ARPA to administer the frequent 
(on average, every 8 months) evaluations of the MT sys- 
tems. These evaluations have grown from relatively small 
(the first involved the three ARPA contractors and three 
or four additional systems) to fairly large (the most recent, 
of January-February 1994, involved 19 systems). In their 
paper, White and O'Connell describe the three major eval- 
uation criteria and then provide the systems' scores for the 
evaluation of May-August 1993. 
PAN(~,,OSS is a symbolic system at heart, although some 
of its newer components, and many of its knowledge acqui- 
sition efforts, are of a more statistical or semi-automated 
flavor. The paper by Okumura and Hovy addresses the core 
problem of linking a large wordiist used by the JtJMAN mod- 
ule to separate words in the input Japanese text to the sys- 
tem's Ontology (its interlingua lexicon). Since the wordlist 
contains over 100,000 items and the Ontology over 70,000, 
this linkage cannot be done manually. The algorithms out- 
lined employ a bilingual Japanese-English dictionary as a 
abridge". PAN(;,.OSS has undergone other changes as well. 
It was originally designed as a pure interlingual system, but 
now includes (as is described in the paper by Nirenburg and 
Frederking) several MT engines, one of which (lexical trans- 
fer) is essentially direct replacement technology. With such 
a multi-engine system, a central problem is reconciling the 
various engines' outputs; this paper describes how the best 
translation is selected by a chart-walk algorithm using dy- 
namic programming techniques to find an optimal cover. 
The paper by Smadja and McKeown describes work not 
at present used in an MT system, though its result is clearly 
intended to be. The issue is how automatically to construct 
bilingual phrase (i.e., multi-word collocation) dictionaries 
from & bilingual aligned text corpus. Like the CANI)II)E 
system, Smadja and McKeown use the Canadian Parlia- 
mentary records for their statisticaJly based identification 
first of the longest multi-word sequence that appears with 
high enough frequency to be a true phrase, in one of the 
languages, and then find its trahslational equivalence(s) in
the other. They argue that the Dice coefficient is the most 
suitable for their purpose. 
The third ARPA-funded system, ,,NC;S'O'A'O', is an interac- 
tive machine-aided translation system that helps the user 
compose a high-quality translation from Japanese to En- 
gUsh. Architecturally designed along more symbolic lines, 
the system contains a tokenizer/de-inflector, a syntactic 
parser, and a word-order re-arranger. As such, it is a classic 
transfer system. Each of these modules, however, employs 
knowledge collected and used in the statistics paradigm. 
The bulk of the paper describes the automated construc- 
tion of a lexically based word sequence grammar. 
The final paper, by Berger et al, describes IBM's CAN- 
,),,~: system. In its simplest original form, (:AN,~mI,~ was 
a pure direct replacement system, for which various kinds 
of French-Engiish equivalencies had been collected statisti- 
cally and captured in a so-called Translation Model. Over 
the past two years, it has become an increasingly sophisti- 
cated transfer system, as its developers build more morpho- 
logical, \]exical, and syntactic knowledge into more complex 
models: equivalent words, fertility (the number of English 
words corresponding to a French one), word and word-class 
alignment correspondences, etc. Thus while CANI)II)E re- 
mains a statistical system at heart, some of the rules or 
knowledge it uses, especially during early processing, are 
symboIic/linguistic in nature.
