Abstract 
We describe our efforts to apply the Penn 
Discourse Treebank guidelines on a Tamil 
corpus to create an annotated corpus of dis-
course relations in Tamil. After conducting 
a preliminary exploratory study on Tamil 
discourse connectives, we show our obser-
vations and results of a pilot experiment 
that we conducted by annotating a small 
portion of our corpus. Our ultimate goal is 
to develop a Tamil Discourse Relation 
Bank that will be useful as a resource for 
further research in Tamil discourse. Fur-
thermore, a study of the behavior of dis-
course connectives in Tamil will also help 
in furthering the cross-linguistic under-
standing of discourse connectives. 
1 Introduction 
The study of discourse structure in natural lan-
guage processing has its applications in emerging 
fields such as coherence evaluation, question an-
swering, natural language generation and textual 
summarization. Such a study is possible in a given 
human language only if there are sufficient dis-
course annotated resources available for that lan-
guage. The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a 
project whose goal is to annotate the discourse re-
lations holding between events described in a text. 
The PDTB is a lexically grounded approach where 
discourse relations are anchored in lexical items 
wherever they are explicitly realized in the text 
(Miltsakaki et al 2004, Prasad et al, 2008). To 
foster cross-linguistic studies in discourse rela-
tions, projects similar to the PDTB in discourse 
annotation were initiated in Czech (Mladov? et al, 
2008), Chinese (Xue, 2005), Turkish (Zeyrek and 
Webber, 2008) and Hindi (Prasad et al, 2008). We 
explore how the underlying framework and annota-
tion guidelines apply to Tamil, a morphologically 
rich, agglutinative, free word order language. 
In this paper, we present how a corpus of Tamil 
texts was created on which we performed our pilot 
experiment. Next, in Section 3 we cover the basics 
of the PDTB guidelines that we followed during 
our annotation process. In Section 4, we show var-
ious categories of Tamil discourse connectives that 
we identified after a preliminary study on dis-
course connectives in Tamil, illustrating each with 
examples. In Section 5, we discuss some interest-
ing issues specific to Tamil that we encountered 
during discourse annotation and present the results 
of the pilot experiment that we performed on our 
source corpus. We conclude this paper in Section 6 
by discussing about challenges that were unique to 
our work and our plans for the future. 
2 Source Corpus 
We collected Tamil encyclopedia articles from the 
June 2008 edition of the Wikipedia static HTML 
dumps1. Elements such as HTML metadata, navi-
gational links, etc. were then removed until only 
the text of the articles remained. A corpus was then 
built by collecting the texts from all the articles in 
the dump. The corpus thus created consists of

about 2.2 million words from approximately 
200,000 sentences. 
Since the texts used in building the corpus were 
all encyclopedia articles featured in the Tamil lan-
guage version of Wikipedia, the corpus covers a 
wide variety of topics including arts, culture, biog-
raphies, geography, society, history, etc., written 
and edited by volunteers from around the world. 
3 Penn Discourse Treebank Guidelines  
The PDTB is a resource built on discourse struc-
ture in (Webber and Joshi, 1998) where discourse 
connectives are treated as discourse-level predi-
cates that always take exactly two abstract objects 
such as events, states and propositions as their ar-
guments. We now describe the types of connec-
tives and their senses from the PDTB framework 
and provide examples from Tamil sentences. 
3.1 Annotation Process 
The process of discourse annotation involves iden-
tifying discourse connectives in raw text and then 
annotating their arguments and semantics. Dis-
course connectives are identified as being explicit, 
implicit, AltLex, EntRel or NoRel (Prasad et al 
2008). These classes are described in detail in Sec-
tion 4. By convention, annotated explicit connec-
tives are underlined and implicit connectives are 
shown by the marker, ?(Implicit=)?. As can be 
seen in example (1), one of the arguments is shown 
enclosed between {} and the other argument is 
shown in []. The AltLex, EntRel or NoRel relations 
are shown by underlining, i.e., as ?(AltLex=)?, 
?(EntRel)? and ?(NoRel)?, respectively. 
 
(1) {eN kAl uDaindadaN}Al [eNNAl viLayADa 
muDiyAdu].  
?{My leg broke}, hence [I cannot play].? 
 
3.2 Sense Hierarchy 
The semantics of discourse relations are termed as 
senses and are then classified hierarchically using 
four top-level classes ?Comparison?, ?Contingen-
cy?, ?Expansion? and ?Temporal?. Each class is 
refined by its component types and these, in turn, 
are further refined by the subtype level. 
It is interesting to note that some connectives 
have multiple senses. In example (2) the affixed ?
um connective carries the sense of type Expan-
sion:Conjunction ?also? whereas in example (3) the 
same affix carries the sense of the subtype Contin-
gency:Concession ?however?.

?{By this, he became the tenth player to cross 
nine thousand runs in one-day internationals}. 
[He] also [attained the record of becoming the 
first South African player to cross these many

adAgum.]  
?Though {two more teams participated when 
compared to last Cricket World Cup}, [the total 
matches played during this time were fewer].? 
 
4 Discourse Connectives in Tamil 
Tamil is an agglutinative language where mor-
phemes are affixed to the roots of individual 
words, a trait that it shares with many other Dra-
vidian languages and languages like Turkish, Esto-
nian and Japanese. Here, each affix represents 
information such as discourse connective, gender, 
number, etc. We now describe how we try to cap-
ture various types of Tamil discourse connectives 
using a proposed scheme which is based on the 
existing PDTB guidelines proposed by (Prasad et 
al., 2007). 
 
4.1 Explicit Discourse Connectives 
 
Explicit discourse connectives are lexical items 
present in text that are used to anchor the discourse 
relations portrayed by them. In Tamil, they are 
found as affixes to the verb, as in example (4) 
where the affix -Al conveys the meaning ?so?. This 
is in a way similar to the simplex subordinators in 
Turkish, as described in (Zeyrek and Webber, 
2008). However, like in English, explicit discourse 
connectives are also realized as unbound lexical 
items, as can be seen in example (5) where the 
word eNavE means ?hence?. 
 
120
(4) {avaradu uDalnalam sariyillAmaiy}Al [nAngu 
mAdangaL avarAl viLayADa iyalavillai].  
?{He was suffering from ill health} so [he 
could not play for four months].? 
(5)  {tirukkuraL aNaittu madattiNarum paDittu 
payaNaDaiyum vagaiyil ezudappattuLLadu}. 
eNavE [innUl palarAl pArAttappaDuginradu]. 
?{Thirukkural has been written in such a way 
that people from all religions can benefit from 
it}. Hence, [this book is praised by many].? 
 
Syntactically, explicit connectives can be coordi-
nating conjunctions e.g., alladu (?or?), subordinat-
ing conjunctions e.g., -Al (?so?), sentential relatives 
e.g., -adaNAl (?because of which?), particles e.g., -
um (?also?) or adverbials e.g., -pOdu (?just then?). 
 
Explicit connectives also occur as conjoined 
connectives where two or more instances of con-
nectives share the same two arguments. Such con-
nectives are annotated as distinct types and are 
annotated discontinuously, as seen in example (6) 
where the connectives -um and -um are paired to-
gether to share the same arguments.  
 
(6)  {mANavargaLukku sattuNavu aLikkav}um 
[avargaL sariyAga uDarpayirchi seiyyav]um 
arasup paLLigaL udava vENDum. 
?Government schools should help in {providing 
nutritious food to the students} and [making 
sure they perform physical exercises]. 
 
4.2 Implicit Discourse Connectives 
 
Implicit discourse connectives are inserted be-
tween adjacent sentence pairs that are not related 
explicitly by any of the syntactically defined set of 
explicit connectives. In such a case, we attempted 
to infer a discourse relation between the sentences 
and a connective expression that best conveys the 
inferred relation is inserted. In example (7), the 
implicit expression uthAraNamAga (?for example?) 
has been inserted as an inferred discourse relation 
between the two sentences. 
 
 (7)  {IyOrA iNa makkaLiN moziyil irundu iNru 
Angilattil vazangum sorkaL uLLaNa}. (Implic-
it=uthAraNamAga) [dingO, vUmErA, vAlabi 
pONra sorkaL IyOravilirindu tONriya sorkaL 
dAN]. 
  ?{There are words that are present in English 
that originated from the language of the Eora 
people}. (Implicit= For example) [Dingo, 
Woomera and Wallaby are words with their or-
igins in Eora].? 
 
4.3 AltLex, EntRel and NoRel 
 
In cases where no implicit connective was appro-
priately found to be placed between adjacent sen-
tence-pairs, we now look at three distinct classes. 
AltLex relations, as seen in example (8) are dis-
course relations where the insertion of an implicit 
connective leads to a redundancy in its expression 
as the relation is already alternatively lexicalized 
by some other expression that cannot be labeled as 
an explicit connective. Example (9) shows an En-
tRel relation where no discourse relation can be 
inferred and the second sentence provides further 
description of an entity realized in the first sen-
tence. When neither a discourse relation nor entity-
based coherence can be inferred between the two 
adjacent sentences, it is described as a NoRel, 
shown in example (10). 
 
(8) {mudalAvadAga mAgim, jOgEshwari, 
pUrivilla rayil nilayangaLil guNDu vedittadu}. 
(AtlLex=idai toDarndu) [mErku rayilvEyiN 
aNaittu rayilgaLum niruttappaTTaNa]. 
 ?{Initially, bombs exploded in Mahim, Joge-
shwari and Poorivilla}. (AltLex=following 
this) [all the trains from the western railway 
were halted].? 
(9) {ivvANDu kirikket ulagakkOppai mErkindiyat

  ?{This year?s Cricket World Cup was held in

petition, the teams representing the sixteen na-
tions were grouped into four groups with four

?{Sachin Tendulkar is considered the best

5 Observations and Results 
5.1 Combined connectives 
There is a paired connective -um ? -um (?) that 
sometimes expresses an Expansion:Conjunction 
relation between the events where each -um is suf-
fixed to the verb that describes each event (see ex-
ample (6)). Also, there is a connective -Al which 
usually never occurs more than once and some-
times expresses a Contingency:Cause relation be-
tween two events. 
It is interesting to see that in sentences like 
(11), the -Al combines with the -um ? -um to ex-
press something like a new type of relation. In the 
process, the -um ? -um causes the -Al, which is 
usually not doubled, to become doubled, thereby 
forming an -Alum ? -Alum. We call this special 
type of connectives as combined connectives, as 
shown in example (11). 
 
(11)  {kirikket viLayADiyad}Alum {uDarpayirci 
seidad}Alum [sOrvaDaindEN]. 
?Because {I played cricket} and because {I did 
exercise} [I am tired].? 
 
5.2 Redundant connectives 
The connective -O ? -O (?) that conveys a dubi-
tative relation also combines with the -Al connec-
tive in a way similar to what was shown in Section 
5.1 to form the combined connective -AlO ? -AlO 
(?). 
However, in example (12), alladu, an equiva-
lent of the -O ? -O connective has also occurred in 
addition to the combined -AlO ? -AlO connective. 
This may be purely redundant, or could serve a 
purpose to emphasize the dubitative relation ex-
pressed by both alladu and -O ? -O. 
 
(12)  {pOtti samappatt}AlO alladu {muDivu pera-
paDAmal pON}AlO [piNvarum muraigaL mU-
lam aNigaL tarappaDuttapaDum]. 
?If {a game is tied} or if {there is no result}, 
[the qualified teams are chosen using the fol-
lowing rules].? 
5.3 Results of Pilot Study 
In this experiment, we looked at 511 sentences 
from the corpus mentioned in Section 2 and anno-
tated a total of 323 connectives. Table 1 shows the 
distribution of the annotated connectives across the 
different types such as Explicit, Implicit, EntRel, 
AltLex and NoRel.

NoRel 2 - 0.6 - 
 
Table 1: Results of Pilot Experiment 
 
While a higher percentage of the connectives 
annotated are those of the Explicit type, it can also 
be seen that there is a higher proportion of unique 
connectives in the Implicit and AltLex types. Note 
that since EntRel and NoRel connectives are not 
associated with a sense relation or a lexical item, 
their counts are left blank. 
6 Challenges and Future Work 
The agglutinative nature of the Tamil language 
required a deeper analysis to look into suffixes that 
act as discourse connectives in addition to those 
that occur as unbounded lexical items. We also 
found certain interesting examples that were dis-
tinct from those observed during similar approach-
es in relatively less morphologically rich languages 
like English. 
While this was a first attempt at creating a dis-
course annotated Tamil corpus, we are planning to 
conduct future work involving multiple annotators 
which would yield information on annotation met-
rics like inter-annotator agreement, for example. 
Our work and results would also be useful for 
similar approaches in other morphologically rich 
and related South Indian languages such as Mala-
yalam, Kannada, Telugu, etc. 
We will also work on a way in which the dis-
course annotations have been performed will help 
in augmenting the information provided during 
dependency annotations at the sentence-level.
