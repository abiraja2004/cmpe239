In this paper we present an approach to the dis- 
ambiguation of capitalized words when they are 
used in the positions where capitalization is ex- 
pected, such as the first word in a sentence or 
after a period, quotes, etc.. Such words can act 
as proper names or can be just capitalized vari- 
ants of common words. The main feature of 
our approach is that it uses a minimum of pre- 
built resources and tries to dynamically infer 
the disambiguation clues from the entire docu- 
ment. The approach was thoroughly tested and 
achieved about 98.5% accuracy on unseen texts 
from The New York Times 1996 corpus. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Disambiguation of capitalized words in mixed- 
case texts has hardly received much attention 
in the natural language processing and infor- 
mation retrieval communities, but in fact it 
plays an important role in many tasks. Cap- 
italized words usually denote proper names - 
names of organizations, locations, people, arti- 
facts, etc. - but there are also other positions in 
the text where capitalization is expected. Such 
ambiguous positions include the first word in 
a sentence, words in all-capitalized titles or ta- 
ble entries, a capitalized word after a colon or 
open quote, the first capitalized word in a list- 
entry, etc. Capitalized words in these and some 
other positions present a case of ambiguity -
they can stand for proper names as in "White 
later said ...", or they can be just capitalized 
common words as in "White elephants are ...". 
Thus the disambiguation of capitalized words in 
the ambiguous positions leads to the identifica- 
tion of proper names I and in this paper we will 
* Also at HCRC, University of Edinburgh 
1This is not entirely true - adjectives derived from lo- 
cations such as American, French, etc., are always writ- 
use these two terms interchangeably. Note that 
this task, does not involve the classification of 
proper names into semantic ategories (person, 
organization, location, etc.) which is the objec- 
tive of the Named Entity Recognition task. 
Many researchers observed that commonly 
used upper/ lower case normalization does not 
necessarily help document retrieval. Church in 
(Church, 1995) among other simple text nor- 
malization techniques tudied the effect of case 
normalization for different words and showed 
that "...sometimes case variants refer to the 
same thing (hurricane and Hurricane), some- 
times they refer to different things (continental 
and Continental) and sometimes they don't re- 
fer to much of anything (e.g. anytime and Any- 
time)." Obviously these differences are due to 
the fact that some capitalized words stand for 
proper names (such as Continental- the name 
of an airline) and some don't. 
Proper names are the main concern of the 
Named Entity Recognition subtask (Chinchor, 
1998) of Information Extraction. There the dis- 
ambiguation of the first word of a sentence (and 
in other ambiguous positions) is one of the cen- 
tral problems. For instance, the word "Black" 
in the sentence-initial position can stand for 
a person's surname but can also refer to the 
colour. Even in multi-word capitalized phrases 
the first word can belong to the rest of the 
phrase or can be just an external modifier. In 
the sentence "Daily, Mason and Partners lost 
their court case" it is clear that "Daily, Mason 
and Partners" is the name of a company. In the 
sentence "Unfortunately, Mason and Partners 
lost their court case" the name of the company 
does not involve the word "unfortunately", but 
ten capitalized but in fact can stand for an adjective 
(American president) as well as a proper noun (he was 
an American). 
159 
the word "Daily" is just as common a word as 
"unfortunately". 
Identification of proper names is also impor- 
tant in Machine Translation because normally 
proper names hould be transliterated (i.e. pho- 
netically translated) rather than properly (se- 
mantically) translated. In confidential texts, 
such as medical records, proper names must be 
identified and removed before making such texts 
available to unauthorized people. And in gen- 
eral, most of the tasks which involve different 
kinds of text analysis will benefit from the ro- 
bust disambiguation of capitalized words into 
proper names and capitalized common words. 
Despite the obvious importance of this prob- 
lem, it was always considered part of larger 
tasks and, to  the authors' knowledge, was not 
studied closely with full attention. In the part- 
of-speech tagging field, the disambiguation of 
capitalized words is treated similarly to the 
disambiguation of common words. However, 
as Church (1988) rightly pointed out "Proper 
nouns and capitalized words are particularly 
problematic: some capitalized words are proper 
nouns and some are not. Estimates from the 
Brown Corpus can be misleading. For exam- 
ple, the capitalized word "Acts" is found twice 
in Brown Corpus, both times as a proper noun 
(in a title). It would be misleading to infer 
from this evidence that the word "Acts" is al- 
ways a proper noun." Church then proposed to 
include only high frequency capitalized words 
in the lexicon and also label words as proper 
nouns if they are "adjacent o" other capital- 
ized words. For the rest of capitalized common 
words he suggested that a small probability of 
proper noun interpretation should be assumed 
and then one should hope that the surrounding 
context will help to make the right assignment. 
This approach is successful for some cases but, 
as we pointed out above, a sentence-initial cap- 
italized word which is adjacent o other capital- 
ized words is not necessarily a part of a proper 
name, and also many common nouns and plural 
nouns can be used as proper names (e.g. Rid- 
ers) and their contextual expectations are not 
too different from their usual parts of speech. 
In the Information Extraction field the dis- 
ambiguation of capitalized words in the am- 
biguous positions was always tightly linked to 
the classification of the proper names into se- 
mantic classes such as person name, location, 
company name, etc. and to the resolution of 
coreference between the identified and classi- 
fied proper names. This gave rise to the meth- 
ods which aim at these tasks simultaneously. 
(Mani&MacMillan, 1995) describe a method 
of using contextual clues such as appositives 
("PERSON, the daughter of a prominent local 
physician") and felicity conditions for identify- 
ing names. The contextual clues themselves are 
then tapped for data concerning the referents 
of the names. The advantage of this approach 
is that these contextual clues not only indicate 
whether a capitalized word is a proper name, 
but they also determine its semantic lass. The 
disadvantage of this method is in the cost and 
difficulty of building a wide-coverage s t of con- 
textual clues and the dependence of these con- 
textual clues on the domain and text genre. 
Contextual clues are very sensitive to the spe- 
cific lexical and syntactic onstructions and the 
clues developed for the news-wire texts are not 
useful for legal or medical texts. 
In this paper we present a novel approach to 
the problem of capitalized word disambiguation. 
The main feature of our approach is that it uses 
a minimum of pre-built resources and tries to 
dynamically infer the disambiguation clues from 
the entire document under processing. This 
makes our approach domain and genre inde- 
pendent and thus inexpensive to apply when 
dealing with unrestricted texts. This approach 
was used in a named entity recognition system 
(Mikheev et al, 1998) where it proved to be 
one of the key factors in the system achieving a
nearly human performance in the 7th Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC'7) evaluation 
(Chinchor, 1998). 
2 Bot tom-L ine  Per fo rmance  
In general, the disambiguation of capitalized 
words in the mixed case texts doesn't seem to 
be too difficult: if a word is capitalized in an un- 
ambiguous position, e.g., not after a period or 
other punctuation which might require the fol- 
lowing word to be capitalized (such as quotes or 
brackets), it is a proper name or part of a multi- 
word proper name. However, when a capitalized 
word is used in a position where it is expected 
to be capitalized, for instance, after a period or 
in a title, our task is to decide whether it acts

as a proper name or as the expected capitalized 
common word. 
The first obvious strategy for deciding 
whether a capitalized word in an ambiguous po- 
sition is a proper name or not is to apply lexi- 
con lookup (possibly enhanced with a morpho- 
logical word guesser, e.g., (Mikheev, 1997)) and 
mark as proper names the words which are not 
listed in the lexicon of common words. Let us 
investigate this strategy in more detail: In our 
experiments we used a corpus of 100 documents 
(64,337 words) from The New York Times 1996. 
This corpus was balanced to represent different 
domains and was used for the formal test run 
of the 7th Message Understanding Conference 
(MUC'7) (Chinchor, 1998) in the Named En- 
tity Recognition task. 
First we ran a simple zoner which identi- 
fied ambiguous positions for capitalized words - 
capitalized words after a period, quotes, colon, 
semicolon, in all-capital sentences and titles 
and in the beginnings of itemized list entries. 
The 64,337-word corpus contained 2,677 cap- 
italized words in ambiguous positions, out of 
which 2,012 were listed in the lexicon of En- 
glish common words. Ten common words were 
not listed in the lexicon and not guessed by our 
morphological guesser: "Forecasters", "Bench- 
mark", "Eeverybody", "Liftoff", "Download- 
ing", "Pretax", "Hailing", "Birdbrain", "Opt- 
ing" and "Standalone". In all our experiments 
we did not try to disambiguate between singu- 
? lar and plural proper names and we also did 
not count as an error the adjectival reading of 
words which are always written capitalized (e.g. 
American, Russian, Okinawian, etc.). The dis- 
tribution of proper names among the ambiguous 
capitalized words is shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 allows one to estimate the perfor- 
mance of the lexicon lookup strategy which we 
take as the bottom-line. First, using this strat- 
egy we would wrongly assign the ten common 
words which were not listed in the lexicon. More 
damaging is the biind assignment of the com- 
mon word category to the words listed in the 
lexicon: out of 2,012 known word-tokens 171 
actually were used as proper names. This in to- 
tal would give us 181 errors out of 2,677 tries 
- about a 6.76% misclassification error on capi- 
talized word-tokens in the ambiguous positions. 
The lexicon lookup strategy can be enhanced 
by accounting for the immediate context of the 
capitalized words in question. However, cap- 
italized words in the ambiguous positions are 
not easily disambiguated by their surrounding 
part-of-speech context as attempted by part-of- 
speech taggers. For instance, many surnames 
are at the same time nouns or plural nouns in 
English and thus in both variants can be fol- 
lowed by a past tense verb. Capitalized words 
in the phrases Sails rose ... or Feeling him- 
sell.., can easily be interpreted either way and 
only knowledge of semantics disallows the plural 
noun interpretation of Stars can read. 
Another challenge is to decide whether the 
first capitalized word belongs to the group of the 
following proper nouns or is an external modifier 
and therefore not a proper noun. For instance, 
All American Bank is a single phrase but in All 
State Police the word "All" is an external mod- 
ifier and can be safely decapitalized. One might 
argue that a part-of-speech tagger can capture 
that in the first case the word "All" modified a 
singular proper noun ("Bank") and hence is not 
grammatical as an external modifier and in the 
second case it is a grammatical external modi- 
fier since it modifies a plural proper noun ("Po- 
lice") but a simple counter-example - All Amer- 
ican Games - defeats this line of reasoning. 
The third challenge is of a more local nature 
- it reflects a capitalization convention adopted 
by the author. For instance, words which re- 
flect the occupation of a person can be used in 
an honorific mode e.g. "Chairman Mao" vs. 
161 
"ATT chairman Smith" or "Astronaut Mario 
Runko" vs. "astronaut Mario Runko". When 
such a phrase opens a sentence, looking at the 
sentence only, even a human classifier has trou- 
bles in making a decision. 
To evaluate the performance of part-of-speech 
taggers on the proper-noun identification task 
we ran an HMM trigram tagger (Mikheev, 1997) 
and the Brill tagger (Brill,.1995) on our cor- 
pus. Both taggers used the Penn Treebank tag- 
set and were trained on the Wall Street Jour- 
nal corpus (Marcus et al, 1993). Since for our 
task the mismatch between plural proper noun 
(NNPS) and singular proper noun (NNP) was not 
important we did not count this as an error. De- 
pending on the smoothing technique, the HMM 
tagger performed in the range of 5.3%-4.5% of 
the misclassification error on capitalized com- 
mon words in the ambiguous positions, and the 
Brill tagger showed a similar pattern when we 
varied the lexicon acquisition heuristics. 
The taggers handled the cases when a poten- 
tial adjective was followed by a verb or adverb 
( "Golden added .. ") well but they got confused 
with a potential noun followed by a verb or 
adverb ( "Butler was .." vs. "Safety was .. "), 
probably because the taggers could not distin- 
guish between concrete and mass nouns. Not 
surprisingly the taggers did not do well on po- 
tential plural nouns and gerunds - none of them 
were assigned as a proper noun. The taggers 
also could not handle the case when a poten- 
tial noun or adjective was followed by another 
capitalized word ("General Accounting Office") 
well. In general, when the taggers did not have 
strong lexical preferences, apart from several 
obvious cases they tended to assign a common 
word category to known capitalized words in the 
ambiguous positions and the performance of the 
part-of-speech tagging approach was only about 
2% superior to the simple bottom-line strategy. 
3 Our  Knowledge-Free  Method  
As we discussed above, the bad news (well, not 
really news) is that virtually any common word 
can potentially act as a proper name or part of 
a multi-word proper name. Fortunately, there 
is good news too: ambiguous things are usu- 
ally unambiguously introduced at least once in 
the text unless they are part of common knowl- 
edge presupposed to be known by the readers. 
This is an observation which can be applied to 
a broader class of tasks. For example, people 
are often referred to by their surnames (e.g. 
"Black") but usually introduced at least once 
in the text either with their first name ("John 
Black") or with their title/profession affiliation 
("Mr. Black", "President Bush") and it is only 
when their names are common knowledge that 
they don't need an introduction ( e.g. "Castro", 
"Gorbachev"). 
In the case of proper name identification we 
are not concerned with the semantic class of a 
name (e.g. whether it is a person name or loca- 
tion) but we simply want to distinguish whether 
this word in this particular occurrence acts as 
a proper name or part of a multi-word proper 
name. If we restrict our scope only to a single 
sentence, we might find that there is just not 
enough information to make a confident deci- 
sion. For instance, Riders in the sentence "Rid- 
ers said later.." is equally likely to be a proper 
noun, a plural proper noun or a plural com- 
mon noun but if in the same text we find "John 
Riders" this sharply increases the proper noun 
interpretation and conversely if we find "many 
riders" this suggests the plural noun interpre- 
tation. Thus our suggestion is to look at the 
unambiguous usage of the words in question in 
the entire document. 
3.1 The  Sequence  St ra tegy  
Our first strategy for the disambiguation of cap- 
italized words in ambiguous positions is to ex- 
plore sequences of proper nouns in unambigu- 
ous positions. We call it the Sequence Strategy. 
The rationale behind this is that if we detect a 
phrase of two or more capitalized words and this 
phrase starts from an unambiguous position we 
can be reasonably confident hat even when the 
same phrase starts from an unreliable position 
all its words still have to be grouped together 
and hence are proper nouns. Moreover, this ap- 
plies not just to the exact replication of  such a 
phrase but to any partial ordering of its words of 
size two or more preserving their sequence. For 
instance, if we detect a phrase Rocket Systems 
Development Co. in the middle of a sentence, 
we can mark words in the sub-phrases Rocket 
Systems, Rocket Systems Co., Rocket Co., Sys- 
terns Development, etc. as proper nouns even if 
they occur at the beginning of a sentence or in 
other ambiguous positions. A span of capital-

Table 2: Disambiguated capitalized word-tokens/types in the ambiguous positions. 
ized words can also include lower-cased words of 
length three or shorter. This allows us to cap- 
ture phrases like A ~ M, The Phantom of the 
Opera., etc. We generate partial orders from 
such phrases in a similar way but insist that ev- 
ery generated sub-phrase should start and end 
with a capitalized word. 
To make the Sequence Strategy robust to po- 
tential capitalization errors in the document we 
also use a set of negative vidence. This set is 
essentially a set of all lower-cased words of the 
document with their following words (bigrams). 
We don't attempt here to build longer sequences 
and their partial orders because we cannot in 
general restrict the scope of dependencies in
such sequences. The negative vidence is then 
used together with the positive evidence of the 
Sequence Strategy and block the proper name 
assignment when controversy is found. For in- 
stance, if in a document he system detects a 
capitalized phrase "The President" in an un- 
ambiguous position, then it will be assigned as 
a proper name even if found in ambiguous po- 
sitions in the same document. To be more pre- 
cise the method will assign the word "The" as a 
proper noun since it should be grouped together 
with the word "President" into a single proper 
name. However, if in the same document he 
system detects an alternative vidence .g. "the 
President" or "the president" - it then blocks 
such assignment as unsafe. 
The Sequence Strategy strategy is extremely 
useful when dealing with names of organizations 
since many of them are multi-word phrases com- 
posed from common words. And indeed, as is 
shown in Table 2, the precision of this strat- 
egy was 100% and the recall about 7.5%: out 
of 826 proper names in ambiguous positions, 62 
were marked and all of them were marked cor- 
rectly. If we concentrate only on difficult cases 
when proper names are at the same time com- 
mon words of English, the recall of the Sequence 
Strategy rises to 18.7%: out of 171 common 
words which acted as proper names 32 were cor- 
rectly marked. Among such words were "News" 
from "News Corp.", "Rocket" from "Rocket 
Systems Co.", "Coast" from "Coast Guard" and 
"To" from "To B. Super". 
3.2 Single Word Ass ignment 
The Sequence Strategy is accurate, but it cov- 
ers only a part of potential proper names in 
ambiguous positions and at the same time it 
does not cover cases when capitalized words do 
not act as proper names. For this purpose we 
developed another strategy which also uses in- 
formation from the entire document. We call 
this strategy Single Word Assignment,  and it 
can be summarized as follows: if we detect a 
word which in the current document is seen 
capitalized in an unambiguous position and at 
the same time it is not used lower-cased, this 
word in this particular document, even when 
163 
used capitalized in ambiguous positions, is very 
likely to stand for a proper name as well. And 
conversely, if we detect a word which in the 
current document is used only lower-cased in 
unambiguous positions, it is extremely unlikely 
that this word will act as a proper name in an 
ambiguous position and thus, such a word can 
be marked as a common word. The only consid- 
eration here should be made for high frequency 
sentence-initial words which do not normally 
act as proper names: even if such a word is 
observed in a document only as a proper name 
(usually as part of a multi-word proper name), 
it is still not safe to mark it as a proper name in 
ambiguous positions. Note, however, that these 
words can be still marked as proper names (or 
rather as parts of proper multi-word names) by 
the Sequence Strategy. To build such list of 
stop-words we ran the Sequence Strategy and 
Single Word Assignment on the Brown Corpus 
(Francis&Kucera, 1982), and reliably collected 
100 most frequent sentence-initial words. 
Table 2 shows the success of the Single Word 
Assignment strategy: it marked 511 proper 
names from which 510 were marked correctly, 
and it marked 1,273 common words from which 
1,270 were marked correctly. The only word 
which was incorrectly marked as a proper name 
was the word "Insurance" in "Insurance com- 
pany ..." because in the same document there 
was a proper phrase "China-Pacific Insurance 
Co." and no lower-cased occurrences of the 
word "insurance" were found. The three words 
incorrectly marked as common words were: 
"Defence" in "Defence officials ..", "Trade" in 
"Trade Representation ffice .." and "Satellite" 
in "Satellite Business News". Five out of ten 
words which were not listed in the lexicon ("Pre- 
tax", "Benchmark", "Liftoff', "Downloading" 
and "Standalone") were correctly marked as 
common words because they were found to ex- 
ist lower-cased in the text. In general the error 
rate of the assignment by this method was 4 out 
of 1,784 which is less than 0.02%. It is interest- 
ing to mention that when we ran Single Word 
Assignment without the stop-list, it incorrectly 
marked as proper names only three extra com- 
mon words ("For", "People" and "MORE"). 
3.3 Tak ing  Care  of  the  Rest  
After Single Word Assignment we applied a sim- 
ple strategy of marking as common words all 
unassigned words which were found in the stop- 
list of the most frequent sentence-initial words. 
This gave us no errors and covered extra 298 
common words. In fact, we could use this strat- 
egy before Single Word Assignment, since the 
words from the stop-list are not marked at that 
point anyway. Note, however, that the Sequence 
Strategy still has to be applied prior to the stop- 
list assignment. Among the words which failed 
to be assigned by either of our strategies were 
243 proper names, but only 30 of them were 
in fact ambiguous, since they were listed in the 
lexicon of common words. So at this point we 
marked as proper names all unassigned words 
which were not listed in the lexicon of common 
words. This gave us 223 correct assignments 
and 5 incorrect ones - the remaining five out of 
these ten common words which were not listed 
in the lexicon. So, in total, by the combination 
of the described methods we achieved a
precision of correct ly -ass igned __ 2363 - -  99.62% 
al l_assigned - -  2363+9-  
and  a reca l l  of  al l_assigned __ 2363+9 __ 88 .7%.  
total_ambiguous - -  2677 - -  
Now we have to decide what to do with the re- 
maining 305 words which failed to be assigned. 
Among such words there are 275 common words 
and 30 proper names, so if we simply mark all 
these words as common words we will increase 
our recall to 100% with some decrease in pre- 
cision - from 99.62% down to 98.54%. Among 
the unclassified proper names there were a few 
which could be dealt by a part-of-speech tag- 
get: "Gray, chief...", "Gray said...", "Bill Lat- 
tanzi...", "Bill Wade...", "Bill Gates...", "Burns 
, an..." and "..Golden added". Another four un- 
classified proper names were capitalized words 
which followed the "U.S." abbreviation e.g. 
"U.S. Supreme Court". This is a difficult case 
even for sentence boundary disambiguation sys- 
terns ((Mikheev, 1998), (Palmer&Hearst, 1997) 
and (Reynar&Ratnaparkhi, 1997)) which are 
built for exactly that purpose, i.e., to decide 
whether a capitalized word which follows an ab- 
breviation is attached to it or whether there is a 
sentence boundary between them. The "U.S." 
abbreviation is one of the most difficult ones 
because it can be as often seen at the end of 
a sentence as in the beginning of multi-word 
proper names. Another nine unclassified proper 
names were stable phrases like "Foreign Min- 
ister", "Prime Minister", "Congressional Re- 
publicans", "Holy Grail", etc. mentioned just 
164 
once in a document. And, finally, about seven 
or eight unclassified proper names were diffi- 
cult to account for at all e.g. "Sate-owned" 
or "Freeman Zhang". Some of the above men- 
tioned proper names could be resolved if we ac- 
cumulate multi-word proper names across sev- 
eral documents, i.e., we can use information 
from one document when we deal with another. 
This can be seen as an extension to our Se- 
quence Strategy with the only difference that 
the proper noun sequences have to be taken not 
only from the current document but from the 
cache memory and all multi-word proper names 
identified in a document are to be appended 
to that cache. When we tried this strategy on 
our test corpus we were able to correctly assign 
14 out of 30 remaining proper names which in- 
creased the system's precision on the corpus to 
99.13% with 100% recall. 
4 D iscuss ion  
In this paper we presented an approach to the 
disambiguation of capitalized common words 
when they are used in positions where capi- 
talization is expected. Such words can act as 
proper names or can be just capitalized variants 
of common words. The main feature of our ap- 
proach is that it uses a minimum of pre-built 
resources - we use only a list of common words 
of English and a list of the most frequent words 
which appear in the sentence-stating positions. 
Both of these lists were acquired without any 
human intervention. To compensate for the lack 
of pre-acquired knowledge, the system tries to 
infer disambiguation clues from the entire doc- 
ument itself. This makes our approach domain 
independent and closely targeted to each docu- 
ment. Initially our method was developed using 
the training data of the MUC-7 evaluation and 
tested on the withheld test-set as described in 
this paper. We then applied it to the Brown 
Corpus and achieved similar results with degra- 
dation of only 0.7% in precision, mostly due to 
the text zoning errors and unknown words. We 
deliberately shaped our approach so it does not 
rely on pre-compiled statistics but rather acts 
by analogy. This is because the most interest- 
ing events are inherently infrequent and, hence, 
are difficult to collect reliable statistics for, and 
at the same time pre-compiled statistics would 
be smoothed across multiple documents rather 
than targeted to a specific document. 
The main strategy of our approach is to scan 
the entire document for unambiguous usages of 
words which have to be disambiguated. The 
fact that the pre-built resources are used only 
at the latest stages of processing (Stop-List 
Assignment and Lexicon Lookup Assignment) 
ensures that the system can handle unknown 
words and disambiguate ven very implausible 
proper names. For instance, it correctly as- 
signed five out of ten unknown common words. 
Among the difficult cases resolved by the sys- 
tem were a multi-word proper name "To B. Su- 
per" where both "To" and "Super" were cor- 
rectly identified as proper nouns and a multi- 
word proper name "The Update" where "The" 
was correctly identified as part of the maga- 
zine name. Both "To" and "The" were listed 
in the stop-list and therefore were very implau- 
sible to classify as proper nouns but neverthe- 
less the system handled them correctly. In its 
generic configuration the system achieved pre- 
cision of 99.62% with recall of 88.7% and preci- 
sion 98.54% with 100% recall. When we en- 
hanced the system with a multi-word proper 
name cache memory the performance improved 
to 99.13% precision with 100% recall. This is 
a statistically significant improvement against 
the bottom-line performance which fared about 
94% precision with 100% recall. 
One of the key factors to the success in the 
proposed method is an accurate zoning of the 
documents. Since our method relies on the cap- 
italization in unambiguous positions - such po- 
sitions should be robustly identified. In the 
general case this is not too difficult but one 
should take care of titles, quoted speech and 
list entries - otherwise if treated as ordinary 
text they can provide false candidates for cap- 
italization. Our method in general is not too 
sensitive to the capitalization errors: the Se- 
quence Strategy is complimented with the neg- 
ative evidence. This together with the fact that 
it is rare when several words appear by mistake 
more than once makes this strategy robust. The 
Single Word Assignment strategy uses the stop 
list which includes the most frequent common 
words. This screens out many potential errors. 
One notable difficulty for the Single Word As- 
signment represent words which denote profes- 
sion/title affiliations. These words modifying 
165 
a person name might require capitalization - 
"Sheriff John Smith", but in the same docu- 
ment they can appear lower-cased - "the sher- 
iff". When the capitalized variant occurs only 
as sentence initial our method predicts that it 
should be decapitalized. This, however, is an 
extremely difficult case even for human index- 
ers - some writers tend to use certain profes- 
sions such as Sheriff, Governor, Astronaut, etc., 
as honorific affiliations and others tend to do 
otherwise. This is a generally difficult case for 
Single Word Assignment - when a word is used 
as a proper name and as a common word in 
the same document, and especially when one of 
these usages occurs only in an ambiguous posi- 
tion. For instance, in a document about steel 
the only occurrence of "Steel Company" hap- 
pened to start a sentence. This lead to an er- 
roneous assignment of the word "Steel" as com- 
mon noun. Another example: in a document 
about "the Acting Judge", the word "acting" 
in a sentence "Acting on behalf.." was wrongly 
classified as a proper name. 
The described approach is very easy to imple- 
ment and it does not require training or installa- 
tion of other software. The system can be used 
as it is and, by implementing the cache mem- 
ory of multi-word proper names, it can be tar- 
geted to a specific domain. The system can also 
be used as a pre-processor to a part-of-speech 
tagger or a sentence boundary disambiguation 
program which can try to apply more sophisti- 
cated methods to unresolved capitalized words 
In fact, as a by-product of its performance, 
our system disambiguated about 17% (9 out of 
60) of ambiguous entence boundaries when an 
abbreviation was followed by a capitalized word. 
Apart from collecting an extensive cache of 
multi-word proper names, another useful strat- 
egy which we are going to test in the future is 
to collect a list of common words which, at the 
beginning of a sentence, act most frequently as 
proper names and to use such a list in a simi- 
lar fashion to the list of stop-words. Such a list 
can be collected completely automatically but 
this requires a corpus or corpora much larger 
than the Brown Corpus because the relevant 
sentences are rather infrequent. We are also 
planning to investigate the sensitivity of our 
method to the document size in more detail.
