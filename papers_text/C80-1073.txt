ATNS USED AS A PROCEDURAL DIALOG MODEL 
D. Metzing, Un ivers i ty  of Bie lefeld,  
Germany 
Summary 
An at tempt has been made to use an Aug- 
mented Trans i t ion Network  IO as a 'proce- 
dural  d ia log model' .  The development  of 
such a model  appears to be important  in 
several  respects:  
- as a device to represent  and to use 
d i f ferent  d ia log schemata proposed in 
empir ica l  conversat ion  analysis;  
- as a device to represent  and to use 
models of verbal  interact ion;  
- as a device combin ing  knowledge about 
d ia log schemata and about verbal  inter-  
act ion wi th  knowledge about task-  
or iented and goa l -d i rec ted  dialogs. 
A standard ATN should be further  de- 
ve loped in order to account  for the 
verbal  interact ions of task -or iented  
dialogs. 
Int roduct ion 
4 Natura l ly  occur ing task -or iented  dia logs 
are the joint product  of the inter-  
act ions of (at least) two par t ic ipants  
who know how to cooperate ,  i. e. who 
know how to organize 
- their  socia l  in teract ions  
- their  verbal  interact ions,  and 
- their  task -or iented  interact ions.  
The amount  of such in teract ions  which 
seem to be necessary  in spec i f ic  task-  
or iented d ia logs may 
(i) depend on a number  of factors 
given in advance such as: readi-  
ness to cooperate (a), prec iseness  
of the task representat ion  (b), 
amount  of mutua l ly  shared task- 
speci f ic  knowledge (c), amount of 
knowledge about the other part i -  
c ipant  (d) and personal  factors as 
for example competence and (self-) 
conf idence (e); 
(ii) depend on procedures apt to modi-  
fy these factors (a - e) in an 
e f f i c ient  and pos i t ive  way; 
(iii) depend on procedures used for 
task resolut ion and result  ex- 
planat ion.  
Par t ic ipants  of natura l ly  occur ing task- 
or iented dia logs are able to make use 
of these factors and procedures  in a 
sk i l l fu l  and f lexible way, but such 
propert ies  are st i l l  lacking even in 
exper imenta l  d ia log systems. 
In past natura l  language process ing  
research cons iderab le  ef forts  have been 
made to process the structures under-  
ly ing sentences or texts. Procedures 
have been developed which bui ld  up 
deep structures of sentences or which 
determine macro -s t ructures  or event 
skr ipts ('frames') under ly ing  texts. In 
the next two years specia l  ef forts  wi l l  
be made to process the structures under-  
ly ing task -or iented  dialogs. 
Representat ion  of In teract iona l  
Knowledge 
In coversat ion analysis,  systemat ic  
accounts of the sequent ia l  organizat ion 
of d ia log interact ions have been de- 
veloped, e. g. for turn taking, for 
opening sequences,  for c los ing or re- 
pair  sequences 7 or for d i f ferent  types 
of task -or iented  verbal  interact ion 
as a whole  (e. g. g iv ing advice, d irec-  
tions, explanat ions)  12 But these 
accounts have only Deen of a s t ruc tura l  
type, not of a procedura l  type. A for- 
mal representat ion  has rarely been 
attempted 6 and an integrat ion or inter-  
act ion of d i f ferent  knowledge sources 
is genera l ly  not considered.

In the subsequent  sect ions we wi l l  argue 
for a level  of representat ion  gu id ing  
the soc ia l  in teract iona l  and the verbal  
in teract iona l  aspects  of task -or iented  
d ia logs .  A personal  be l ie f  or knowledge 
component  wi l l  use in format ion  of this 
i n te ract iona l  level together  wi th infor-  
mat ion of a task level as wel l  as infor-  
mat ion of a sentence/ text  level. We wi l l  
argue for a procedura l  representat ion  of 
in teract iona l  knowledge and we think 
that the usefu lness  of ATNS I0'3 for such 
a representat ion  should be examined in 
more detail .  
'Parsing Interact ions '  
The approach presented here di f fers  from 
other  computat iona l  d ia log models  in the 
fo l lowing way: 
- A d ia log model  is not based on an un- 
2 der ly ing  d ia log prototype spec i fy ing  
essent ia l l y  task -or iented  informat ion.  
It is c la imed that the social  inter-  
act ional  and the verbal  in teract iona l  
aspects of task -or iented  dia logs are 
important  enough to be represented  in 
a deta i led  way on a specia l  level. 
- Dia log proport ies  are not only exa- 
mined by prob lem so lv ing techniques I. 
Instead, extended pars ing  techniques 
are used in 'parsing interact ions '  and 
they are supposed to be he lpfu l  in de- 
termin ing the in teract iona l  s t ructure 
under ly ing  utterances.  
Let us further speci fy  the k ind of inter-  
act ional  knowledge which  par t i c ipants  of 
certa in types of task -or iented  d ia logs 
are supposed to have as wel l  as ways to 
represent  it. The par t ic ipants  wi l l  
genera l ly  know how to manage the social,  
the verbal  and the task -or iented  inter-  
actions. They wi l l  genera l ly  know about 
several  rather  invariant, components  of 
a certa in type of task -or iented  d ia logs 
as wel l  as of a normal  sequence of these 
components.  They know about the deta i led  
(alternative) st ructures of each compo- 
nent, the choice of which may depend on 
factors as were ment ioned  above(a - e). 
They know 
- how to in i t iate  a social  contact /a  ver- 
bal in teract ion  and how to respond 
pos i t i ve ly /negat ive ly  to this in i t ia-  
tive; 
- how to cont inue/ to  mainta in  an inter-  
action, 
- how to s ignal ize  interest,  competence 
or d i f f i cu l t ies  of) understand ing ,  
- how to organ ize  turn- tak ing,  
- how to in i t iate the te rminat ion  of a 
social  contact /a  verbal  in teract ion  
and how to respond pos i t i ve ly  or nega- 
t ively to it. 
Part  of this knowledge may be descr ibed 
as sequences of soc ia l /verba l  inter-  
act ions, formal ly  to be represented  as 
connected (sub-) networks  of an ATN. 
I. e. soc ia l /verba l  in teract ion  is seen 
as a process of path se lect ion of (at 
least) two par t i c ipants  in a network  of 
states and state t rans i t ions.  These 
(sub-) networks  should be set up on an 
empir ica l  bas is  ( recordings of natura l ly  
occur ing  task -or iented  dialogs).  
An Example 
Some propert ies  of the in teract iona l  
knowledge ment ioned  above may be repre- 
sented in an ATN in a s t ra ight fo rward  
way, whereas  the representat ion  of  
others seem less s t ra ight forward.  
Const i tuents  
Let us assume that some types of infor-  
mat ion -g iv ing  dia logs may be ass igned a 
-488 
network  st ructure w i th  the fo l lowing

action:

Each (sub-)network represents  sequences 
of in teract ion  
- on the level of a d ia log type (a), 
- on the level of  speech act sequences 
(b), or  
- on the level  of tu rn - tak ing  organi -  
zat ion (c). 
The arcs indicate (alternative) state 
t rans i t ions / (a l te rnat ive)  courses of 
interact ion.  They may be marked or un- 
marked  ('JUMPs'). 
Accord ing  to fig. I a d ia log interact ion  
may start: 
- w i th  a contact  in i t ia t ing  ut terance 
( "EXCUSE ME ..."), level a; 
- w i th  a quest ion  in t roducer  ("MAY I 
ASK YOU ...") level b; 
- wi th  a task -spec i f i c  quest ion  ("WHERE 
DO I F IND ..."), level b; 
- w i th  a 'turn introducer '  ("YES"I "...") , 
level c. 
Poss ib le  act ions may be sk ipped 
(cf--~4--~arrow), repeated ( loons; i tera-  
tion) or some sequences nay ~e embedded 
into other  sequences (cf. QUESTION/  
ANSWER arc in the QUEST ION/ANSWER sub- 
network; recurs ion) .  
These subnetworks  are connected  to other  
networks  w i th  the same type of  infor-  
mat ion or wi th other  types of in for -  
mation: 
linguistic in format ion  in order  to re- 
cogn ize /generate  d i f ferent  forms (e. g. 
to in i t iate  a contact,  to int roduce 
quest ions,  topass  turns) or d i rect /  
ind i rect  ways to ask a quest ion  ("9~ERE 
DO I F IND ..." vs "I DO NOT KNOW ...", 
"I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW ..."); task-oriented 
in format ion  in order  to bu i ld  up coherent  
sets of answers (on the basis  of a 
task-model) .  
Note that some ut terances  may serve 
- -489- -  
several  in teract iona l  roles ("MAY I 
ASK YOU ..." ut tered at the beg inn ing  
of a d ia log in i t iates a contact  and 
in t roduces a quest ion.)  Specia l  tests 
on arcs wi l l  recognize this and the 
cor respond ing  act ions wi l l  bu i ld  up an 
in teract iona l  s t ructure accord ing to such 
mul t ip le  roles of const i tuents .  (A way 
to see them from d i f ferent  perspect ives. )  
In terpretat ion  of Arcs 
The in teract iona? in format ion  represented  
in an ATN-subnet  may be used to plan and 
to guide the recogn i t ion /generat ion  of 
soc ia l /verba l  in teract ion  as part of a 
task -or iented  dialog. The in format ion  
represented  on an arc should be used for 
both, for recogn i t ion  as wel l  as for 
p lann ing /generat ion .  The st ructure of the 
(sub-)networks is usefu l  in the sense 
that 'normal' courses of in teract ion  are 
exp l i c i ty  represented.  So they are 
expected  and ind icate  a k ind of inter-  
act ional  coherence of a task -or iented  
dialog. But speakers may v io late  such 
normal ly  respected d ia log sequences and 
they can cope with this fact. It is 
there fore  des i rab le  to make a more 
f lexib le use of the in format ion  represen-  
ted in a network.  E. g. it seems des i rab le  
to ca lcu late  a (not yet exist ing) tran-  
s i t ion on the basis  of task -spec i f i c  
cues and/or  ut terance cues (for example 
when a par t i c ipant  reopens an a l ready 
c losed subtask or when he repeats or 
reopens an a l ready executed  move or 
when he suddenly  terminates  an inter-  
action. 
Fur ther  deve lopments  
It seems des i rab le  to have an extended 
ATN parser  in order  to cope with unex- 
pected d ia log sequences.  In implement ing  
aspects of soc ia l /verba l  in teract ions  
one should examine carefu l ly  ef forts 
made 
5,9 - to use an ATN in a more f lexib le way 
- to combine recogn i t ion  and generat ion 
in an ATN 8, and 
- to bui ld  up several  in teract ing  ATNs".
