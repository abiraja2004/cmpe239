Abstract 
This paper describes standardizing discourse 
annotation schemes for Japanese and eval- 
uates the reliability of these schemes. We 
propose three schemes, that is, utterance 
unit, discourse segment and discourse mark- 
ers. These schemes have shown to be in- 
crementally improved based on the experi- 
mental results, and the reliability of these 
schemes are estimated as "good" range. 
1 Introduction 
Linguistic corpora are now indispensable 
of speech and language research communi- 
ties. They are used not only for examin- 
ing their characteristics, but also for (semi- 
)automatically learning rules for speech 
recognition, parsing and anaphora resolu- 
tion, and evaluating the performance of 
speech and natural anguage processing sys- 
tems. 
Linguistic orpora can be used as they are, 
however, they are usually annotated with in- 
formation such as part of speech and syn- 
tactic structures. Currently there are many 
large linguistic annotated corpora world- 
wide, but the types of annotation informa- 
tion are limited to morphological nd syntac- 
- tic information. While there are some cor- 
pora annotated with discourse information 
like speech act types and discourse struc- 
tures, they are much smaller than that of 
the corpora, with morphological and syn- 
tactic information. One of the major rea- 
sons for this difference in the size is due 
to the lack of computer tools such as mor- 
phological analyzers and syntactic parsers 
to semi-automatically annotate information. 
Of course we will be able to develop such 
tools for discourse information, but before 
that, we must create a base corpora by set- 
ting standards 1 for resource sharing, which 
can contribute to creating large resources for 
discourse. 
To this end, the Discourse Research Ini- 
tiative (DRI) was set up in March of 1996 
byUS, European, and Japanese researchers 
to develop standard discourse annotation 
schemes (Walker et al, 1996). In line with 
the effort of this initiative, a discourse tag- 
ging working group has started in Japan in 
May 1996, with the support of the Japanese 
Society of Artificial Intelligence. The work- 
ing group consists of representatives from 
eight universities and four research institutes 
in Japan. In the first year, (1) we collected 
and analyzed existing annotation schemes 
for Japanese discourse from the viewpoints 
of annotation units and information types, 
(2) developed new annotation schemes and 
experimentally annotated actual data, and 
(3) analyzed the experimental results to ira- 
1 The efforts have been called 'standardization', 
but we must admit this naming is misleading at 
least. In typical standardizing efforts, as done 
in audio-visual nd telecommunication technologies, 
companies try to expand the market for their prod- 
ucts by making their products or interfaces stan- 
dards, and this profit directedness leaves room for 
negotiation. Even if the negotiation fails, they can 
appeal their products or interfaces for the market 
to judge. The objective of standardizing efforts in 
discourse is to promote interactions among different 
discourse researcher groups and thereby provide a 
solid foundation for corpus-based discourse r search, 
which makes the researchers dispense with duplicate 
resource making efforts and increases the resources 
to be shared.

prove the coding schemes. In the second 
year, based on the examination results ob- 
tained in the first year's experiments, we 
have revised new annotation schemes and 
conducted the second round of coding ex- 
periments to verify them. 
This paper describes our project of stan- 
dardizing annotation schemes for Japanese 
discourse. In the following, annotation 
schemes for utterance units, discourse struc- 
ture, and discourse markers are discussed 
based on our coding experiments. 
2 Utterance Unit 
2.1 First annotat ion scheme 
Based on the survey of existing annota- 
tion schemes uch as the schemes of sev- 
eral research groups in Japan (Kyoto Univ., 
Tsukuba Univ., Waseda Univ., ATR (Na- 
gata, 1992)) and DRI (Allen and Core, 1996; 
Carletta et al, 1997a) for utterances (we 
call this utterance unit tags), we created 
the first annotation manual for illocutionary 
force type, mood information and exchange 
structures. Illocutionary force types come 
from speech act theory (Searle, 1969), and 
are one of the most popular set of describ- 
ing communicative aspects of utterances. 
Mood information corresponds to the mean- 
ing of auxiliary verbs in Japanese, which has 
been hinted that there might be close rela- 
tions with illocutionary act types? Exchange 
structures define minimal interactional units 
consisting of initiative, response and follow- 
up (Coulthhard, 1992; Stenstrom, 1994). 
We carried out a first annotation exper- 
iments using the above three manuals, and 
obtained the following lessons for improving 
the schemes. 
? The frequencies of the classifications: 
There exist exceedingly high and low 
frequency classifications in the illocu- 
tionary force types and mood informa- 
tion. The most frequent classification is 
inform in the illocutionary force types 
(54.9 %). 
? The disagreement among coders: 
The disagreement among coders oc- 
curred due to three factors. The first 
is consistent decision errors caused by 
different interpretations of the category 
names (some coders classify utterances 
based on their interpretations of the cat- 
egory names, not on the functional defi- 
nitions of the categories). The second 
is by the ambiguity of certain words 
and/or expressions. The last involves 
incomplete utterances like omission of 
the end part of utterances observed in 
Japanese spontaneous speech. 
The correlation between the informa- 
tion types: 
Most of the classifications for illocu- 
tionary force types and mood informa- 
tion show high correlation. This holds 
for exchange structure and speech act / 
? mood except for inform category in the 
illocutionary force types. 
2.2 Second annotat ion  scheme 
Based on the analysis of the experimental re- 
sults, we revised the first annotation scheme 
by (1) unifying mood information into illo- 
cutionary force types, and (2) re-classifying 
some categories, i.e., further classifying high 
fi-equency categories by other information 
type and collapsing low frequency categories. 
The resultant scheme is composed of the il- 
locutionary force types and the role of the 
utterances in the interaction unit. 
To improve the disagreement among 
coders, we impose the constraint on the pat- 
terns of exchange structure (Figure 1). 
In this new scheme, the tags (Figure 2) 
need to be an element of exchange structure 
except for those of dialogue management. 
As in (Carletta et al, 1997a; Carletta et 
al., 1997b), we also created a decision tree to 
improve the coding reliability of this scheme. 
This decision tree consists of a set of ques- 
tions concerning the functional character of 
target utterances. 
2.3 Analysis of annotat ion  results 
In order to examine the reliability of this 
new scheme, we have carried out another

tagging experiment for comparing the relia- 
bility of the first and the second scheme. We 
used five different ypes of task-oriented dia- 
logues (Japanese Map Task, group schedul- 
ing, route direction, telephone shopping and 
appointment scheduling). An annotation 
unit is pre-defined based on (Meteer and 
Taylor, 1995), which roughly corresponds to 
one verb and related case phrases. 
The experimental results show major im- 
provements on the frequency of the cate- 
gories (by avoiding the categories of high and 
low frequencies), and the reliability of the 
scheme. 
? Frequency: 
The average quantity of information 
(entropy) are 1.65 in the first scheme, 
and 3.50 in the new scheme. The most 
frequent category in the new scheme is 
Understand (15.5 %), and other ca.te- 
gories are evenly distributed. 
? Reliability: 
The agreement among the coders is 
quantitatively evaluated with reliabil- 
ity in terms of the kappa coefficient K 
(Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta et 
- al., 1997b). In raw data, we cannot ob- 
serve improvement, however, we found 
out a number of disagreements caused 
by consistent mistakes about the word 
"hai", which can be interpreted as ei- 
ther a positive response or a follow-up. 
Some coders neglected the constraints 
on follow-up introduced by the new 
manuM: the constraint says that follow- 
ups must come only after response class 
utterances. This mistake can be alle- 
viated by making a computer tagging 
tool display a warning message to the 
coders if they do not observe the con- 
straint. To correctly evaluate the relia- 
bility of the schemes, the above simple 
problem should be discounted. Table 1 
shows the agreement rate after substi- 
tuting the mistaken follow-ups with the 
responses, in which we can clearly ob- 
serve improvement on the reliability of 
the new scheme over the that of the first. 
The reliability score of the new scheme is 
K = 0.64. This score is in "good" range ac- 
cording to (Siegel and Castellan, 1988), but 
does not seem to be the best. One reason for 
this is that our experiments were done with 
untrained subjects, which means that there 
can be more room for improvements on the 
reliability.

3 D iscourse  S t ruc ture  
3.1 First annotat ion scheme 
Grosz and Sidner proposed a model of dis- 
course structure, in which discourse struc- 
ture is composed of the linguistic structure, 
the intentional structure, and the attentional 
state (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). We built the 
first annotation scheme of discourse struc- 
ture in dialogue based on this model. The 
written instruction of the scheme describes 
as follows. 
? Utterances both at the start and the end 
of segments are marked. 
? Discourse segments may be nested. 
That is, a discourse segment can con- 
tain some smaller segments. 
? Coders are allowed to decide the size of 
discourse segments. 
In the first coding experiments, disagree- 
ments among the coders are incurred by 
three types of difficulties in segmenting di- 
alogue. 
? Identification of the end of discourse 
segments: 
This case often occurs due to the ut- 
terances which can be interpreted as 
responding to the preceding utterance 
while can be interpreted as initiating a 
"new (but often related) topic, and the 
utterances followed by long series of re- 
sponses, which are difficult to judge to 
be as initiating or responding. 
? Disagreements of the nesting level of 
discourse segments: 
There are cases where coders can judge 
the relationship between adjacent dis- 
course segments differently such as co- 
ordination and subordination. This re- 
sults in different discourse structures, 
although the coders identically recog- 
nized the start and the end of the seg- 
ment at the top level. 
? Annotation units: 
Coders are allowed to change annota- 
tion units if necessary. Hence, for exam- 
ple, if some coder combine utterances in
the given transcription, she ,night delete 
boundaries for segmenting discourse. 
3.2 Second annotat ion  scheme 
We renewed the annotation scheme based on 
the analysis of disagreements in the first cod- 
ing experiments. 
In the second annotation scheme, the 
coders identify topic breaks between ut- 
terances based on the exchange structure, 
29 
32 A: 'Chikatetsu wa doko made noreba 
iidesu ka?' \[I\] 
(What station should I take the 
subway to?) 
33 B: 'Hommachi eki kara Chuou eki 
made nori masu.' \[R\] 
(From Hommachi station to Chuou 
station.) 
34 A: 'Hai.' IF\] 
(Yes.) 
35 B: 'Ikura kakari masu ka?' \[I\] 
(How much does it cost?) 
36 A: 'Kuukou kara desu ka?' \[R&I\] 
(From the airport?) 
37 B: 'Chikatetsu no hou dake wa. ~ 
\[aaI\] 
(How much only concerning the 
subway?) 
38 A: 'Hommachi eki kava Chuou eki 
made 210 en desu.' \[R\] 
(210 yen from Hommachi station to 
Chuou station.) 
38 B: 'Hai.' \[F\] 
(Yes.) 
Figure 3: Exchanges in a Japanese dialogue. 
which is explained in section 2. The topic 
break always starts a discourse segment. 
This modification can avoid the problem of 
identifying the segment ends. This scheme 
uses an exchange as a building block of 
discourse segments. Topic boundaries are 
marked before the Initiate and the Response- 
with-Initiate utterances, which start a new 
discourse segment. The Response and 
Follow-up utterances do not start a dis- 
course segment. Figure 3 shows exchange 
structures with the utterance unit tags in 
a Japanese dialogue. In this Figure, \[I\], 
\[R\], \[l~I\], IF l denotes Initiate, Response, 
Response-with-Initiate, ndFollow-up utter- 
ance, respectively. The topic boundaries are 
inserted before the utterances 32, 35, 36, and 
37, in this example. 
The second scheme is not concerned with 
the nesting structure of the discourse seg- 
ments. This identification of topic breaks 
results in a flat structure of the discourse 
segments. Instead, each topic break is an- 
notated in terms of two level topic-break- 
index(TBI), which indicates dissimilarity of 
the topics. The boundaries of the discourse 
segment with TBI=I and =2 indicate aweak 
and a strong break of topic, respectively. 
The tagging procedure of the second 
scheme is 
1. recognizing exchange structures, 
2. making tags immediately before all ini- 
tiating utterances, and 
3. assigning the strength of topic break for 
the tags. 
3.3 Analysis of annotation results 
We carried out tagging experiments for dia- 
logues of two tasks, scheduling and route di- 
rection, based on two versions of annotation 
schemes. The agreement of tags between the 
coders is quantitatively evaluated with K. 
Table 2 summarizes the average scores of 
reliability for paired comparisons among all 
coders. The number of coders is 4 and 5 for 
the route direction and the scheduling of the 
first experiments, respectively, and 10 for the 
second experiments. Table 2(a) shows re- 
liability of existence of boundaries between 
all discourse segments ignoring the nesting 
structure and the strength of topic break. 
Table 2(b) shows reliability of structure of 
the discourse structure. The latter compar- 
ison considers the nesting level for the first 
annotation scheme and the TBI for the sec- 
ond annotation scheme. The second anno- 
tation scheme are confirmed to improve the 
reliability, especially for the segment struc- 
ture. It successfully restricts the coder to 
mark start of the discourse segments using 
an exchange as a building block of the dis- 
course segments. In the first experiment, re- 
liability of segment structure was incurred by 
the difference of nesting structure the depth 
of which the coder determine& Replacing

4 Discourse  Markers  
In English, some discourse markers have 
shown to be a cue to predict he boundary of 
discourse segments. In Japanese, discourse 
markers are expressed with the same vo- 
cabulary with aiduti (acknowledgment) and 
fillers. 
Unlike English discourse markers, 
Japanese discourse markers are not lexi- 
cal. Japanese words as "etto', "ano" and 
"ja" have no meaning themselves. How- 
ever, there are abundant in Japanese dis- 
course. Kawamori compared English dis- 
couse markders with Japanese. In Japanese 
coupus, half of the turns are started with 
these words, while English corpus shows that 
about 25 % of the turns start with corre- 
sponding expression(Kawamori et al, 1998). 
The correlation between Japanese dis- 
course markers and the boundary of dis- 
course segments has not shown, which can 
be used to improve the identification of the 
discourse boundaries. In this section, the ex- 
pressions which can be used for discourse 
markers, aiduti and fillers are enumerated 
based on the data survey, and the correlation

4.1 Surface expressions of discourse 
markers 
Discourse markers and speech related phe- 
nomena re defined as utterances that func- 
tion as a lubricant rather than contributing 
to achieving some task-related goals in con- 
versations. In the first coding experiments, 
coders are instructed to annotate 'aiduti' 
(acknowledgments) and discourse markers 
based on their functional descriptions. Here 
filler was tentatively included in discourse 
markers. 
Table 3 and Table 4 show words which 
were selected by 4 coders and their agree- 
ments of the selection. 
The results how that surface forms can be 
Used to distinguish between discourse mark- 
ers and aiduti (and fillers), and the variety 
of the forms is rather limited. Based on the 
31 
analysis of the results, we defined the func- 
tions and surface forms of aiduti, discourse 
markers and fillers as follows. 
4.1.1 Aidut i  
? Definition: 
Items which signify hearing of the 
other's peaking or prompting the next 
utterance (their function is not a defi- 
nite answer ather a lubricant for con- 
versations). 
? Surface forms: 
"hai (yes, yeah, right)", "eto (well, aah, 
urn)", "e (mnun, yeah)" 
English corresponding expressions are 
shown in bracket for reference. 
The above three expressions covered most 
of the cases for aiduti n the test-tagging ex- 
periment (for example, "hai" covered 81% 
of all aiduti expressions), although we found 
out that there are a few expression different 
from the above. Candidate words sometimes 
have other functions than aiduti. 
If "hai" functions as a definite answer, 
coders are instructed not to annotate it as 
aiduti. 
4.1.2 Discourse markers 
? Definition: 
Items which mainly contribute to clar- 
ifying discourse structure but not to 
problem solving 
? Surface forms: 
"ja (ok)", "dewa (then, ok)", "sore- 
dewa (then, ok)", "soushitara (then, in 
that case)", "deshitara (then, in that 
case)", "souieba (I've just remembered, 
aah", "de (you see, so)", "sorede (and 
so)", "sousuruto (and so, in that case)", 
"soushimasuto (so you mean, in that 
case)", "tsumari (I mean, that means 
that)", "yousuruni (so you mean,)", 
"mazu (first, firstly)", "saishoni (first, 
firstly)", "kondo (then, next)", "tsugini 
(then, next)", "saigoni (last, lastly)", 
"ma~ (well)" 
The phrases uch as "hanashi wa kawari- 
masuga (by the way)" and "tsugi ni ikimasu

markers, which are not identified by surface 
forms, but by their functions. 
4.1.3 Fi l ler 
? Definition: 
Items that fill up the gap between ut- 
terances and indicate the speaker's state 
"like under consideration, hesitation and 
continuation. 
? Candidate words: 
"eto (well, aah, urn)", "e (nnnm, 
yeah)", "ano (well, aa.h, urn)", % (oh)", 
"n (mmm)", "to (well)" 
To limit candidate words, we suppose dif- 
ferences between corders decrease. We can 
annotate these words almost automatically. 
4.2 Corre lat ion between discourse 
markers  and discourse 
boundar ies  
We examined the correlation between the 
discourse markers and the discourse bound- 
ary defined in section 3. In this experi- 
ment, 5 subjects were instructed to annotate 
the discourse boundaries, and 46 discourse 
markers were automatically selected by their 
surface forms in 5 dialogue data. 
Table 5 shows that 64 % (41% for segment 
level 1 and 23 % for segment level 2) of dis- 
course markers are located directly after the 
discourse boundaries. The chance level is 30 
%, and therefore, surface forms of discourse 
markers were found to be effective cue for 
recognizing discourse boundaries.

5 ~ Conc lus ion  
This paper summarized our efforts on stan- 
dardizing discourse annotation schemes for 
Japanese and evaluated the reliability of the 
schemes. To improve the base reliability of 
the schemes, (1) interactional units are use- 
ful for constraining tag candidates and link- 
ing the utterance to the discourse structure 
level, and (2) discourse markers identified by 
their surface form can be used as a cue for 
indicating discourse boundaries. 
The reliability issues involve various fac- 
tors. For example, in the projects which 
attain high agreement rate of tagging such 
as the MapTask and Switchboard, they used 
syntactic ues in the coding manuals. This 
apparently contribute to the high agreement 
rate of tagging, although there leave some 
possibilities for confusing syntactic informa- 
tion with the meaning of the tags. In addi- 
tion, in the MapTask, they include domain 
specific knowledge in the tags. The Switch- 
board project took the approach that the 
coders are allowed to tag utterances freely 
and then create the abstract classification 
relating to DAMSL coding schemes based 
on the first tagging experiment. Interest- 
ingly, the coders in the above two projects 
are all students, not researchers as in DRI 
and our project. The student coders are 
well-trained, while researchers of DRI and 
our project sometime have some biases to 
the coding schemes and often take little time 
for tagging experiments. The MapTask used 
the decision tree approach and was success- 
ful for attaining the high agreement rate. 
Since then, the decision tree approach has 
been believed to be a key to the high agree- 
ment rate. DRI and our project also adopted 
this approach, but the resultant agreement 
rate is not so high, comparing to the Map- 
Task project. Considering various factoring 
involving the reliability, we should realise the 
decision tree approach cannot be a only key 
to the successful coding schemes. In this re- 
spect, our experiments are interesting. That 
is, we showed there is some room for improv- 
ing coding schemes by introducing different 
dimensions to the original coding schemes. 
This kind of continuous efforts to improving 
coding schemes hould not be looked over. 
The computer tagging tools are necessary 
at least for creating consistent underlying 
representation f the tagging results. More- 
over, for multi-level tagging, as in MATE 
and our project, the tools should provide 
easy access to different level. In both re- 
spects, the MATE tagging tool currently 
developed will be a very valuable resource 
for discourse (tagging) research community. 
However, if we want to create a large dis- 
cursive annotated corpora, we must consider 
to build semi-automatically tagging tools 
used in morphological nd syntactic tagging, 
which should include some kind of machine 
learning techniques.
