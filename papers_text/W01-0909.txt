Abstract
Many Natural Language Processing ap-
plications require semantic knowledge
about topics in order to be possible or to
be efficient. So we developed a system,
SEGAPSITH, that acquires it automat-
ically from text segments by using an
unsupervised and incremental cluster-
ing method. In such an approach, an
important problem consists of the vali-
dation of the learned classes. To do that,
we applied another clustering method,
that only needs to know the number
of classes to build, on the same sub-
set of text segments and we reformu-
late our evaluation problem in compar-
ing the two classifications. So, we es-
tablished different criteria to compare
them, based either on the words as class
descriptors or on the thematic units.
Our first results lead to show a great
correlation between the two classifica-
tions.
1 Introduction
Among all the applications in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), many require semantic knowl-
edge about topics in order to be possible or to
be efficient. These applications are, for exam-
ple, topic segmentation and identification or text
classification. As this kind of knowledge is not
easy to build manually, we developed a system,
SEGAPSITH (Ferret and Grau, 1998a), (Fer-
ret and Grau, 1998b), to acquire it automatically.
In this field, there are two classes of approaches.
Supervised learning that requires to know a pri-
ori which topics have to be learned and to pos-
sess a tagged corpus as a learning set. It is the
approach generally adopted by the different sys-
tems, as those participating to TREC or TDT.
However, we wanted to design a system allow-
ing us to work in open domain, without any re-
striction about the subjects to be represented and,
thus, to be recognized in texts. SEGAPSITH
is grounded on an unsupervised and incremental
learning based on a conceptual clustering method.
After a thematic segmentation of the texts that
divides a text in segments made of lemmatized
words, i. e. thematic units, the system aggregates
similar enough thematic units. Aggregation con-
sists of regrouping all the words of the different
similar units and associating to them a weight ac-
cording to their occurrence number. This weight
represents the importance of a word relative to the
described topic. The incremental aspect allows us
to augment topic knowledge by treating succes-
sive corpora without reconsidering the knowledge
already existing.
In such an approach, an important problem
consists of the validation of the learned classes.
As we do not possess an existing classifica-
tion that agrees with the granularity level of our
classes, we decided to accomplish this evaluation
by using a second classification method on the
same data and by comparing their results. This
second method is an entropy-based method, and
requires to know the number of classes to form.
So, if both results are similar enough, although
the methods applied are different, we could con-
clude that the learned classes are quite relevant
and that the two methods are efficient.
After applying the second method, we pos-
sess two sets composed by the same number of
classes. Each class regroups thematic units and
is described by a set of words. So, we established
different criteria to compare them, based either on
the words as class descriptors or on the thematic
units they gather. After the presentation of the
two methods, we shall present our tests and the
first results we obtained.
2 Semantic domain learning
This description aims at showing the data used for
learning, and the specificity of the learned classes.
2.1 The thematic segmentation:
SEGCOHLEX
Studied texts are newspaper articles coming from
two corpora: ?Le Monde? and ?AFP?. Some of
these texts have been used to build a lexical net-
work where links between two words represent an
evaluation of their mutual information to capture
semantic and pragmatic relations between them,
computed from their co-occurrence count. In or-
der to build class of words linked to a same topic,
we first realize a topic segmentation of the texts
in thematic units (TU) whose words refer to the
same topic, and learning is applied on these the-
matic units.
Text segmentation is based on the use of the
collocation network. A topic is detected by com-
puting a cohesion value for each word resulting
from the relations found in the network between
these words and their neighbors in a text. As in
Kozima?s work (Kozima, 1993), this computa-
tion operates on words belonging to a focus win-
dow that is moved all over the text.The cohe-
sion values lead to build a graph and by succes-
sive transformations applied to it, texts are auto-
matically divided in discourse segments. Such a
method leads to delimit small segments, whose
size is equivalent to a paragraph, i. e. capa-
ble of retrieving topic variations in short texts,
as newswires for example. Table 1 shows an ex-
tract of the words belonging to a cohesive seg-
ment about a dedication of a book.
2.2 Semantic Domain learning in
SEGAPSITH
Learning a semantic domain consists of aggre-
gating all the most cohesive thematic units, TUs,
that are related to a same subject, i. e. a same
kind of situation. We only retain segments whose
cohesion value is higher than a threshold, in or-
der to ground our learning on the more reliable
units. Similarity between a thematic unit and
a semantic domain is evaluated from their com-
mon words. When the similarity value exceeds a
threshold, the thematic unit is aggregated to the
semantic domain, otherwise a new domain is cre-
ated. Each aggregation of a new thematic unit in-
creases the system?s knowledge about one topic
by reinforcing recurrent words and adding new
ones. Weights on words represent their impor-
tance relative to the topic and are computed from
the number of occurrences of these words in the
TUs.
Units related to a same topic are found in dif-
ferent texts and often develop different points of
view of a same type of subject. To ensure a better
similarity between them, SEGAPSITH enriches
a particular description given by a text segment
by adding to these units those words of the collo-
cation network that are particularly linked to the
words found in the segment. Table 2 gives an ex-
tract of the words added to the segment of Table
1.
This method leads SEGAPSITH to learn spe-
cific topic representations (see Table 3) as op-
posed to (Lin, 1997) for example, whose method
builds general topic descriptions as for economy,
sport, etc. Moreover, it does not depend on any a
priori classification of the texts.
We applied the learning module of SEGAP-
SITH on one month (May 1994) of AFP
newswires, corresponding to 7823 TUs. In our
experiments (Ferret and Grau, 1998a), (Ferret
and Grau, 1998b), we showed that domains reach
a stability at 15 to 20 aggregations, and that words
having a weight below 0.1 are rarely related to the
domain. Thus, we only selected domains result-
ing from at least 15 aggregations for our cross-
comparison, i.e. 71 domains regrouping 4935
TUs and 4380 words having a weight upon 0.1.
A lot of domains share common words, and are
close enough to be considered as different repre-
sentations of specific points of view of a general
topic, as economy, sport, etc.

overlapping clusters according to the word dis-
tributions in the units. It is realized with an al-
gorithm which looks like K-means (here K=71).
Each cluster is the merge of several thematic units
and is represented by its centroid. We search
for the partition which minimizes the Kullback-
Leibleir divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991)
between the word distributions of the thematic
units and those of of their centroids. This entropy-
based measure is convex (Jardino, 2000), this pro-
priety permits to get an optimal partition whatever
the initial conditions.
3.1 Entropy
We assume that each thematic unit is represented
by one quantitative vector whose components are
the relative occurrences of a selection of words re-
lated to the unit. The advantages of this normal-
ization is that the representation of the thematic
units does not depend on the length of the units
and can be modelized in the frame of the infor-
mation theory (Cover and Thomas, 1991).
Assuming that O
w;tu
is the occurrence of the
word labelled w in the thematic unit labelled tu
and that O
tu
is the occurrence of all the words in
the thematic unit tu, such that O
tu
=
P
w
O
w;tu
,
each thematic unit vector component , p(w=tu),
is :
p(w=tu) =
O
w;tu
O
tu
(1)
When the thematic units are unclassed, their
entropy is given by (Cover and Thomas, 1991):
H
TU
=  
X
w;tu
p(w; tu)  ln[p(wjtu)] (2)
with p(w; tu) = Ow;tuP
w;tu
O

When the thematic units are gathered in K clus-
ters, labelled k, the cluster entropy is, H
K
:
H

=  
X
w;k
p(w; k)  ln[p(wjk)] (3)
where p(wjk) is defined as :
p(wjtu 2 k) = p(wjk) =

The cluster entropy is always higher than or
equal to the unit entropy (log-sum rule (Cover and
Thomas, 1991)), so that the Kullback-Leibleir di-
vergence defined as:
D

(5)
is always higher than or equal to 0.
3.2 Clustering algorithm
Minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
amounts to minimize the entropy H
K
because
H
TU
does not depend on the clusters.
The number of possible partitions is huge,
roughly 493571. We have observed that a random
search is faster than a systematic one (Jardino,
2000), and we have used this paradigm to build
the algorithm described below:
1- Define a priori, K, the cluster number, here
K=71.
2- Initialize: put all the thematic units in one clus-
ter, calculate the entropy H
K
(equation 3). The
remaining K-1 clusters are empty.
3- Do the random selection of one thematic unit
and of another cluster for this unit.
4- Move the unit from its former cluster to the new
randomly selected one, calculate the new entropy.
5- If the new entropy is lower, leave the unit in its
new cluster, otherwise move it back to its initial
cluster.
6- Repeat 3 to 5 until there is no more change.
The optimal clustering of the 4935 thematic
units in 71 clusters is performed on a workstation
(SGI Indy) within twenty minutes.
4 Comparing two classifications
We established different criteria for comparing
the two classifications, based on the elements
used to describe the classes. First, each class is a
set of words with an occurrence number for each
of them; second it is also a set of thematic units.
So, the comparison can be done along these two
points of view.
In order to evaluate the overlapping of the
classes of words, we applied each classifica-
tion method on the two classification results:
the classes of words resulting from the second
method are classified relative to the semantic do-
mains. For comparing the classes of TUs, we ap-
plied the entropy measure on one hand to measure
the overlapping of the classes, and  and Mantel
tests on the other hand to evaluate the differences
in the repartition of all the TUs.
4.1 The word point of view
4.1.1 Classification by similarity
The classification of the clusters relative to the
semantic domains exploits the same similarity
measure than the one used for the learning phase.
In a first step, some domains are selected accord-
ing to the value of the activ function:
activ(d) =
X
i
W
d;i
W
c;i
(6)
where W
d;i
is the weight of the word i in the
semantic domain d and W
c;i
is the weight of the
same word in the cluster c. This first step was
used in the learning phase because the number of
semantic domains was increasing rapidly and this
measure leads to a first fast selection of interesting
domains before evaluating an in-depth similarity.
We kept this step, even if it was not necessary,
in order to apply exactly the same method in the
evaluation phase. Afterwards, each selected do-
main can be compared to the cluster by using the
similarity measure given below. If one of these
similarity values is greater than a given threshold,
fixed to 0.25 in our tests, the cluster is linked to
the domain that is the most similar to it. The sim-
ilarity measure is:
sim(d; c) =
4
r
P
w
W

O
cl;t
(7)
where the w index is used for indicating com-
mon words between the cluster c and the seman-
tic domain d and the t index, for indicating all
the words of the cluster or the domain. W is the
weight of a word and O its occurrence number.
The similarity measure is only based on the
common words. As learning is unsupervised and
incremental, differences at time t might disappear
at time t+1. The comparison is based on the pro-
portion of common words relative to the total of
words of each entity to be compared. The evalu-
ation of the common words in each entity is done
according to their occurrence number and their
weight. So, we avoid to obtain a high similarity
value between two entities that only share very
few words having a high weight. We combine
these criteria in a geometrical mean for evaluating
each entity and for computing the global similar-
ity from the evaluation of the two entities in order
to smooth the effect of few recurrent words when
the domains are in their formation phase, words
that would act as attractors otherwise.
4.1.2 Entropy-based classification
For each of the 71 clusters, we have searched
for the nearest domain obtained with the same
kind of entropy-based measure defined above. We
assume that we have a probabilistic model which
gives the predictions of the words according to the
domains. In order to avoid the null value, non-
learned events are infered using the Witten-Bell
interpolation (Witten and Bell, 1991). The inter-
polated value of the prediction of a word w, know-
ing the domain d is p0(wjd) such that:
p
0
(wjd) =
O(w; d) + n
sw
(d)=V
O(d) + n
sw
(d)
(8)
where n
sw
(d) is the number of words seen in each
domain and V the size of the vocabulary. Each
cluster is also defined by a set of words and we
compare the distribution of the words in the clus-
ter with the distributions of the words in the do-
mains (equation 8) with the Kullback-Leibler di-
vergence. Each cluster is associated with the near-
est domain.
4.1.3 Comparison
The results of the two classifications described
above are given in Table 4. For the similarity-
based classification, only 3 clusters do not match
with any domain and 47 different domains are se-
lected for the 68 remaining clusters with 34 links
that are one cluster-one domain. For the entropy-
based classification, 44 clusters have been associ-
ated to the 71 domains.
Several clusters are linked to the same domain.
This can been explained by the closeness of some
of the domains. This is shown when they are hi-
erarchically classified; we obtain then 34 general
domains that regroup 1 to 5 domains each. We
also observe that most clusters are only linked to
one domain. The two methods give almost the
same results and show that the two classifications
are similar.

4.2.1 A simple comparison
One domain and one cluster are associated to
each thematic unit. It is then possible to calcu-
late the number of domains and clusters which
partially or fully overlap. Table 5 represents the
intersection between the two partitions. For each
domain we chose the cluster which has the highest
intersection with the domain. Then we calculated
the percentage of thematic units of this domain
which are both in the domain and in this chosen
cluster.

ters which correspond to the highest intersection
Height domains are identical to height clusters.
The lowest coverage (18%) is obtained for one
domain. The other seventy domains cover more
than 20% of the clusters.
4.2.2 Comparison with the  coefficient
In order to compare more precisely our two
classifications, we used the  coefficient as it was
done by Dietterich in (Dietterich, 2000) and as it
is often done in the field of remote sensing for ex-
ample. The  coefficient measures the degree of
agreement among several judgements and is ex-
pressed as follows:
k =

1
  
2
1  
2
(9)
where 
1
is the proportion of times that the
judgments agree and 
2
is the proportion of times
that we could expect the judgments to agree by
chance. As we are in a case of unsupervised clas-
sification whereas Dietterich?s work was about
supervised classification (building of decision
trees), we have first set a one-to-one mapping
between the semantic domains and the clusters.
This was done by a very simple procedure: we
computed the size of the intersection between
each cluster and each domain; then we iteratively
mapped the cluster and the domain that had the
largest intersection until each cluster was mapped
with a domain. Of course, this is not an optimal
procedure in order to ensure that the intersection
of each couple of classes is the largest one but it
can be considered as a baseline.
Then, the evaluation of the  coefficient was
done by building a matrix K  K, with K, the
number of classes (clusters or domains), such that
each element k
i;j
is equal to the number of TUs
assigned to the class i by SEGAPSITH and to the
class j by the entropy-based clustering. 
1
, which
estimates the probability that the two classifica-
tions agree, is defined by:

1
=
P
K
i=1
k
i;i
N
(10)
where N is the total number of TUs. It eval-
uates the proportion of TUs that were put in the
same classes by the two clustering algorithms.

2
, which estimates the probability that the two
algorithms agree by chance, is given by:

2
=
K
X
i=1
(
k
i+
N

k
+i
N
) (11)
where k+i
N
and ki+
N
are the marginal distribu-
tions.
The  coefficient that results from the evalu-
ation of 
1
and 
2
is equal to 0 when the two
clustering algorithms agree only by chance and
to 1 when they really agree for each TU. Negative
values occur when there is a systematic disagree-
ment.
For the 71 classes of our test set, we computed
the  coefficient in two cases. First, with a ran-
dom mapping of the clusters and domains. We
got K = -0.013, which is very close to the agree-
ment by chance. Second, we applied the above
mapping procedure and got K = 0.484, which in-
dicates a significant correlation between the two
classifications. We think that with a more com-
plex mapping procedure, the  would be higher.
4.2.3 Application of the Mantel Test
In this paradigm, each classified thematic unit,
tu, is described according to its position in the
classification in relation to all the classified el-
ements. This position is characterized by a dis-
tance between tu and each other element. In the
work we present here, we choose a simple dis-
tance: dist(tu
1
; tu
2
) = 0 if tu
1
and tu
2
are part
of the same class; otherwise, dist(tu
1
; tu
2
) = 1.
However more complex distances may be used
when the classifications are hierarchical ones for
example. After this first step, each tu
i
of the two
classifications to compare is characterized by a
vector, each element of which, d
ij
, is equal to
the distance between tu
i
and tu
j
. Hence, each
classification is characterized by a distance ma-
trix, which is a square symmetric matrix of size
N
2
= 4935
2
. Comparing the two classifica-
tions amounts to compare their distance matrices.
In the ecology field, such kind of comparison is
achieved by a statistical test, called the Mantel
test (Mantel, 1967). In (Legendre, 2000), Legen-
dre defines the Mantel test as ? a procedure to test
the hypothesis that the distances among objects
in a matrix A are linearly independent of the dis-
tances among the same objects in another matrix
B. The result of this test may be used as support
for or against the hypothesis that the process that
generated the first set of distances is independent
of the process that generated the second set. The
unique feature of the Mantel test is the use of a
linear statistic to assess the relationship between
two distance matrices?. The basic statistic used in
the Mantel test is the Z statistic:
ZS =
i=N
X
i=1
j=N
X
j=1
x
ij
y
ij
As the elements of a distance matrix are not in-
dependent, the significance of ZS, the Z statistic
that is computed for the two distance matrices to
compare, is evaluated by comparing this value to
the Z statistic that is computed for matrices whose
rows and columns are randomly permuted. A dis-
tribution of random values is obtained by comput-
ing the statistic for many permuted matrices and
if ZS is significantly above this distribution, the
hypothesis that the two matrices are independent
is rejected 1.
1The Z statistic is maximal when the two distance matri-
ces are identical: the x
ij
y
ij
term is not equal to zero only if
x
ij
and y
ij
are equal to 1. Hence, each difference that could
be introduced between the two matrices, decreases its value.
As an exploratory step, we applied the Man-
tel test in order to compare the results of the two
classification methods we presented in this arti-
cle. We used the software developed by Adam
Liedloff (Liedloff, 1999). As the number of
TUs is too large in comparison with the capabil-
ities of this software, we experimented the Man-
tel test only on a subset of 1000 TUs. With the
distance matrix computed from the results of the
two classification methods, we got a Z statistic
(ZS) equal to 940; 894. The maximum value of
ZS is 978; 460 for the domains and 948; 608 for
the clusters. The random distribution was built
from 99 permuted matrices and its ZS value is
937; 708  232. As the proportion of the val-
ues from the random distribution that are above
ZS is equal to zero, we can reject the hypothe-
sis that the two matrices are independent and as a
consequence, we can think that the two compared
classifications are globally similar. However, as
the results of the Mantel test are not easy to inter-
pret, further tests must be performed to see what
are the relations between these results and those
of the other comparing methods and to determine
if this test is actually suited for comparing such
kind of classifications.
5 Conclusion
We presented in this paper an approach for eval-
uating the results of an unsupervised learning
method, when no human evaluation is possible or
when no classification exists as a reference. As
a result, this method builds classes of weighted
words that regroup thematic units. We defined
in a previous work a stability threshold of these
classes, thus we aim at evaluating this subset of
classes. To do that, we applied another clustering
method that only needs to know the number of
classes to build on the same subset of TUs and we
reformulate our evaluation problem in comparing
the two classifications. Our first results lead to
show a great correlation between the two results.
We now have to develop other tests, for exam-
ple on a different number of classes, to verify our
first results. A second step will be to evaluate the
methods on the same task, as a classification task
for example, whose protocol has to be defined.
