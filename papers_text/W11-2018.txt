Abstract
Detecting levels of interest from speakers
is a new problem in Spoken Dialog Under-
standing with significant impact on real world
business applications. Previous work has fo-
cused on the analysis of traditional acous-
tic signals and shallow lexical features. In
this paper, we present a novel hierarchical fu-
sion learning model that takes feedback from
previous multistream predictions of promi-
nent seed samples into account and uses a
mean cosine similarity measure to learn rules
that improve reclassification. Our method is
domain-independent and can be adapted to
other speech and language processing areas
where domain adaptation is expensive to per-
form. Incorporating Discriminative Term Fre-
quency and Inverse Document Frequency (D-
TFIDF), lexical affect scoring, and low and
high level prosodic and acoustic features, our
experiments outperform the published results
of all systems participating in the 2010 Inter-
speech Paralinguistic Affect Subchallenge.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been growing interest in
identifying speakers? emotional state from speech
(Devillers and Vidrascu, 2006; Ai et al, 2006; Lis-
combe et al, 2005). For Spoken Dialog Systems
(SDS), the motivation has been to provide users with
improved over-the-phone services by recognizing
emotions such as anger and frustration and direct-
ing users to a human attendant. Other forms of par-
alinguistic information which researchers have at-
tempted to detect automatically include other classic
emotions, charismatic speech (Biadsy et al, 2008),
and deceptive speech (Hirschberg et al, 2005).
More recently, the 2010 Interspeech Paralinguisic
Affect Subchallenge sparked interest in detecting a
speaker?s level of interest (LOI), including both the
speaker?s interest in the topic and his/her willingness
to participating in the dialog (Schuller et al, 2010).
Sensing users? LOI in SDS should be useful in sales
domains, political polling, or service subscription.
In this paper, we present a similarity-based hi-
erarchical regression approach to predicting speak-
ers? LOI. The system has been developed based on
the hierarchical fusion learning of lexical and acous-
tic cues from speech. We investigate the contri-
bution of a novel source of information, Discrimi-
native TFIDF; lexical affect scoring; and prosodic
event features. Inspired by the successful use of
Pseudo Relevance Feedback (Tao and Zhai, 2006)
techniques in Information Retrieval and the cosine
similarity measure (Salton, 1989) in Data Mining,
we design a novel learning model which takes the
multistream prediction feedback that is initially re-
turned from seed samples 1 and uses a mean cosine
similarity measure to calculate the distance between
the new instance and prominent seed data points in
the Euclidean Space. We then add this similarity
measure as a new feature to perform a reclassifi-
cation. Our main contributions in this paper are:
(1) the novel Discriminative TFIDF approach for
lexical modeling and keywords spotting; (2) using
lexical affect scoring and language modeling tech-
niques to augment lexical modeling; (3) combin-

ing (1) and (2) with additional low-level prosodic
features together with voice quality and high-level
prosodic event features; and (4) introducing a mul-
tistream prediction feedback and mean cosine simi-
larity based fusion learning approach.
We outline related work in Section 2. The corpus,
system features, and machine learning approaches
are described in Section 3. We describe our experi-
mental results in Section 4 and conclude in Section
5.
2 Related Work
Schuller et al (2006) were among the first to study
LOI from conversational speech. They framed this
task as either a three-way or binary classification,
extracting standard acoustic features and building a
bag-of-words vector space model for lexical anal-
ysis. By linearly combining lexical features with
acoustic features, they achieved high F-measures
when using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Since
a bag-of-words model is a naive model, there may
be more valuable lexical information that it cannot
capture. Moreover, as lexical and acoustic features
are extracted from different domains, a single layer
linear combination may not yield the optimal results.
In 2010, Interspeech launched a Paralinguistic
Challenge (Schuller et al, 2010) that included the
task of detecting LOI from speech as a subchallenge.
Competitors were given conversational speech cor-
pora with annotated LOI, baseline acoustic features,
and two baseline results. The evaluation metric used
for the challenge was primarily the cross correlation
2 (CC) measure (Grimm et al, 2008), with mean
linear error 3 (MLE) also taken into consideration.
The baseline was built only on acoustic features, and
the CC and MLE for Training vs. Development sets
were 0.604 and 0.118. For the test data, CC and
MLE scores of 0.421 and 0.146 were observed.
Gajsek et al (2010) participated in this challenge
and proposed the use of Gaussian Mixture Models
as Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) with
relevance MAP estimation for the acoustic data.
This is based on the success of GMM-UBM mod-

sure of the linear dependence that is widely used in regression
settings.

solute error between an estimator and the true value.
eling in the speaker identification tasks (Reynolds et
al., 2000). They achieved CC and MLE of 0.630 and
0.123 in the training vs. development condition, but
CC and MLE of only 0.390 and 0.143 in the testing
condition. This performance may have been due to
the fact that different subsets of the corpus include
different speakers: acoustic features alone may not
be robust enough to capture the speaker variation.
Jeon et al (2010) approach won the 2010 Sub-
challenge for this task. In addition to the baseline
acoustic features provided, they used term frequency
and a subjectivity dictionary to mine the lexical in-
formation. In addition to a linear combination of
all lexical and acoustic features, they designed a hi-
erarchical regression framework with multiple level
of combinations. Its first two combiners tackle the
prediction problems from different acoustic classi-
fiers and then uses a final stage SVM classifier to
combine the overall acoustic predictions with lexi-
cal predictions to form the final output. They report
a result of 0.622 for CC and 0.115 for MLE. On the
test set, they report CC and MLE of 0.428 and 0.146
respectively.
3 Our System
Unlike previous approaches, we emphasize lexical
modeling, to counter problems of speaker variation
in acoustic features (Jeon et al, 2010). We propose
an improved version of standard TFIDF (Spa?rck
Jones, 1972) ? Discriminative TFIDF ? which
computes the IDF score of the target word by dis-
criminating its different mean LOI score tags during
training to produce more informative keyword spot-
ting in testing.
In addition to Discriminative TFIDF, we uti-
lize the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL)
(Whissell, 1989) to detect lexical affect and com-
pute an utterance-level affect score. To maximize
the coverage of lexical cues, we also train trigram
language models on the training data to capture con-
textual information and use the test output log like-
lihoods and perplexities as features. Besides these
lexical features and the 1582 baseline acoustic fea-
tures from the Interspeech Paralinguistic Challenge,
we extract 32 additional prosodic and voice quality
features using Praat (Boersma, 2001). In order to
model sentence-level prosodic events, we use Au-
153
ToBI (Rosenberg, 2010) to extract pitch accent and
phrase-based features. These features are described
in detail in Section 3.2.
The simplest approach to classification is to in-
clude all features in a single classifier. However,
different features streams include different number
of features, extracted and represented in different
domains. The Sum Rule approach (Kittler et al,
1998) is an early solution to this classifier combi-
nation problem. Instead, we train 1st-tier classi-
fiers for each of the feature streams and then train
a 2nd-tier classifier to weight the posterior predic-
tions of the 1st-tier classifiers. We further improve
this method by integrating a novel model which con-
siders the 1st-tier multistream prediction feedback
from the seed samples and uses a mean cosine simi-
larity method to measure the distance between a new
instance and prominent seed samples. We use this
similarity measure to improve classification.
3.1 Corpus
The corpus we use in our experiments is the 2010
Paralinguistic Challenge Affect Subchallenge cor-
pus Technische Universta?t Munche?n Audiovisual In-
terest Corpus (TUM AVIC), provided by Schuller
(2010). The corpus consists of 10 hours of audio-
visual recordings of interviews in which an inter-
viewer provides commercial presentations of vari-
ous products to a subject. The subject and inter-
viewer discuss the product, and the subject com-
ments on his/her interest in it. Subjects were in-
structed to relax and not to worry about politeness
in the conversation. 21 subjects participated (11
male, 10 female), including three Asians and the rest
of European background. All interviews were con-
ducted in English; while none of the subjects were
native speakers, all were fluent. 11 subjects were
younger than 30; 7 were between 30-40; and 3 were
over 40. The subject portions of the recordings were
segmented into speaker turns (continuous speech by
one speaker with backchannels by the interviewer
ignored). These were further segmented into sub-
speaker turns at grammatical phrase boundaries such
that each segment is shorter than 2sec.
These smaller segments were annotated by four
male undergraduate psychology students for subject
LOI, using a 5-point scale as follows: (-2) Disin-
terest (subject is totally tired of discussing this topic
and totally passive); (-1) Indifference (subject is pas-
sive and does not want to give feedback); (0) Neu-
trality (subject follows and participates in the dialog,
but it is not recognized if she/he is interested in the
topic); (1) Interest (subject wants to talk about the
topic, follows the interviewer and asks questions);
(2) Curiosity (subject is strongly interest in the topic
and wants to learn more.) A normalized mean LOI
is then derived from mean LOI/2, to map the scores
into [-1, +1]. (Note that no negative scores occur
for this corpus.) In our experiments, we consider
the normalized mean LOI score as the label for each
sub-speaker turn segment; we refer to this as ?mean
LOI? below. The corpus was divided for the Sub-
challenge into training, development, and test cor-
pora; we use these divisions in our experimens.
3.2 Feature Sets
Table 1 provides an overview of the feature sets in
our system.
Discriminative TFIDF
In the standard vector space model, each word
is associated with its Term Frequency (TF) in the
utterance. The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
provides information on how rare the word is over
all utterances. The standard TFIDF vector of a term
t in an utterance u is represented as V(t,u):
V (t, u) = TF ? IDF =
C(t, u)
C(v, u)
? log
|U |
?
u(t)
TF is calculated by dividing the number of occur-
rences of term t in the utterance u by the total num-
ber of tokens v in the utterance u. IDF is the log of
the total number of utterances U in the training set,
divided by the number of utterances in the training
set in which the term t appears. u(t) can be viewed
as a simple function: if t appears in utterance u, then
it returns 1, otherwise 0.
In Discriminative TFIDF we add additional infor-
mation to the TFIDF metrics. When calculating IDF,
we weight each word by the distribution of its labels
in the training set. This helps us to weight words by
the LOI of the utterances they are uttered in. An in-
tuitive example is this: Although the words ?chaos?
and ?Audi? both appear once in the corpus, the oc-
currence of ?Audi? is in an utterance with a Mean
LOI score of 0.9, while ?chaos? appears in an utter-
ance with a label of 0.1. A standard TFIDF approach

will give these two terms the same score. To differ-
entiate the importance of these two words, we define
our Discriminative TFIDF measure as follow:
V (t, u) =
C(t, u)
C(v, u)
?log
|U |
?
u(t) ? (1? |MeanLOI|)
Here, the Mean LOI score ranging from (0,1) is
the label of each utterance. Instead of summing
the u(t) scores directly, we now assign a weight to
each utterance. The weight is (1? |MeanLOI|) in
our task. The overall IDF score of words important
to identifying the LOI of an utterance will thus be
boosted, as the denominator of the IDF metric de-
creases compared to the standard TFIDF. Discrimi-
native TFIDF can be viewed as a generalized version
of Delta TFIDF (Martineau and Finin, 2009) that can
be used in various regression settings.
Wang and McKeown (2010) show that adding
Part-of-Speech (POS) information to text can be
helpful in similar classification tasks. So we have
also used the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and
Manning, 2000) to tag these transcripts before cal-
culating the Discriminative TFIDF score.
Lexical Affect Scoring
Whissell?s Dictionary of Affect in Language
(DAL) (Whissell, 1989) attempts to quantify emo-
tional language by asking raters to judge 8742 words
collected from various sources including college es-
says, interviews, and teenagers descriptions of their
own emotional state. Its pleasantness (EE) score in-
dicates the negative or positive valence of a word,
rated on a scale from 1 to 3. For example, ?aban-
don? scores 1.0, implying a fairly low level of pleas-
antness. A previous study (Agarwal et al, 2009)
notes that one of the advantages of this dictionary
is that it has different scores for various forms of a
root word. For example, the words ?affect? and ?af-
fection? have very different meanings; if they were
given the same score, the lexical affect quantifica-
tion might not be discriminative. To calculate an
utterance?s lexical affect score, we first remove the
stopwords and then sum up 4 the EE score of each
word in the utterance.
Statistical Language Modeling
In order to capture the contextual information and
maximize the use of lexical information, we also
train a statistical language model to augment the
Discriminative TFIDF and lexical affect scores. We
train trigram language models on the training set
using the SRI Language Modeling Tookit (Stolcke,
2002). In the testing stage, the log likelihood and
perplexity scores are used as language modeling fea-
tures. Due to the data sparsity issue, we are not able
to train language models on subsets of training data
that correspond to different LOI scores.
4We have experimented with Min, Max and Mean scores,
but the results were poor.
155
Acoustic, Prosodic and Voice Quality Features
As noted above, the TUM AVIC corpus includes
acoustic features (Schuller et al, 2010) for all of the
data sets. These include: PCM loudness, MFCC[0-
14], log Mel Frequency Band[0-7], Line Spectral
Pairs Frequency [0-7], F0 by Sub-Harmonic Sum.,
F0 Envelope, Voicing Probability, Jitter Local, Jit-
ter Difference of Difference of Periods, and Shim-
mer local. We have extracted an additional 32 stan-
dard prosodic and voice quality features to aug-
ment these, including Glottal Pulses, Voicing, Jitter,
Shimmer, Harmonicity, Duration, Fundamental Fre-
quency, and Energy (See Table 1).
Prosodic Event Features
To examine the contribution of higher-level
prosodic events, we have also experimented with
AuToBI (Rosenberg, 2010) to automatically de-
tect pitch accents, word boundaries, intermedi-
ate phrase boundaries, and intonational bound-
aries in utterances. AuToBI requires annotated
word boundary information; since we do not have
hand-annotated boundaries, we use the Penn Pho-
netics Lab Forced Aligner (Yuan and Liberman,
2008) to align each utterance with its transcription.
We use AuToBI?s models, which were trained on
the spontaneous speech Boston Directions Corpus
(BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), to identify
prosodic events in our corpus.
3.3 Fusion Learning Approaches
Assuming that our various lexical, acoustic and
prosodic feature streams are informative to some ex-
tent when tested separately, we want to combine in-
formation from the streams in different domains to
improve prediction. We experimented with several
approaches, including Bag-of-Features, Sum Rule
combination, Hierarchical Fusion, and a new ap-
proach. We present here results of each on our LOI
prediction task. In the Bag-of-Features approach,
a simple classification method includes all features
in a single classifier. A potential problem with this
method is that, when combining 1582 acoustic fea-
tures with 10 lexical features, the classifier will treat
them equally, so potentially more useful lexical fea-
tures will not be evaluated properly. A second prob-
lem is that our features are extracted from differ-
ent domains using different methods, and normal-
ization across domains is not possible in a bag-of-
features classification/regression approach. Another
possible approach is the Sum Rule Combiner, which
uses product or sum rules to combine the predictions
from 1st-tier classifiers. Kittler et al (1998) show
that the Sum Rule approach outperforms the product
rule, max rule and mean rule approaches when com-
bining classifiers. Their sensitivity analysis shows
that this approach is most resilient to estimation er-
rors.
A third method of combining features is the Hier-
archical Fusion approach of fusing multistream in-
formation, which involves multiple classifiers and
performs classification/regression in multiple stages.
This can be implemented by first training 1st-tier
classifiers for each single stream of features, collect-
ing the predictions from these classifiers, and train-
ing a 2nd-tier supervector classifier to weight the im-
portance of predictions from the different streams
and make a final prediction. The rationale behind
this approach is to solve the cross-domain issue by
letting the 2nd-tier classifier weight the streams, as
the predictions from 1st-tier classifiers will be in a
unified/normalized form (e.g. 0 to 1 in this task).
The Multistream Prediction Feedback and Mean
Cosine Similarity based Hierarchical Fusion
Our Multistream Prediction Feedback and Mean
Cosine Similarity based Hierarchical Fusion ap-
proach combines a similarity based two-stage ap-
proach with a multistream feedback approach. Fig-
ure 1 shows the architecture of this system. It is
based on the intuition that, if we can identify the
prominent samples (e.g. the samples that all 1st-tier
classifiers assign high average prediction scores),
then we can measure the average distance between
a new sample and all these prominent samples in the
Euclidean Space. Furthermore, we can use this av-
erage distance (average similarity) as a new feature
to improve the 2nd-tier classifier?s final prediction.
To implement this process, we first train five
1st-tier Additive Logistic Regression (Friedman et
al., 2000) classifiers and a Random Subspace meta
learning (Ho, 1998) 1st-tier classifier (for the acous-
tic stream), using six different feature streams in our
training data. In the testing stage, we use a random
subset of the test set as seed samples. Next, we run
the seed samples for each of these 1st-tier classifiers

Final Prediction
Figure 1: The Overview of Multistream Prediction Feedback and Mean Cosine Similarity based Hierarchical
Fusion Learning
to obtain prediction scores ranging from 0 to 1. Now,
we take the mean of these predicted scores for each
sample, and use the following method to select the
top n samples from the seed samples S as ?promi-
nent samples?:
Prominent(S, n) = Maxn(Mean(S))
Recall that the cosine similarity (Salton, 1989) of
two utterances Ui, Uj in the vector-space model is:
cos(Ui, Uj) =
Ui ? Uj
||Ui||2 ? ||Uj ||2
where ??? indicates ?dot product?. Now, given our
hypothesized prominent samples, for each of these
samples and new samples, we choose the original
Discriminative TFIDF, Lexical Affect Scoring, Lan-
guage Modeling, Prosodic and Voice Quality, and
Prosodic Event features as k vectors to represent all
the samples in Euclidean Space. The reason we drop
the acoustic features from the vector space model is
because of the dimensionality issue ? 1582 acous-
tic features. We substitute our 32 standard prosodic
features instead. Now we use the mean cosine simi-
larity score to represent how far a new sample Un is
from the prominent samples US in the space:
Sim(Un, US) = Mean
?
?
?k
i=1 Vn ? Vs?
?k
i=1 V
2
n ?
?
?k
i=1 V
2
s
?
?
In the next step, we add this mean cosine sim-
ilarity measure as a new feature and include it in
the 2nd-tier classifier for reclassification. Now, in
the reclassification stage, all 1st-tier feature stream
predictions will be re-weighted by the new 2nd-tier
classifier that incorporated with Multistream Feed-
back information.
The reason why the Multistream Prediction Feed-
back is useful in this task is that, like many spoken
language understanding tasks, in LOI detection, if
we have a different set of speakers with different
genders, ages, and speaker styles, the overall feature
distribution for lexical, prosodic, and acoustic cues
in the test set can be very different from the training
set. Traditional speaker adaptation techniques typi-
157
cally focus only on the acoustic stream and may be
very expensive to perform. So, by extracting more
knowledge about the lexical, prosodic, and acoustic
features distributions in test set using our novel ap-
proach, we will have a better understanding about
the skewed distributions in the test set. In addition,
our approach is inexpensive and does not require ex-
tra unlabeled data.
4 Experiments and Results
We conduct our experiments in three parts. First, we
examine how well the Discriminative TFIDF feature
performs, compared with standard TFIDF feature.
Secondly, we look at how different feature sets influ-
ence our results. For the first two parts, we evaluate
our features using the Subchallenge training vs. de-
velopment sets only. Finally, we compare our sim-
ilarity based multistream fusion feedback approach
to other feature-combining approaches. We exam-
ine our final system first comparing training vs. de-
velopment performance, and then combined training
and development sets vs. the test set. WEKA (Wit-
ten and Frank, 2005) and LIBSVM (Chang and Lin,
2001) are used for regression.

When working with the training and develop-
ment sets, we are able to access the label and tran-
scriptions of each set to calculate the Discrimina-
tive TFIDF scores. For the testing scenario dis-
cussed in in Section 4.3, we do not have these anno-
tations. So, we redefine the task as a keyword spot-
ting task, where we can use the identified keywords
in the training and development sets as keyword fea-
tures in testing. We also sum up the word-level
TFIDF scores and use the sentence-level TFIDF as
a single feature for the classification experiment.
The regression algorithm we use is Additive Logis-
tic Regression with 50 iterations. Table 2 shows
how different approaches perform in the experiment.
We see that the Syntactic Discriminative TFIDF ap-
proach is much more informative than the standard
TFIDF approach. Note that, after calculating the
global IDF score, the standard TFIDF approach se-
lects 732 terms as top-1 level keywords. In contrast,
our Discriminative TFIDF has stronger discrimina-
tive power and picks a total number of 59 truly rare
terms as top-1 level keywords.

and prosodic features are the dominating features in
this task. The Prosodic Events feature stream also
emerges as a new informative high-level prosodic
feature in this task.
When testing the multistream feedback informa-
tion as a single feature stream, we see in the bottom
half of Table 3 that CC and MLE are improved when
we increase the number of prominent samples. Dis-
criminative TFIDF and Language Modeling are also
158
important, as seen from these results, but the Lexi-
cal Affect Scoring feature performs best among the
lexical features in this task. We suspect that the rea-
son may be a data sparsity issue, as we do not have a
large amount of data for training robust global Dis-
criminative IDF scores, language models, and the
feedback stream. In contrast, the DAL is trained on
much larger amounts of data.

Table 4: Comparing Different Systems. Above: Train-
ing vs. Development. Bottom: Combined Training+ De-
velopment vs. Test. CC: Cross Correlation. MLE: Mean
Linear Error.
Note that, in order to transcribe the test data, we
have trained a 20 Gaussian per state 39 MFCC Hid-
den Markov Model speech recognizer with HTK, us-
ing the training and development sets together with
TIMIT (Fisher et al, 1986), the Boston Directions
Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996),
and the Columbia Game Corpus (Hirschberg et al,
2005). The word error rate (WER) is 29% on the
development set.
Note that a Bag-of-Features approach combin-
ing all features results in poorer performance than
the use of acoustic features alone. The Sum Rule
approach improves over this method by achieving
CC score of 0.422. Although the improvement of
CC seems small, it is extremely statistically signifi-
cant (Paired t-test with two-tailed P-value less than
0.0001), comparing to the Bag-of-features model.
However, when using the SVM as the 2nd-tier su-
pervector classifier to weight different prediction
streams, we achieve 0.628 CC and 0.115 MLE in
training vs. development data, and 0.450 CC and
0.131 MLE on the test set; this result is significantly
different from the Bag-of-features baseline (paired
t-test, p < 0.0001), but it is not significantly differ-
ent from the Sum Rule Combination approach.
Augmenting the SVM hierarchical fusion learn-
ing approach with multistream feedback, we observe
a significant improvement over all other systems and
methods. We obtain a final CC of 0.480 and MLE of
0.131 in the test mode, which is sigificantly differ-
ent from the Bag-of-features approach (paired t-test
p < 0.0001), but does not differ significantly from
the SVM hierarchical fusion approach.
5 Conclusion
Detecting levels of interest from speakers is an im-
portant problem for Spoken Dialog Understanding.
While earlier work, done in the 2010 Interspeech
Paralinguistic Affect Subchallenge, employing tra-
ditional acoustic features and shallow lexical fea-
tures, achieved good results, our new features ?
Discriminative TFIDF, lexical affect scoring, lan-
guage modeling, prosodic event ? when used with
standard prosodic features and our new Multistream
Prediction Feedback and Mean Cosine Similarity
heuristic-based Hierarchical Learning method im-
proves over all published results on the LOI cor-
pus. Our method is domain-independent and can
be adapted to other speech and language process-
ing areas where domain adaptation is expensive to
perform. In the future, we would like to experiment
with different distributional similarity measures and
bootstrapping strategies.
