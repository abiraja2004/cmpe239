Abstract
This paper describes the design of a sys-
tem for extracting keyphrases from a sin-
gle document The principle of the algo-
rithm is to cluster sentences of the doc-
uments in order to highlight parts of text
that are semantically related. The clusters
of sentences, that reflect the themes of the
document, are then analyzed to find the
main topics of the text. Finally, the most
important words, or groups of words, from
these topics are proposed as keyphrases.
1 Introduction
Keyphrases are words, or groups of words, that
capture the key ideas of a document. They repre-
sent important information concerning a document
and constitute an alternative, or a complement, to
full-text indexing. Pertinent keyphrases are also
useful to potential readers who can have a quick
overview of the content of a document and can se-
lect easily which document to read.
Currently, the most powerful keyphrases extrac-
tion algorithms are based on supervised learning.
These methods address the problem of associat-
ing keyphrases to documents as a classification
task. However, the fact that this approach requires
a corpus of similar documents, which is not al-
ways readily available, constitutes a major draw-
back. For example, if one encounters a new Web
page, one might like to know quickly the main top-
ics addressed. In this case, a domain-independent
keyword extraction system that applies to a single
document is needed.
Several methods have been proposed for ex-
tracting keywords from a single document (Mat-
suo and Ishizuka, 2004; Palshikar, 2007). The re-
ported performances were slightly higher than that
obtained using a corpus and selecting the words
with the highest TF-IDF 1 measure (Salton et al,
1975).
The paper describes a new keyphrase extraction
algorithm from a single document. We show that
our system performs well without the need for a
corpus.
The paper is organized as follows. The next sec-
tion describes the principles of our keyphrase ex-
traction system. We present the main parts of the
algorithm in section 3, we detail the methods in
section 4 and we conclude the paper.
2 Principles
When authors write documents, they have to think
first at the way they will present their ideas. Most
of the time, they establish content summaries that
highlight the main topics of their texts. Then, they
write the content of the documents by carefully
selecting the most appropriate words to describe
each topic. In this paper, we make the assumption
that the words, or the set of words, that are repre-
sentative of each topic constitute the keyphrases of
the document. In the following of this paper, we
call terms, the components of a document that con-
stitute the vocabulary (see the detail of the identi-
fication of terms in subsection 4.3).
In statistical natural language processing, one
common way of modeling the contributions of dif-
ferent topics to a document is to treat each topic as
a probability distribution over words. Therefore, a
document is considered as a probabilistic mixture
of these topics (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
Generative models can be used to relate a set of
observations (in our case, the terms used in a doc-
ument) to a set of latent variables (the topics). A
particular generative model, which is well suited
for the modeling of text, is called Latent Dirichlet
1The TF-IDF weight gives the degree of importance of a
word in a collection of documents. The importance increases
if the word is frequently used in the set of documents but
decreases if it is used by too many documents.

Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003). Given a set
of documents, the algorithms describes each doc-
ument as a mixture over topics, where each topic
is characterized by a distribution over words.
The idea is to perform first a clustering of the
sentences of the document based on their semantic
similarity. Intuitively, one can see each cluster as
a part of the text dealing with semantically related
content. Therefore, the initial document is divided
into a set of clusters and LDA can then be applied
on this new representation.
3 Algorithm
The algorithm is composed of 8 steps:
1. Identification and expansion of abbrevia-
tions.
2. Splitting the content of the document into m
sentences.
3. Identification of the n unique terms in the
document that are potential keyphrases.
4. Creation of a m ? n sentence-term matrix
X to identify the occurrences of the n terms
within a collection of m sentences.
5. Dimensionality reduction to transform data in
the high-dimensional matrix X to a space of
fewer dimensions.
6. Data clustering performed in the reduced
space. The result of the clustering is used to
build a new representation of the source doc-
ument, which is now considered as a set of
clusters, with each cluster consisting of a bag
of terms.
7. Execution of LDA on the new document rep-
resentation.
8. Selection of best keyphrases by analyzing
LDA?s results.
4 Methods
Our implementation is build on UIMA (Un-
structured Information Management Architecture)
(http://incubator.apache.org/uima/ ), a robust and
flexible framework that facilitates interoperability
between tools dedicated to unstructured informa-
tion processsing. The method processes one doc-
ument at a time by performing the steps described
below.
4.1 Abbreviation Expansion
The program ExtractAbbrev (Schwartz and Hearst,
2003) is used to identify abbreviations (short
forms) and their corresponding definitions (long
forms). Once abbreviations have been identified,
each short form is replaced by its corresponding
long form in the processed document.
4.2 Sentence Detection
Splitting the content of a document into sentences
is an important step of the method. To per-
form this task, we used the OpenNLP?s sentence
detector module (http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/ )
trained on a corpus of general English texts.
4.3 Term Identification
Word categories are identified by using the Ling-
Pipe?s general English part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ger trained on the Brown Corpus (http://alias-
i.com/lingpipe/ ). We leverage POS information to
collect, for each sentence, nominal groups that are
potential keyphrases.
4.4 Matrix Creation
Let D = {d
1
, d
2
, . . . , d
n
} be the complete vo-
cabulary set of the document identified in subsec-
tion 4.3 above. We build a m?n matrix X = [x
ij
]
where m is the number of sentences in the doc-
ument, n is the number of terms and x
ij
is the
weight of the j
th
term in the i
th
sentence. The
weight of a term in a sentence is the product of a
local and global weight given by x
ij
= l
ij
? g
j
,
where l
ij
is the local weight of term j within sen-
tence i, and g
j
is the global weight of term j in
the document. The local weighting function mea-
sures the importance of a term within a sentence
and the global weighting function measures the
importance of a term across the entire document.
Three local weighting functions were investigated:
term frequency, log of term frequency and binary.
Five global weighting functions were also inves-
tigated: Normal, GFIDF (Global frequency ? In-
verse document frequency, IDF (Inverse document
frequency), Entropy and none (details of calcula-
tion can be found in Dumais (1991) paper).
4.5 Dimensionality Reduction
The matrix X is a representation of a document in
a high-dimensional space. Singular Value Decom-
position (SVD) (Forsythe et al, 1977) and Non-
Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and
155
Seung, 1999) are two matrix decomposition tech-
niques that can be used to transform data in the
high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimen-
sions.
With SVD, the original matrix X is decom-
posed as a factor of three other matrices U , ? and
V such as:
X = U?V
T
where U is an m?m matrix, ? is a m?n diagonal
matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diag-
onal, and V T denotes the transpose of V , an n?n
matrix. It is often useful to approximate X using
only r singular values (with r < min(m,n)), so
that we have X = U
r
?
k
V
T
r
+ E, where E is an
error or residual matrix, U
r
is an m ? r matrix,
?
r
is a k ? r diagonal matrix, and V
r
is an n ? r
matrix.
NMF is a matrix factorization algorithm that
decomposes a matrix with only positive elements
into two positive elements matrices, with X =
WH+E. Usually, only r components are fit, so E
is an error or residual matrix, W is a non-negative
m ? r matrix and H is a non-negative r ? n ma-
trix. There are several ways in which W and H
may be found. In our system, we use Lee and Se-
ung?s multiplicative update method (Lee and Se-
ung, 1999).
4.6 Sentence Clustering
The clustering of sentences is performed in the
reduced space by using the cosine similarity be-
tween sentence vectors. Several clustering tech-
niques have been investigated: k-means cluster-
ing, Markov Cluster Process (MCL) (Dongen,
2008) and ClassDens (Gue?noche, 2004).
The latent semantic space derived by SVD does
not provide a direct indication of the data par-
titions. However, with NMF, the cluster mem-
bership of each document can be easily identi-
fied directly using the W matrix (Xu et al, 2003).
Each value w
ij
of matrix W , indicates, indeed, to
which degree sentence i is associated with clus-
ter j. If NMF was calculated with the rank r,
then r clusters are represented on the matrix. We
use a simple rule to determine the content of each
cluster: sentence i belongs to cluster j if w
ij
>
a max
k?{1...m}
w
ik
. In our system, we fixed a = 0.1.
4.7 Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation
By using the result of the clustering, the source
document is now represented by c clusters of
terms. The terms associated with a clus-
ter c
i
is the sum of the terms belonging to
all the sentences in the cluster. JGibbLDA
(http://jgibblda.sourceforge.net/ ) is used to exe-
cute LDA on the new dataset. We tried to ex-
tract different numbers of topics t (with t ?
{2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}) and we choose the Dirich-
let hyperparameters such as ? = 0.1 and ? =
50/t. LDA inferences a topic model by estimating
the cluster-topic distribution ? and the topic-word
distribution ? (Blei et al, 2003).
4.8 Term Ranking and Keyphrase Selection
We assume that topics covering a significant por-
tion of the document content are more important
than those covering little content. To reflect this
assumption, we calculate the importance of a term
in the document (its score) with a function that
takes into account the distribution of topics over
clusters given by ?, the distribution of terms over
topics given by ? and the clusters? size.
score(i) = max
j?{1...n}
(?
ji
c
?
k=1
(?
kj
p(s(k)))
where score(i) represents the score of term i and
s(k) is the size of the cluster k. We tested three
different functions for p: the constant function
p(i) = 1, the linear function p(i) = i and the
exponential function p(i) = i2.
When a score is attributed to each term of
the vocabulary, our system simply selects the top
terms with the highest score and proposes them as
keyphrases.
4.9 Setting Tuning Parameters
Numerous parameters have influence on the
method: the weighting of the terms in the doc-
ument matrix, the dimension reduction method
used, the number of dimension retained, the clus-
tering algorithm, the number of topics used to ex-
ecute LDA and the way best keyphrases are se-
lected.
The parameter that most affects the perfor-
mance is the method used to perform the dimen-
sion reduction. In all cases, whatever the other
parameters, NMF performs better than SVD. We
found that using only 10 components for the fac-
torization is sufficient. There was no significant
performance increase by using more factors.
The second most important parameter is the
clustering method used. When NMF is used, the
156
best results were achieved by retrieving clusters
from the W matrix. With SVD, ClassDens gets
the best results. We tested the performance of k-
means clustering by specifying a number of clus-
ters varying from 5 to 100. The best performances
were achieved with a number of clusters ? 20.
However, k-means scores a little bit below Class-
Dens and MCL is found to be the worst method.
The choice of the global weighting function is
also important. In our experiments, the use of IDF
and no global weighting gave the worst results.
Entropy and normal weighting gave the best re-
sults but, on average, entropy performs a little bet-
ter than normal weight. In the final version, the
global weighting function used is entropy.
The last parameter that has a visible influence
on the quality of extracted keyphrases is the selec-
tion of keyphrases from LDA?s results. In our ex-
periments, the exponential function performs best.
The remaining parameters do not have notable
influence on the results. As already stated by Lee
et al (2005), the choice of local weighting func-
tion makes relatively little difference. Similarly,
the number of topics used for LDA has little in-
fluence. In our implementation we used term fre-
quency as local weighting and executed LDA with
a number of expected topics of 10.
5 Results and Conclusion
In Task 5, participants are invited to provide the
keyphrases for 100 scientific papers provided by
the organizers. Performances (precision, recall
and F-score) are calculated by comparing the pro-
posed keyphrases to keywords given by the au-
thors of documents, keywords selected by inde-
pendant readers and a combination of both. Com-
pared to other systems, our method gives the
best results on the keywords assigned by read-
ers. By performing the calculation on the first 5
keyphrases, our system ranks 9th out of 20 submit-
ted systems, with an F-score of 14.7%. This is be-
low the best method that obtains 18.2%, but above
the TD-IDF baseline of 10.44%. The same calcu-
lation performed on the first 15 kephrases gives a
F-score of 17.80% for our method (10th best F-
score). This is still below the best method, which
obtains an F-score of 23.50%, but a lot better than
the TD-IDF baseline (F-score=12.87%).
The evaluation shows that the performance of
our system is near the average of other submitted
systems. However, one has to note that our system
uses only the information available from a single
document. Compared to a selection of keywords
based on TF-IDF, which is often used as a refer-
ence, our system provides a notable improvement.
Therefore, the algorithm described here is an inter-
esting alternative to supervised learning methods
when no corpus of similar documents is available.
