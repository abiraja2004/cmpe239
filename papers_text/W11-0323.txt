Abstract
We investigate the use of Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL) in opinion detection both in
sparse data situations and for domain adapta-
tion. We show that co-training reaches the best
results in an in-domain setting with small la-
beled data sets, with a maximum absolute gain
of 33.5%. For domain transfer, we show that
self-training gains an absolute improvement in
labeling accuracy for blog data of 16% over
the supervised approach with target domain
training data.
1 Introduction
Rich and free opinions published electronically and,
more recently, on the WWW offer ample opportuni-
ties to discover individual?s attitudes towards certain
topics, products, or services. To capitalize on this
enormous body of opinions, researchers have been
working in the area of opinion mining since the late
1990s. Opinion detection seeks to automatically de-
termine the presence or absence of opinions in a text,
and it is therefore a fundamental task for opinion
mining.
In order to capture subtle and creative opinions,
opinion detection systems generally assume that a
large body of opinion-labeled data are available.
However, collections of opinion-labeled data are of-
ten limited, especially at the granularity level of sen-
tences; and manual annotation is tedious, expensive
and error-prone. The shortage of opinion-labeled
data is less challenging in some data domains (e.g.,
reviews) than in others (e.g., blog posts). A sim-
ple method for improving accuracies in challenging
domains would be to borrow opinion-labeled data
from a non-target data domain; but this approach
often fails because opinion detection strategies de-
signed for one data domain generally do not perform
well in another domain. One reason for failure of
the simple transfer approach is that the information
used for opinion detection is typically lexical, and
lexical means of expressing opinions may vary not
only from domain to domain, but also from register
to register. For example, while the word ?awesome?
is a good indicator of an opinion in blogs, it is less
likely to occur in the same role in newspaper texts.
While it is difficult to obtain opinion-labeled data,
one can easily collect almost infinite unlabeled user-
generated data that contain opinions. The use of
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), motivated by lim-
ited labeled data and plentiful unlabeled data in the
real world, has achieved promising results in vari-
ous NLP studies (e.g., (Fu?rstenau and Lapata, 2009;
Talukdar and Pereira, 2010)), yet it has not been
fully investigated for use in opinion detection. Al-
though studies have shown that simple SSL meth-
ods are promising for extracting opinion features
or patterns using limited opinion-labeled data (e.g.,
(Wiebe and Riloff, 2005)), few efforts have been
made either to apply SSL directly to opinion detec-
tion or to examine more sophisticated SSL methods.
This research is intended to fill the gap regarding ap-
plication of SSL in opinion detection. We investi-
gate a range of SSL algorithms with a focus on self-
training and co-training in three types of electronic
documents: edited news articles, semi-structured
movie reviews, and the informal and unstructured
content of the blogosphere. We conclude that SSL
is a successful method for handling the shortage of
opinion labeled data and the domain transfer prob-
lem.

2 Background and Related Work
There is a wide range of literature on opinion detec-
tion. We concentrate here on supervised and semi-
supervised approaches.
2.1 Supervised Learning for Opinion Detection
Supervised learning algorithms that can automati-
cally learn important opinion-bearing features from
an annotated corpus have been adopted and inves-
tigated for opinion detection and yielded satisfying
results (Wiebe et al, 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou,
2003; Zhang and Yu, 2007). With no classifica-
tion techniques developed specifically for opinion
detection, state-of-the-art topical supervised classifi-
cation algorithms can achieve performance compa-
rable to complex linguistic approaches when using
binary values (i.e., presence or absence) and incor-
porating different types of features. Commonly used
opinion-bearing features include bag-of-words, POS
tags, ngrams, low frequency words or unique words
(Wiebe et al, 2004; Yang et al, 2007), semantically
oriented adjectives (e.g., ?great?, ?poor?) and more
complex linguistic patterns. Both the scale and qual-
ity of the annotated corpus play an important role in
the supervised learning approach.
2.2 SSL for Opinion Detection
In contrast to supervised learning, SSL learns from
both labeled and unlabeled data. SSL assumes that,
although unlabeled data hold no information about
classes (e.g., ?opinion? or ?non-opinion?), they do
contain information about joint distribution over
classification features. Therefore, when a limited set
of labeled data is available in the target domain, us-
ing SSL with unlabeled data is expected to achieve
an improvement over supervised learning.
Self-training Self-training is the simplest and
most commonly adopted form of SSL for opinion
detection. Self-training was originally used to fa-
cilitate automatic identification of opinion-bearing
features. For example, Riloff and Wiebe (2003) pro-
posed a bootstrapping process to automatically iden-
tify subjective patterns. Self-training has also been
applied directly for identifying subjective sentences
by following a standard self-training procedure: (1)
train an initial supervised classifier on the labeled
data; (2) apply this classifier to unlabeled data and
select the most confidently labeled data, as deter-
mined by the classifier, to augment the labeled data
set; and (3) re-train the classifier by restarting the
whole process. Wiebe and Riloff (2005) used a self-
trained Na??ve Bayes classifier for classifying subjec-
tive sentences and achieved better recall with modest
precision over several rule-based classifiers.
One shortcoming of self-training is that the result-
ing data may be biased: That is, the final labeled data
may consist of examples that are easiest for this par-
ticular opinion detector to identify.
Co-training The core idea of co-training is to use
two classifiers and trade additional examples be-
tween them, assuming that the resulting union of
classified examples is more balanced than examples
resulting from using either classifier alone. When
labeling new examples, a final decision is made by
combining the predictions of the two updated learn-
ers. The original co-training algorithm assumes re-
dundancy in the training data and thus more than
one view can be used to represent and classify each
example independently and successfully (Blum and
Mitchell, 1998). For example, an image can be nat-
urally represented by its text description or by its
visual attributes. Even when a natural split in the
feature set is not available, studies have shown that
the key to co-training is the existence of two largely
different initial learners, regardless of whether they
are built by using two feature sets or two learning
algorithms (Wang and Zhou, 2007).
When there are different views for the target ex-
amples, co-training is conceptually clearer than self-
training, which simply mixes features. Since co-
training uses each labeled example twice, it requires
less labeled data and converges faster than self-
training. However, the lack of natural feature splits
has kept researchers from exploring co-training for
opinion detection. To the best of our knowledge,
the only co-training application for opinion detec-
tion was reported by Jin et al (2009), who created
disjoint training sets for building two initial classi-
fiers and successfully identified opinion sentences in
camera reviews by selecting auto-labeled sentences
agreed upon by both classifiers.
EM-Based SSL Expectation-Maximization (EM)
refers to a class of iterative algorithms for
maximum-likelihood estimation when dealing with
201
incomplete data. Nigam et al (1999) combined
EM with a Na??ve Bayes classifier to resolve the
problem of topical classification, where unlabeled
data were treated as incomplete data. The EM-NB
SSL algorithm yielded better performance than ei-
ther an unsupervised lexicon-based approach or a
supervised approach for sentiment classification in
different data domains, including blog data (Aue and
Gamon, 2005; Takamura et al, 2006). No opinion
detection applications of EM-based SSL have been
reported in the literature.
S3VMs Semi-Supervised Support Vector Ma-
chines (S3VMs) are a natural extension of SVMs in
the semi-supervised spectrum. They are designed to
find the maximal margin decision boundary in a vec-
tor space containing both labeled and unlabeled ex-
amples. Although SVMs are the most favored super-
vised learning method for opinion detection, S3VMs
have not been used in opinion detection. Graph-
based SSL learning has been successfully applied to
opinion detection (Pang and Lee, 2004) but is not
appropriate for dealing with large scale data sets.
2.3 Domain Adaptation for Opinion Detection
When there are few opinion-labeled data in the
target domain and/or when the characteristics of
the target domain make it challenging to detect
opinions, opinion detection systems usually borrow
opinion-labeled data from other data domains. This
is especially common in opinion detection in the bl-
ogosphere (Chesley et al, 2006). To evaluate this
shallow approach, Aue and Gamon (2005) com-
pared four strategies for utilizing opinion-labeled
data from one or more non-target domains and con-
cluded that using non-targeted labeled data without
an adaptation strategy is less efficient than using la-
beled data from the target domain, even when the
majority of labels are assigned automatically by a
self-training algorithm.
Blitzer et al (2007) and Tan et al (2009) imple-
mented domain adaptation strategies for sentiment
analysis. Although promising, their domain adapta-
tion strategies involved sophisticated and computa-
tionally expensive methods for selecting general fea-
tures to link target and non-target domains.
3 Motivation and Objective
While SSL is especially attractive for opinion de-
tection because it only requires a small number of
labeled examples, the studies described in the previ-
ous section have concentrated on simple SSL meth-
ods. We intend to fill this research gap by comparing
the feasibility and effectiveness of a range of SSL
approaches for opinion detection. Specifically, we
aim to achieve the following goals:
First, to gain a more comprehensive understand-
ing of the utility of SSL in opinion detection. We
examine four major SSL methods: self-training, co-
training, EM-NB, and S3VM. We focus on self-
training and co-training because they are both wrap-
per approaches that can be easily adopted by any ex-
isting opinion detection system.
Second, to design and evaluate co-training strate-
gies for opinion detection. Since recent work has
shown that co-training is not restricted by the orig-
inal multi-view assumption for target data and that
it is more robust than self-training, we evaluate new
co-training strategies for opinion detection.
Third, to approach domain transfer using SSL,
assuming that SSL can overcome the problem of
domain-specific features by gradually introducing
targeted data and thus diminishing bias from the
non-target data set.
4 SSL Experiments
Our research treats opinion detection as a binary
classification problem with two categories: subjec-
tive sentences and objective sentences. It is evalu-
ated in terms of classification accuracy.
Since a document is normally a mixture of facts
and opinions (Wiebe et al, 2001), sub-document
level opinion detection is more useful and meaning-
ful than document-level opinion detection. Thus, we
conduct all experiments on the sentence level.
The remainder of this section explains the data
sets and tools used in this study and presents the ex-
perimental design and parameter settings.
4.1 Data Sets
Three types of data sets have been explored in opin-
ion detection studies: news articles, online reviews,
and online discourse in blogs or discussion forums.
These three types of text differ from one another in
202
terms of structure, text genre (e.g., level of formal-
ity), and proportion of opinions found therein. We
selected a data set from each type in order to inves-
tigate the robustness and adaptability of SSL algo-
rithms for opinion detection and to test the feasibil-
ity of SSL for domain adaptation.
Movie Review One of the standard data sets in
opinion detection is the movie review data set cre-
ated by Pang and Lee (2004). It contains 5,000 sub-
jective sentences or snippets from the Rotten Toma-
toes pages and 5,000 objective sentences or snip-
pets from IMDB plot summaries, all in lowercase.
Sentences containing less than 10 tokens were ex-
cluded and the data set was labeled automatically
by assuming opinion inheritance: every sentence in
an opinion-bearing document expresses an opinion,
and every sentence in a factual document is factual.
Although this assumption appears to be acceptable
for movie review data, it is generally unreliable for
other domains.
News Article The Wall Street Journal part of the
Penn Treebank III has been manually augmented
with opinion related annotations. This set is widely
used as a gold-standard corpus in opinion detection
research. According to the coding manual (Wiebe
et al, 1999), subjective sentences are those express-
ing evaluations, opinions, emotions, and specula-
tions. For our research, 5,174 objective sentences
and 5,297 subjective sentences were selected based
on the absence or presence of manually labeled sub-
jective expressions.
JDPA Blog Post The JDPA corpus (Kessler et al,
2010) is a new opinion corpus released in 2010. It
consists of blog posts that express opinions about
automobile and digital cameras with named entities
and sentiments expressed about them manually an-
notated. For our purpose, we extracted all sentences
containing sentiment-bearing expressions as subjec-
tive sentences and manually chose objective sen-
tences from the rest by eliminating subjective sen-
tences that were not targeted to any labeled entities.
After this process, we had approximately 10,000
subjective sentences and 4,348 objective sentences.
To balance the number of subjective and objective
sentences, we used 4,348 sentences from each cate-
gory.
4.2 Data Preparation
We removed a small number of stop words. No
stemming was conducted since the literature shows
no clear gain from stemming in opinion detection.
One reason for this may be that stemming actually
erases subtle opinion cues such as past tense verbs.
All words were converted to lowercase and numbers
were replaced by a placeholder #. Both unigrams
and bigrams were generated for each sentence.
Each data set was randomly split into three por-
tions: 5% of the sentences were selected as the eval-
uation set and were not available during SSL and
supervised learning (SL) runs; 90% were treated as
unlabeled data (U) for SSL runs and i% (1 ? i ? 5)
as labeled data (L) for both SL and SSL runs. For
each SSL run, a baseline SL run was designed with
the same number of labeled sentences (i%) and a
full SL run was designed with all available sentences
(90% + i%). If effective, an SSL run would signifi-
cantly outperform its corresponding baseline SL run
and approach the performance of a full SL run.
4.3 Experimental Design
We conducted three groups of experiments: 1) to in-
vestigate the effectiveness of the SSL approach for
opinion detection; 2) to explore different co-training
strategies; and 3) to evaluate the applicability of SSL
for domain adaptation.
4.3.1 General Settings for SSL
The Na??ve Bayes classifier was selected as the
initial classifier for self-training because of its abil-
ity to produce prediction scores and to work well
with small labeled data sets. We used binary values
for unigram and bigram features, motivated by the
brevity of the text unit at the sentence level as well
as by the characteristics of opinion detection, where
occurrence frequency has proven to be less influen-
tial. We implemented two feature selection options:
Chi square and Information Gain.
Parameters for SSL included: (1) Threshold k for
number of iterations. If k is set to 0, the stopping
criterion is convergence; (2) Number of unlabeled
sentences available in each iteration u (u << U );
(3) Number of opinion and non-opinion sentences,
p and n, to augment L during each iteration; and (4)
Weighting parameter ? for auto-labeled data. When
? is set to 0, auto-labeled and labeled data are treated
203
equally; when ? is set to 1, feature values in an
auto-labeled sentence are multiplied by the predic-
tion score assigned to the sentence.
We used the WEKA data mining software (Hall
et al, 2009) for data processing and classifica-
tion of the self-training and co-training experi-
ments. EM implemented in LingPipe (Alias-i, 2008)
was used for the EM-NB runs. S3VMs imple-
mented in SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) and based
on local search were adopted for the S3VM runs.
Since hyper-parameter optimization for EM-NB and
S3VM is not the focus of this research and prelim-
inary explorations on parameter settings suggested
no significant benefit, default settings were applied
for EM-NB and S3VM.
4.3.2 Co-Training Strategies
For co-training, we investigated five strategies for
creating two initial classifiers following the criteria
that these two classifiers either capture different fea-
tures or based on different learning assumptions.
Two initial classifiers were generated: (1) Us-
ing unigrams and bigrams respectively to create two
classifiers based on the assumption that low-order
n-grams and high-order n-grams contain redundant
information and represent different views of an ex-
ample: content and context; (2) Randomly splitting
feature set into two; (3) Randomly splitting train-
ing set into two; (4) Applying two different learn-
ing algorithms (i.e., Na??ve Bayes and SVM) with
different biases; and (5) Applying a character-based
language model (CLM) and a bag-of-words (BOW)
model where the former takes into consideration the
sequence of words while the latter does not. In prac-
tice, for strategy (1), bigrams were used in combina-
tion with unigrams because bigrams alone are weak
features when extracted from limited labeled data at
sentence level.
Auto-labeled sentences were selected if they were
assigned a label that both classifiers agreed on with
highest confidence. Because our initial classifiers vi-
olated the original co-training assumptions, forcing
agreement between confident predictions improved
the maintenance of high precision.
4.3.3 Self-Training for Domain Adaptation
Based on the literature and our preliminary re-
sults (Yu and Ku?bler, 2010), movie reviews achieve

the highest accuracy while news articles and blog
reviews are considerably more challenging. Thus,
we decided to use movie reviews as source data
and news articles and blog posts as target data do-
mains. While the data split for the target domain re-
mains the same as in section 4.2, all sentences in the
source domain, except for the 5% evaluation data,
were treated as labeled data. For example, in order
to identify opinion-bearing sentences from the blog
data set, all 9,500 movie review sentences and i%
of blog sentences were used as labeled data, 90% of
blog sentences were used as unlabeled data, and 5%
as evaluation data. We also applied a parameter to
gradually decrease the weight of the source domain
data, similar to the work done by Tan et al (2009).
5 Results and Evaluation
Overall, our results suggest that SSL improves ac-
curacy for opinion detection although the contribu-
tion of SSL varies across data domains and different
strategies need to be applied to achieve optimized
performance. For the movie review data set, almost
all SSL runs outperformed their corresponding base-
line SL runs and approached full SL runs; for the
news article data set, SSL performance followed a
similar trend but with only a small rate of increase;
for the blog post data set, SSL runs using only blog
data showed no benefits over the SL baseline, but
with labeled movie review data, SSL runs produced
results comparable with full SL result.
5.1 SSL vs. SL
Table 1 reports the performance of SSL and SL runs
on movie review data based on different numbers
204
of initial labeled sentences. Both the self- and co-
training runs reported here used the same parame-
ter settings: k=0, u=20, p=2, n=2, ? =0, with no
feature selection. The co-training results in Table
1 used a CLM and a BOW model (see section 5.2).
SL runs for co-training classified sentences based on
the highest score generated by two classifiers; SL
runs for S3VM applied the default SVM setting in
SVMlight; and SL runs for EM-NB used the Na??ve
Bayes classifier in the EM-NB implementation in
LingPipe.
Table 1 shows that, except for S3VM, SSL al-
ways outperforms the corresponding SL baseline on
movie reviews: When SSL converges, it achieves
improvement in the range of 8% to 34% over the SL
baseline. The fewer initial labeled data, the more
benefits an SSL run gained from using unlabeled
data. For example, using 100 labeled sentences, self-
training achieved a classification accuracy of 85.2%
and outperformed the baseline SL by 33.5%. Al-
though this SSL run was surpassed by 4.9% by the
full SL run using all labeled data, a great amount
of effort was saved by labeling only 100 sentences
rather than 9,500. Co-training produced the best
SSL results. For example, with only 200 labeled
sentences, co-training yielded accuracy as high as
93.8%. Overall, SSL for opinion detection on movie
reviews shows similar trends to SSL for traditional
topical classification (Nigam and Ghani, 2000).
However, the advantages of SSL were not as sig-
nificant in other data domains. Figure 1 demon-
strates the performance of four types of SSL runs
relative to corresponding baseline and full SL runs
for all three data sets. All SSL runs reported here
used 5% data as labeled data. Lines with different
patterns indicate different data sets, green triangles
mark baseline SL runs, green dots mark full SL runs,
and red crosses mark SSL runs. Numbers next to
symbols indicate classification accuracy. For each
line, if the red cross is located above the triangle,
it indicates that the SSL run improved over the SL
baseline; and, the closer the red cross to the upper
dot, the more effective was the SSL run. Figure 1
shows that S3VM degrades in performance for all
three data sets and we exclude it from the follow-
ing discussion. From movie reviews to news articles
to blog posts, the classification accuracy of baseline
SL runs as well as the improvement gained by SSL
Figure 1: Classification accuracy(%) of SSL and SL on
three data sets (i=5)
runs decreased: With greater than 80% baseline ac-
curacy on movie reviews, SSL runs were most effec-
tive; with slightly above 70% baseline accuracy on
news articles, self-training actually decreased per-
formance of the corresponding SL baseline while
co-training and EM-NB outperformed the SL base-
line only slightly; and with 60% or so baseline accu-
racy on blog posts, none of the SSL methods showed
improvement. We assume that the lower the baseline
accuracy, the worse the quality of auto-labeled data,
and, therefore, the less advantages is application of
SSL. We also found that the average sentence length
in blog posts (17 words) is shorter than the average
sentence length in either movie reviews (23.5 words)
or news articles (22.5 words), which posed an addi-
tional challenge because there is less information for
the classifier in terms of numbers of features.
Overall, for movie reviews and news articles, co-
training proved to be most robust and effective and
EM-NB showed consistent improvement over the
SL baseline. For news articles, EM-NB increased
accuracy from 63.5% to 68.8% with only 100 la-
beled sentences. For movie reviews, a close look at
EM-NB iterations shows that, with only 32 labeled
sentences, EM-NB was able to achieve 88% clas-
sification accuracy, which is close to the best per-
formance of simple Na??ve Bayes self-training using
300 labeled sentences. This implies that the prob-
205
Figure 2: Performance of four co-training strategies on movie review data
lem space of opinion detection may be successfully
described by the mixture model assumption of EM.
As for blog posts, since the performance of the base-
line classifiers was only slightly better than chance
(50%), we needed to improve the baseline accuracy
in order for SSL to work. One solution was to intro-
duce high quality features. We augmented feature
set with domain independent opinion lexicons that
have been suggested as effective in creating high
precision opinion classifier, but improvement was
only minimal. An alternative solution was to bor-
row more labeled data from non-blog domains(s).
Section 5.3 discusses dealing with a ?difficult? data
domain using data from an ?easy? domain.
The preliminary exploration of different parame-
ter settings for both self- and co-training showed no
significant benefit gained by setting the weight pa-
rameter ? or applying feature selection; and using
a larger number of unlabeled sentences u available
for each iteration did not improve results. Further
investigation is needed for an in-depth explanation.
5.2 Co-training
The best co-training runs reported in Table 1 and
Figure 1 used an 8-grams CLM to train one clas-
sifier and a BOW model to train the other classifier.
These two classifiers differ both in feature represen-
tation (i.e., character vs. word) and in learning al-
gorithm (language model vs. pure statistical model).
To investigate whether the two different classifiers
improve each other?s performance during iterations,
we analyzed the CLM and BOW classifiers individ-
ually. When comparing the BOW classifier during
co-training iterations to the performance of corre-
sponding SL runs based on BOW, the former us-
ing both CLM and BOW classifiers always outper-
formed the latter, indicating that the BOW classi-
fier learned from CLM. Similarly, the CLM classi-
fier also gained from the BOW classifier during co-
training.
Figure 2 shows that for the movie review do-
main, other simple co-training configurations also
produced promising results by using different fea-
ture sets (e.g., unigrams and the union of unigrams
and bigrams, or randomly split feature sets) or differ-
ent training sets. In the news domain, we observed
similar trends. This shows the robustness and great
potential of co-training. Because even with the lo-
gistic model to output probabilistic scores for the
SVM classifier, the difference in probabilities was
too small to select a small number of top predic-
tions, adding an SVM classifier for co-training did
206
not improve accuracy and is not discussed here.
An observation of the performance of self-
training and co-training over iterations confirmed
that co-training used labeled data more effectively
for opinion detection than self-training, as sug-
gested for traditional topical classification. We
found that, overall, co-training produces better per-
formance than self-training and reaches optimal per-
formance faster. For instance, with 500 labeled sen-
tences, a self-training run reached an optimal classi-
fication accuracy of 88.2% after adding 4,828 auto-
matically annotated sentences for training, while the
co-training run reached an optimal performance of
89.4% after adding only 2,588 sentences.
5.3 Domain Transfer
Even without any explicit domain adaptation meth-
ods, results indicate that simple self-training alone
is promising for tackling domain transfer between
the source domain movie reviews and the target do-
mains news articles and blog posts.
Target domain news articles We used 9,500 la-
beled movie review sentences to train a Na??ve Bayes
classifier for news articles. Although this classi-
fier produced a fairly good classification accuracy
of 89.2% on movie review data, its accuracy was
poor (64.1%) on news data (i.e., domain-transfer
SL), demonstrating the severity of the domain trans-
fer problem. Self-training with Na??ve Bayes using
unlabeled data from the news domain (i.e., domain-
transfer SSL run) improved the situation somewhat:
it achieved a classification accuracy of 75.1% sur-
passing the domain-transfer SL run by more than
17%. To finvestigate how well SSL handles the do-
main transfer problem, a full in-domain SL run that
used all labeled news sentences was also performed.
This full SL run achieved 76.9% classification accu-
racy, only 1.8% higher than the domain-transfer SSL
run, which did not use any labeled news data.
Target domain blog posts Because blog data are
more challenging than news data, we kept 5% blog
data as labeled data. Both SSL runs with and without
out-of-domain data are depicted in Figure 3. Self-
training using only blog data decreases SL baseline
performance (dashed black line). Keeping the same
settings, we added additional labeled data from the
movie reviews, and self-training (gray line) came
Figure 3: Self-training for domain transfer between
movie reviews (source domain) and blogs (target domain)
closer to the performance of the full SL run (red
line), which used 90% of the labeled blog data. We
then added a control factor that reduced the impact
of movie review data gradually (i.e., a decrease of
0.001 in each iteration). Using this control, the self-
training run (solid black line) reached and occasion-
ally exceeded the performance of the full SL run.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We investigated major SSL methods for identify-
ing opinionated sentences in three domains. For
movie review data, SSL methods attained state-of-
the-art results with a small number of labeled sen-
tences. Even without a natural feature split, dif-
ferent co-training strategies increased the baseline
SL performance and outperformed other SSL meth-
ods. Due to the nature of the movie review data, we
suspect that opinion detection on movie reviews is
an ?easy? problem because it relies, strictly speak-
ing, on distinguishing movie reviews from plot sum-
maries, which also involves genre classification. For
other manually created data sets that are expected
to reflect real opinion characteristics, the SSL ap-
proach was impeded by low baseline precision and
showed limited improvement. With the addition of
out-of-domain labeled data, however, self-training
exceeded full SL. This constitutes a successful new
approach to domain adaptation.
Future work will include integrating opinion lex-
icons to bootstrap baseline precision and exploring
co-training for domain adaptation.
