Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a recursive graph 
based scheme for semantic annotation of 
Chinese phrases. Compared with others, this 
scheme can fully differentiate hose Chinese 
phrases that comprise the same content 
words but hold different meanings due to 
their different word order or some involved 
function words, and capture the hierarchical 
conceptual structure of Chinese phrases, 
which underlies their main semantic 
information. We also give the guidelines for 
annotating various commonly used types of 
Chinese phrases. 
1 Introduction 
Semantically annotated linguistic data are 
important resources for natural language 
processing, and have been used in many 
NLP areas, e.g., parsing, word sense 
disambiguation, co-reference r solution and 
information extraction, etc. But due to huge 
efforts needed in building them and general 
difficulties in dealing with semantic 
information, such resources are scarcely seen 
for most languages including Chinese, if not 
all. 
In this paper, we focus on Chinese 
phrases and present a recursive graph based 
scheme for their semantic annotation. 
Compared with the same task for sentences, 
it only involves a relatively small data set 
and simple semantic information but has 
potential generality and application. 
One is at which goal the annotation is aimed. 
In our case, the goal is established to be to 
help disclose the correspondence b tween 
linguistic forms and meaning, which is also 
the primary goal in both traditional linguistic 
research (Chomsky, 1968) and natural 
language understanding (Allen, 1995). 
The other problem is whether the 
annotation can significantly contribute to the 
established goal. In our case, the answer is of 
course positive. First, the phrases themselves 
are a specific kind of linguistic forms, thus 
their semantic annotation directly provides 
the correspondence b tween them and their 
meanings. Second, by some kinds of analogy 
rules, these annotated phrases can be 
examples for deriving the correspondence 
between new phrases and their meanings. 
Third, as compared with western languages, 
Chinese language has a specific feature that 
its sentences form in roughly the same way 
as its phrases (Zhu, 1982), which shows that 
by some kinds of combinatory rules, the 
mapping between sentences and their 
meanings can also be determined based on 
the examples. 
The remainder of this paper is organised 
as the following. In section 2, we describe 
the motivation of introducing recursive 
graph. In section 3, we formally define what 
is a recursive graph. In section 4, we specify 
how commonly used types of Chinese 
phrases are annotated using recursive graph. 
In section 5, we give the conclusion and 
discuss ome future work. 
2 Motivation 
As a specific semantic annotation task, 
two problems hould be made clear at first. 
In general, semantic annotation of linguistic 
forms is to associate with them their 
101 
semantic information being represented in 
some formal languages or diagrams. With 
the semantic information involved varying, 
the formal languages or diagrams may be 
different. 
One commonly used diagram for 
semantic annotation of linguistic forms is 
dependent tree, in which the dependence or
control relationship between constituents of
a linguistic form is depicted (Langacker, 
1997). But such trees may be not powerful 
enough to differentiate those Chinese 
phrases that comprise the same content 
words but hold different meanings due to 
their word order or involved function words. 
As an example, consider 1) and 2) 1. 
1) 
/zousi/ /qiche/ 
smuggle car 
2) 
/qiche/ /zousi/ 
car smuggle 
Notice 1) and 2) contain the same content 
words, but hold different word order. 
Regarding their meanings, 1) is an 
ambiguous phrase, corresponding with two 
English translation phrases as 3) and 4). 
3) to smuggle cars 
4) smuggled cars 
The translation phrase for 2) is 5). 
5) the smuggling of cars 
So, there are altogether three meanings held 
by the two phrases. But the two content 
words can only form two dependent trees, 
listed in 6) and 7). 
1 In this paper, whenever listing a Chinese word, we 
always list its Pinyin included within two symbols 7', 
and its English translation. For a Chinese phrase, we 
furthermore list its English translation when 
necessary. 
6) ~ (/qiche/, car) 
t 
~L(/zousi/, smuggle) 
7) ;~ ~ (/zousi/, smuggle) 
t 
(/qich , car) 
Obviously, these two dependent trees cannot 
code the three meanings listed in 3), 4) and 
5). Only if we could see the same word 
;~1~ L(/zousi/, smuggle) semantically 
different in 1) and 2), we could add another 
dependent tree 8) to code 5), with 6) and 7) 
corresponding with 3) and 4) respectively. 
8) j~t~ L'(/zousi/, smuggle) 2 
t 
~ :~i~: (Iqichel, car) 
But this view is quite unintuitive, and will 
lead to contradictory. Consider other two 
phrases 9) and 10). 
9) 
/zousi/ /jituan/ 
smuggle bloc 
smuggling bloc 
10) 
/qiche/ /zousi/ /jituan/ 
car smuggle bloc 
car smuggling bloc 
Intuitively, the word :~l~/L(/zousi/, smuggle) 
in 2) holds the same meaning as the word in 
10), which subsequently is equivalent with 
the same word in 9). On the other hand, there 
is no reason to treat the same word 
~L (/zousi/, smuggle) semantically 
differently in 1) and 9), two typical noun 
2 To differentiate the two words, we add one quotation 
mark. 
102 
phrases. Particularly, they are both followed 
by a typical noun in the two phrases. 
The second problem for dependent tree to 
semantically annotate linguistic forms is that 
due to its tree nature, it cannot represent 
multi-dependence relationship, in which one 
node is controlled by several nodes. For 
example, consider 11). 
11) 
/xihuan/ /ziji/ /de/ /ren/ 
like self of people 
the people who like oneself 
Conventionally, its dependent tree should be 
12). 
12) ~ (/ren/, people) 
gX (/xihuan/, like) 
~ (/ziji/, self) 
But intuitively, there should be some 
dependence r lationship between )k(/ren/, 
people) and fl ~ (/ziji/, self). If we add this 
relationship, it will become agraph. 
2.2 Conceptual Graph 
Conceptual graph is another diagram for 
semantic annotation of linguistic forms, 
which comprises concepts and conceptual 
relationship denoted by linguistic forms 
(Eklund, 1996). Although it is claimed to 
be a directed graph in its original form, it is 
equivalent to an undirected graph in nature, 
with its relationship nodes and their directed 
edges replaced with an undirected edge to 
directly denote the relationship. 
One problem with this diagram for 
semantic annotation is that it cannot code the 
information about head, if any, in a linguistic 
form, which intuitively specifies the main 
information carried by a linguistic form. This 
will lead to severe problems when using the 
graph to represent linguistic forms. For 
example, both phrases 1) and 2) with all 
three meanings 3), 4) and 5) would be 
represented by the same diagram as in 13) 3 . 
13) ~/~ ~:~ 
(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) 
To differentiate the three meanings held 
by the two phrases, we suggest using the 
following two weighted graphs and one 
unweighted graph, i.e., 14), 15) and 16) to 
represent 3), 4) and 5) respectively. 
14) ~$L ~ 
(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) 
15, I I 
(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) 
16) \[ ~t~L ~ 
(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car) 
Here we basically use undirected graphs to 
annotate phrases, and introduce a rectangle 
to denote the head of a linguistic phrase, if 
any. Notice that we don't mark a head in 14), 
which means that we don't take the verb 
~L(/zousi/ ,  smuggle) as the head of the 
verb phrase as usual. In general, for most 
verb phrases like 14) in Chinese, they 
correspond with two modifier-center phrases 
like 15) and 16) that comprise the same 
content words but with different meanings. 
For such phrases, we generally use a 
headword to differentiate between the verb 
phrase and the two modifier-center phrases, 
and then use different headword to 
distinguish the two modifier-center phrases. 
Another problem with conceptual 
structure is concerned with its ability to deal 
with hierarchical structures. Although nested 
conceptual structure is introduced to

conceptual graph. 
103 
describe nested belief, one particular kind of 
hierarchical structures (Genevirve, 1998), 
some simple hierarchical structures cannot 
be distinguished or annotated appropriately. 
As an example, consider 17) and 18). 
17) ~ ~ ~L  ~ 
/piaoliang/ /de/ /zousi/ /qiche/ 
beautiful of smuggle car 
beautiful smuggled cars 
18) ~I~L ~. ,  ~ ~ 
/zousi/ /piaoliang/ /de/ /qiche/ 
smuggle beautiful of car 
to smuggle beautiful cars 
Using conceptual graph, we can annotate 
both of them as 19), in which case the two 
phrases cannot be distinguished. 
19) ~t~L~ ~ ~ ~  
If based on undirected graph plus head, 17) 
can be annotated as 20). 
20, 
But there will be no appropriate annotation 
for 18), because on the one hand, 
~( /q iche/ ,car )  should be coded as a head 
due to its relationship with ~g~(/piaoliang/, 
beautiful), on the other hand, it's role as the 
object of the verb ~L(/zousi/ ,  smuggle) 
makes it illegal to be a head. 
To differentiate 17) and 18), we further 
suggest specifying the embedded structures 
in linguistic forms in some way, and use 
circles to denote them. In such opinion, 17) 
can be annotated as 21) and 22) respectively. 
21) ~ 
In this diagram, the smaller rectangle 
denotes the head of the modifier-center 
phrase ~$/L~ (/zousiqiche/, smuggled 
cars), the circle codes the phrase as an 
embedded structure of the whole phrase, 
while bigger rectangle denotes the head of 
the whole phrase. 
22) :xT~ L ~  
In this diagram, the circle denotes the 
embedded structure $~, ;~~( /p iao f iang  
de qiche/, beautiful cars), while the rectangle 
denotes the head of the embedded structure. 
Notice the phrase on the whole is a verb 
phrase, so there is no head coded here. 
3. Recursive Graph 
One major concern for semantic annotation 
of linguistic forms is what semantic 
information will be coded, or more 
generally, what is their semantic 
information, which has long been a quite 
controversial question. From the point of 
view of concepts, linguistic forms including 
phrases emantically refer to concepts, which 
we think generally fall within four 
categories: 
a) preliminary concept. For example, we 
may see the word tl/~(/wu/, thing) 
denotes aprefiminary concept. 
b) compositional concept or situtm'on, 
which consists of some concepts and 
their relation 4. For example, phrase 1) 
with the meaning 3) denotes a 
situation including the concepts the 
two content words, :i~l~L(/zousi/, 
smuggle) and ~( /q iche / ,  car), 
denote respectively, and their 
relationship, ~llJ{:(/shoushi/, patient). 
4 relation is also a specific kind of concopts, e.g., 
~$(/shoushi/, patient) is a relation between 
~L(/zousi/, smuggle) and ~(/qicheJ, car). 
104 
c) subordinate concept or specific 
concept within a situation, for 
example, phrase 1) with the meaning 
4) refers to the concept denoted by 
~( /q iche / ,  car) in the situation 
mentioned in b). 
d) subordinate feature, or specific 
feature of a situation or a concept, 
which generally stands for the 
relationship between a situation or a 
concept and another unknown 
concept. Consider 23). 
23) ~r~i~l~ ~ ~b~ 
/guniang/ /de/ /waimao/ 
girl of appearance 
the appearance of girls 
In this phrase, the word ~t'~ 
(/waimao/, appearance) denotes a 
feature of the concept the word ~i~i~l~ 
(/guniang/, girl) denotes, and the 
value of this feature doesn't occur in 
this phrase. 
Notice that the concepts within one situation 
themselves may be compositional concepts, 
subordinate concepts or subordinate f atures, 
so the concepts that linguistic forms 
including phrases denote generally presents a 
kind of hierarchical structure. In fact, this 
hierarchical structure in return represents he 
main semantic information of linguistic 
forms. 
We introduce recursive graph as formal 
diagram to represent the hierarchical 
structure of linguistic forms. Let Po be the 
set of preliminary points, we call pc Po a O- 
level graph. Suppose Pi~-Po, Ei(~-Po) is the 
set of the edges between points in P1, 
Ri(~(PlX El)) is the set of relations between 
points in PI and edges in Et s, then: 
s Here, Edges are also points. An edge point 
connecting two other points here equals an edge in a 
traditional definition of graph. 
i) <P1, El, Ri> is a I-level 
compositional graph; 
ii) <<Pi, El, R~>, p> (peP9 is a 1- 
level point-headed graph; 
iii) <<P1, El, R/>, e> (e~E1) is a 1- 
level edge-headed graph; 
iv) 1-level concepts comprise 1-1evel 
compositional graphs, l-level 
point-headed graphs, and 1-level 
edge-headed graphs. 
Let ,_o=Po, Zn-1 be the set of (n-1)-leveI 
graphs, suppose Pn~(,.ouZiu .... ,Za4), 
(PnnXn.1)?NIL, En(C-Pn) is the set of the 
edges between points in P~, Rn(C(P=x En)) is 
the set of relations between points in P= and 
edges in En, then: 
v) 
vi) 
vii) 
viii) 
<P~, E~, Rn> is a n-level 
compositional graph; 
<<en,  En, Rn>, p> (P~Pn) is a n- 
level point-headed graph; 
<<P~, E~, Rn>, e> (e~En) is a n- 
level edge-headed graph; 
n-level concepts comprise n-level 
compositional graphs, n-level 
point-headed graphs, and n-level 
edge-headed graphs. 
Intuitively, O-level graph corresponds with 
preliminary points, compositional graph 
corresponds with situation, point-headed 
graph corresponds with subordinate concept, 
and edge-headed graph corresponds with 
subordinate f ature. 
4. Annotation Guidelines 
In general, Chinese phrases can roughly be 
classified into five categories, i.e., sub- 
predicate, verb-object, modifier-center, verb- 
complement, and coordinate. We give some 
examples in the following for each category. 
4.1 Sub-predicate 
105 
In general, the phrase :in this category 
denotes a compositional concept. For 
example, 24) can be annotated as 25). 
24) ~t/~ .l~ ~ 
/guniang/ /piaoliang/ 
girl beautiful 
Girls are beautiful 
25) ~ti~i l~ ~ 
Intuitively, the concept the word 
Jti!i~l~(/guniang/, irl) denotes has a feature, 
~t '~ (/waimao/, appearance), and its value 
is ~( /p iao l iang / ,  beautiful). In other 
words, there exists a relationship, i.e., 
~l'~(/waimao/, appearance), between the 
two concepts denoted by ~rdi~l~(/guniang/, 
girl) and ~-~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful) 
respectively 6. 
4.2 Verb-object 
Similar with sub-predicate phrases, the 
phrase in this category also denotes a 
compositional concept. Phrase 1) with the 
meaning 3) is an example, and can be 
annotated as 26). 
26) ~$~ ~ 
Intuitively, there exists a relationship, i.e., 
~l : ( /shoushi / ,  patient), between the two 
concepts denoted by ;~t~L (/zousi/, smuggle) 
and ~ (/qiche/, car) respectively. 
4.3 Modifier-center 
The phrase in this category generally denotes 
a subordinate concept. The center here in the 
phrase can be a verb, a noun or an adjective. 
As examples, 27) and 28) are annotated as 
29) and 30). 
27) 
28) 
/piaoliang/ /de/ /guniang/ 
beautiful of girl 
beautiful girls 
/guniang/ /de/ /piaoliang/ 
girl of beautiful 
the beauty of girls 
29) 
9b~ 
I 
Intuitively, the two concepts denoted by the 
two content words ~t  (/guniang/, girl) and 
~g~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful) in 27) and 28) 
hold the same relationship, i.e., 
?t'~(/waimao/, appearance) as in 24). The 
difference lies in that the phrases 27) and 28) 
both have a head, i.e., ~i~i~l~ (/guniang/, girl) 
and ~-~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful) 
respectively. 
Another example is 23), it denotes an 
subordinate f ature, annotated as 31) 7. 
I 
Intuitively, the concept denoted by 
~t ( /gun iang/ ,  girl) has a feature 
~b~ (/waimao/, appearance), which is the 
head of this phrase. 
4.4 Verb-complement 
For the phrase in this category, the semantic 
relationship between its two parts, i.e., verb 
and complement, is very complicated (Ma, 
1987); even there is no direct semantic links 
6 Unless necessary, we don't list the link between 
concepts and relation ames. 
7 The link between ~i~l~(/guniang/, girl) and 
~b~(/waimao/, appearance) denotes a relation 
between concepts and relationships. 
106 
between them sometimes. Consider 32) and 
33). 
32) 
/chi/ /bao/ 
eat full. 
to eat and be full 
33) ~ 't~ 
/pao/ /kuai/ 
run fast 
to run fast 
In 32), {~(/bao/, full) has a direct link with 
the agent of ~(/chi/, eat), in which sense the 
two concepts denoted by ~\[g(/bao/, full) and 
~(/chi/, eat) has no direct semantic link. We 
don't consider such phrases in our annotation 
temporarily. In contrast, in 33), 'I~(/kuai/, 
fast) acts as the value of one feature 
:~.~(/sudu/, speed) of ~(/pao/, run), in 
which sense it has a direct semantic link with 
~?~(/pao/, run). They form a subordinate 
concept, annotated as 34). 
34) ~-q  '\[~ 
4.5 Coordinate 
In general, the phrase in this category 
denotes a compositional concept. As an 
example, consider 35). 
35) 
/shi/ /sheng/ 
teacher student 
teacher and student 
Intuitively, there is a relationship, i.e., 
9-f (/bing/, and), between the two concepts 
denoted by the two words. So, it can be 
annotated as 36). 
36) ~ 
5 Conclusion and Future 
Work 
In this paper, we propose a recursive graph 
based scheme for semantic annotation of 
Chinese phrases. This scheme can fully 
differentiate those Chinese phrases that 
comprise the same content words but with 
different meaning due to their different word 
order or some involved function words. It 
can also capture the hierarchical conceptual 
structures of Chinese phrases, which 
determine their main semantic information. 
Now, we have annotated about 5,000 
Chinese phrases using this scheme. One 
methodological issue is that we also choose 
multi-character Chinese words as candidate 
annotation phrases. The reason is that unlike 
western languages, there is no clear-cut 
between words and phrases in Chinese, for 
most multi-character Chinese words, their 
components may also be words, and the 
meaning of the multi-character words tends 
to be strongly related with that of their 
component words. In this sense, the words 
can be treated as basic phrases. More 
importantly, such basic annotation examples 
can be more complete in the sense of 
coverage. 
Future work will extend to 50,000 
Chinese phrases. Another future work is to 
learn the rules that dete~ne the mapping 
between linguistic forms and meanings 
based on this annotation, and apply the rules 
to new phrases and sentences. If this can be 
successful, we can develop a semantic 
analyzer for Chinese without any syntactic 
analysis. In particular, we can avoid part-of- 
speeches or syntactic structures that have 
long been difficult notions for Chinese 
languages.
