Abstract
We propose a computational framework
for identifying linguistic aspects of polite-
ness. Our starting point is a new corpus
of requests annotated for politeness, which
we use to evaluate aspects of politeness
theory and to uncover new interactions
between politeness markers and context.
These findings guide our construction of
a classifier with domain-independent lexi-
cal and syntactic features operationalizing
key components of politeness theory, such
as indirection, deference, impersonaliza-
tion and modality. Our classifier achieves
close to human performance and is effec-
tive across domains. We use our frame-
work to study the relationship between po-
liteness and social power, showing that po-
lite Wikipedia editors are more likely to
achieve high status through elections, but,
once elevated, they become less polite. We
see a similar negative correlation between
politeness and power on Stack Exchange,
where users at the top of the reputation
scale are less polite than those at the bot-
tom. Finally, we apply our classifier to
a preliminary analysis of politeness vari-
ation by gender and community.
1 Introduction
Politeness is a central force in communication, ar-
guably as basic as the pressure to be truthful, in-
formative, relevant, and clear (Grice, 1975; Leech,
1983; Brown and Levinson, 1978). Natural lan-
guages provide numerous and diverse means for
encoding politeness and, in conversation, we con-
stantly make choices about where and how to use
these devices. Kaplan (1999) observes that ?peo-
ple desire to be paid respect? and identifies hon-
orifics and other politeness markers, like please,
as ?the coin of that payment?. In turn, polite-
ness markers are intimately related to the power
dynamics of social interactions and are often a
decisive factor in whether those interactions go
well or poorly (Gyasi Obeng, 1997; Chilton, 1990;
Andersson and Pearson, 1999; Rogers and Lee-
Wong, 2003; Holmes and Stubbe, 2005).
The present paper develops a computational
framework for identifying and characterizing po-
liteness marking in requests. We focus on re-
quests because they involve the speaker imposing
on the addressee, making them ideal for exploring
the social value of politeness strategies (Clark and
Schunk, 1980; Francik and Clark, 1985). Requests
also stimulate extensive use of what Brown and
Levinson (1987) call negative politeness: speaker
strategies for minimizing (or appearing to mini-
mize) the imposition on the addressee, for exam-
ple, by being indirect (Would you mind) or apolo-
gizing for the imposition (I?m terribly sorry, but)
(Lakoff, 1973; Lakoff, 1977; Brown and Levin-
son, 1978).
Our investigation is guided by a new corpus
of requests annotated for politeness. The data
come from two large online communities in which
members frequently make requests of other mem-
bers: Wikipedia, where the requests involve edit-
ing and other administrative functions, and Stack
Exchange, where the requests center around a di-
verse range of topics (e.g., programming, garden-
ing, cycling). The corpus confirms the broad out-
lines of linguistic theories of politeness pioneered
by Brown and Levinson (1987), but it also reveals
new interactions between politeness markings and
the morphosyntactic context. For example, the po-
liteness of please depends on its syntactic position
and the politeness markers it co-occurs with.
Using this corpus, we construct a polite-
ness classifier with a wide range of domain-
independent lexical, sentiment, and dependency
features operationalizing key components of po-
250
liteness theory, including not only the negative
politeness markers mentioned above but also el-
ements of positive politeness (gratitude, positive
and optimistic sentiment, solidarity, and inclusive-
ness). The classifier achieves near human-level ac-
curacy across domains, which highlights the con-
sistent nature of politeness strategies and paves the
way to using the classifier to study new data.
Politeness theory predicts a negative correlation
between politeness and the power of the requester,
where power is broadly construed to include so-
cial status, authority, and autonomy (Brown and
Levinson, 1987). The greater the speaker?s power
relative to her addressee, the less polite her re-
quests are expected to be: there is no need for her
to incur the expense of paying respect, and failing
to make such payments can invoke, and hence re-
inforce, her power. We support this prediction by
applying our politeness framework to Wikipedia
and Stack Exchange, both of which provide in-
dependent measures of social status. We show
that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to
achieve high status through elections; however,
once elected, they become less polite. Similarly,
on Stack Exchange, we find that users at the top of
the reputation scale are less polite than those at the
bottom.
Finally, we briefly address the question of how
politeness norms vary across communities and so-
cial groups. Our findings confirm established re-
sults about the relationship between politeness and
gender, and they identify substantial variation in
politeness across different programming language
subcommunities on Stack Exchange.
2 Politeness data
Requests involve an imposition on the addressee,
making them a natural domain for studying the
inter-connections between linguistic aspects of po-
liteness and social variables.
Requests in online communities We base our
analysis on two online communities where re-
quests have an important role: the Wikipedia
community of editors and the Stack Exchange
question-answer community.1 On Wikipedia, to
coordinate on the creation and maintenance of
the collaborative encyclopedia, editors can in-
teract with each other on user talk-pages;2 re-
1http://stackexchange.com/about
2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:User_pages
quests posted on a user talk-page, although pub-
lic, are generally directed to the owner of the talk-
page. On Stack Exchange, users often comment
on existing posts requesting further information or
proposing edits; these requests are generally di-
rected to the authors of the original posts.
Both communities are not only rich in user-
to-user requests, but these requests are also part
of consequential conversations, not empty social
banter; they solicit specific information or con-
crete actions, and they expect a response.
Politeness annotation Computational studies of
politeness, or indeed any aspect of linguistic prag-
matics, demand richly labeled data. We there-
fore label a large portion of our request data
(over 10,000 utterances) using Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk (AMT), creating the largest corpus with
politeness annotations (see Table 1 for details).3
We choose to annotate requests containing ex-
actly two sentences, where the second sentence
is the actual request (and ends with a question
mark). This provides enough context to the an-
notators while also controlling for length effects.
Each annotator was instructed to read a batch of
13 requests and consider them as originating from
a co-worker by email. For each request, the anno-
tator had to indicate how polite she perceived the
request to be by using a slider with values rang-
ing from ?very impolite? to ?very polite?.4 Each
request was labeled by five different annotators.
We vetted annotators by restricting their resi-
dence to be in the U.S. and by conducting a lin-
guistic background questionnaire. We also gave
them a paraphrasing task shown to be effective
for verifying and eliciting linguistic attentiveness
(Munro et al, 2010), and we monitored the an-
notation job and manually filtered out annotators
who submitted uniform or seemingly random an-
notations.
Because politeness is highly subjective and an-
notators may have inconsistent scales, we ap-
plied the standard z-score normalization to each
worker?s scores. Finally, we define the politeness
score (henceforth politeness) of a request as the
average of the five scores assigned by the annota-
tors. The distribution of resulting request scores
(shown in Figure 1) has an average of 0 and stan-

values correspond to polite requests (i.e., requests
with normalized annotations towards the ?very po-
lite? extreme) and negative values to impolite re-
quests. A summary of all our request data is shown
in Table 1.
Inter-annotator agreement To evaluate the re-
liability of the annotations we measure the inter-
annotator agreement by computing, for each batch
of 13 documents that were annotated by the same
set of 5 users, the mean pairwise correlation of the
respective scores. For reference, we compute the
same quantities after randomizing the scores by
sampling from the observed distribution of polite-
ness scores. As shown in Figure 2, the labels are
coherent and significantly different from the ran-
domized procedure (p < 0.0001 according to a
Wilcoxon signed rank test).5
Binary perception Although we did not im-
pose a discrete categorization of politeness, we
acknowledge an implicit binary perception of the
phenomenon: whenever an annotator moved a
slider in one direction or the other, she made a
binary politeness judgment. However, the bound-

measures are not suitable for this type of annotation, in which
labels are continuous rather than categorical.

ary between somewhat polite and somewhat im-
polite requests can be blurry. To test this intuition,
we break the set of annotated requests into four
groups, each corresponding to a politeness score
quartile. For each quartile, we compute the per-
centage of requests for which all five annotators
made the same binary politeness judgment. As
shown in Table 2, full agreement is much more
common in the 1st (bottom) and 4th (top) quar-
tiles than in the middle quartiles. This suggests
that the politeness scores assigned to requests that
are only somewhat polite or somewhat impolite
are less reliable and less tied to an intuitive notion
of binary politeness. This discrepancy motivates
our choice of classes in the prediction experiments
(Section 4) and our use of the top politeness quar-
tile (the 25% most polite requests) as a reference
in our subsequent discussion.
3 Politeness strategies
As we mentioned earlier, requests impose on the
addressee, potentially placing her in social peril if
she is unwilling or unable to comply. Requests
therefore naturally give rise to the negative po-
252
liteness strategies of Brown and Levinson (1987),
which are attempts to mitigate these social threats.
These strategies are prominent in Table 3, which
describes the core politeness markers we analyzed
in our corpus of Wikipedia requests. We do not
include the Stack Exchange data in this analysis,
reserving it as a ?test community? for our predic-
tion task (Section 4).
Requests exhibiting politeness markers are au-
tomatically extracted using regular expression
matching on the dependency parse obtained by the
Stanford Dependency Parser (de Marneffe et al,
2006), together with specialized lexicons. For ex-
ample, for the hedges marker (Table 3, line 19),
we match all requests containing a nominal subject
dependency edge pointing out from a hedge verb
from the hedge list created by Hyland (2005). For
each politeness strategy, Table 3 shows the aver-
age politeness score of the respective requests (as
described in Section 2; positive numbers indicate
polite requests), and their top politeness quartile
membership (i.e., what percentage fall within the
top quartile of politeness scores). As discussed at
the end of Section 2, the top politeness quartile
gives a more robust and more intuitive measure of
politeness. For reference, a random sample of re-
quests will have a 0 politeness score and a 25% top
quartile membership; in both cases, larger num-
bers indicate higher politeness.
Gratitude and deference (lines 1?2) are ways
for the speaker to incur a social cost, helping to
balance out the burden the request places on the
addressee. Adopting Kaplan (1999)?s metaphor,
these are the coin of the realm when it comes to
paying the addressee respect. Thus, they are indi-
cators of positive politeness.
Terms from the sentiment lexicon (Liu et al,
2005) are also tools for positive politeness, either
by emphasizing a positive relationship with the ad-
dressee (line 4), or being impolite by using nega-
tive sentiment that damages this positive relation-
ship (line 5). Greetings (line 3) are another way to
build a positive relationship with the addressee.
The remainder of the cues in Table 3 are neg-
ative politeness strategies, serving the purpose of
minimizing, at least in appearance, the imposition
on the addressee. Apologizing (line 6) deflects the
social threat of the request by attuning to the impo-
sition itself. Being indirect (line 9) is another way
to minimize social threat. This strategy allows the
speaker to avoid words and phrases convention-
ally associated with requests. First-person plural
forms like we and our (line 15) are also ways of
being indirect, as they create the sense that the
burden of the request is shared between speaker
and addressee (We really should . . . ). Though in-
directness is not invariably interpreted as polite-
ness marking (Blum-Kulka, 2003), it is nonethe-
less a reliable marker of it, as our scores indicate.
What?s more, direct variants (imperatives, state-
ments about the addressee?s obligations) are less
polite (lines 10?11).
Indirect strategies also combine with hedges
(line 19) conveying that the addressee is unlikely
to accept the burden (Would you by any chance
. . . ?, Would it be at all possible . . . ?). These too
serve to provide the addressee with a face-saving
way to deny the request. We even see subtle effects
of modality at work here: the irrealis, counterfac-
tual forms would and could are more polite than
their ability (dispositional) or future-oriented vari-
ants can and will; compare lines 12 and 13. This
parallels the contrast between factuality markers
(impolite; line 20) and hedging (polite; line 19).
Many of these features are correlated with each
other, in keeping with the insight of Brown and
Levinson (1987) that politeness markers are of-
ten combined to create a cumulative effect of in-
creased politeness. Our corpora also highlight in-
teractions that are unexpected (or at least unac-
counted for) on existing theories of politeness. For
example, sentence-medial please is polite (line 7),
presumably because of its freedom to combine
with other negative politeness strategies (Could
you please . . . ). In contrast, sentence-initial please
is impolite (line 8), because it typically signals a
more direct strategy (Please do this), which can
make the politeness marker itself seem insincere.
We see similar interactions between pronominal
forms and syntactic structure: sentence-initial you
is impolite (You need to . . . ), whereas sentence-
medial you is often part of the indirect strategies
we discussed above (Would/Could you . . . ).
4 Predicting politeness
We now show how our linguistic analysis can be
used in a machine learning model for automati-
cally classifying requests according to politeness.
A classifier can help verify the predictive power,
robustness, and domain-independent generality of
the linguistic strategies of Section 3. Also, by pro-
viding automatic politeness judgments for large

the strategy is perceived as being polite), as well as the percentage of requests exhibiting the respective

amounts of new data on a scale unfeasible for hu-
man annotation, it can also enable a detailed anal-
ysis of the relation between politeness and social
factors (Section 5).
Task setup To evaluate the robustness and
domain-independence of the analysis from Sec-
tion 3, we run our prediction experiments on two
very different domains. We treat Wikipedia as a
?development domain? since we used it for de-
veloping and identifying features and for training
our models. Stack Exchange is our ?test domain?
since it was not used for identifying features. We
take the model (features and weights) trained on
Wikipedia and use them to classify requests from
Stack Exchange.
We consider two classes of requests: polite
and impolite, defined as the top and, respectively,
bottom quartile of requests when sorted by their
politeness score (based on the binary notion of
politeness discussed in Section 2). The classes
are therefore balanced, with each class consisting
of 1,089 requests for the Wikipedia domain and
1,651 requests for the Stack Exchange domain.
We compare two classifiers ? a bag of words
classifier (BOW) and a linguistically informed
classifier (Ling.) ? and use human labelers as a
reference point. The BOW classifier is an SVM
using a unigram feature representation.6 We con-
sider this to be a strong baseline for this new

classification task, especially considering the large
amount of training data available. The linguisti-
cally informed classifier (Ling.) is an SVM using
the linguistic features listed in Table 3 in addition
to the unigram features. Finally, to obtain a ref-
erence point for the prediction task we also collect
three new politeness annotations for each of the re-
quests in our dataset using the same methodology
described in Section 2. We then calculate human
performance on the task (Human) as the percent-
age of requests for which the average score from
the additional annotations matches the binary po-
liteness class of the original annotations (e.g., a
positive score corresponds to the polite class).
Classification results We evaluate the classi-
fiers both in an in-domain setting, with a standard
leave-one-out cross validation procedure, and in a
cross-domain setting, where we train on one do-
main and test on the other (Table 4). For both our
development and our test domains, and in both the
in-domain and cross-domain settings, the linguis-
tically informed features give 3-4% absolute im-
provement over the bag of words model. While
the in-domain results are within 3% of human per-
formance, the greater room for improvement in the
cross-domain setting motivates further research on
linguistic cues of politeness.
The experiments in this section confirm that
our theory-inspired features are indeed effective in
practice, and generalize well to new domains. In
the next section we exploit this insight to automat-
ically annotate a much larger set of requests (about
400,000) with politeness labels, enabling us to re-
late politeness to several social variables and out-
comes. For new requests, we use class probabil-
ity estimates obtained by fitting a logistic regres-
sion model to the output of the SVM (Witten and
Frank, 2005) as predicted politeness scores (with
values between 0 and 1; henceforth politeness, by
abuse of language).
5 Relation to social factors
We now apply our framework to studying the rela-
tionship between politeness and social variables,
focussing on social power dynamics. Encour-
aged by the close-to-human performance of our
in-domain classifiers, we use them to assign po-
liteness labels to our full dataset and then compare
these labels to independent measures of power and
status in our data. The results closely match those
obtained with human-labeled data alone, thereby

supporting the use of computational methods to
pursue questions about social variables.
5.1 Relation to social outcome
Earlier, we characterized politeness markings as
currency used to pay respect. Such language is
therefore costly in a social sense, and, relatedly,
tends to incur costs in terms of communicative ef-
ficiency (Van Rooy, 2003). Are these costs worth
paying? We now address this question by studying
politeness in the context of the electoral system of
the Wikipedia community of editors.
Among Wikipedia editors, status is a salient so-
cial variable (Anderson et al, 2012). Administra-
tors (admins) are editors who have been granted
certain rights, including the ability to block other
editors and to protect or delete articles.7 Ad-
mins have a higher status than common editors
(non-admins), and this distinction seems to be
widely acknowledged by the community (Burke
and Kraut, 2008b; Leskovec et al, 2010; Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al, 2012). Aspiring editors
become admins through public elections,8 so we
know when the status change from non-admin to
admins occurred and can study users? language
use in relation to that time.
To see whether politeness correlates with even-
tual high status, we compare, in Table 5, the po-
liteness levels of requests made by users who will
eventually succeed in becoming administrators
(Eventual status: Admins) with requests made by
users who are not admins (Non-admins).9 We ob-
serve that admins-to-be are significantly more po-

Table 5: Politeness and status. Editors who
will eventually become admins are more polite
than non-admins (p<0.001 according to a Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon U test) and than editors who
will eventually fail to become admins (p<0.001).
Out of their requests, 30% are rated in the top po-
liteness quartile (significantly more than the 25%
of a random sample; p<0.001 according to a bi-
nomial test). This analysis was conducted on 31k
requests (1.4k for Admins, 28.9k for Non-admins,
652 for Failed).
lite than non-admins. One might wonder whether
this merely reflects the fact that not all users aspire
to become admins, and those that do are more po-
lite. To address this, we also consider users who
ran for adminship but did not earn community ap-
proval (Eventual status: Failed). These users are
also significantly less polite than their successful
counterparts, indicating that politeness indeed cor-
relates with a positive social outcome here.
5.2 Politeness and power
We expect a rise in status to correlate with a de-
cline in politeness (as predicted by politeness the-
ory, and discussed in Section 1). The previous sec-
tion does not test this hypothesis, since all editors
compared in Table 5 had the same (non-admin)
status when writing the requests. However, our
data does provide three ways of testing this hy-
pothesis.
First, after the adminship elections, successful
editors get a boost in power by receiving admin
privileges. Figure 3 shows that this boost is mir-
rored by a significant decrease in politeness (blue,
diamond markers). Losing an election has the op-
posite effect on politeness (red, circle markers),
perhaps as a consequence of reinforced low status.
Second, Stack Exchange allows us to test more
situational power effects.10 On the site, users re-
quest, from the community, information they are
lacking. This informational asymmetry between
the question-asker and his audience puts him at

subcommunity of Stack Exchange, namely Stack Overflow.

a social disadvantage. We therefore expect the
question-asker to be more polite than the people
who respond. Table 6 shows that this expectation
is born out: comments posted to a thread by the
original question-asker are more polite than those
posted by other users.

(106k for question-askers, 75k for answer-givers).
Third, Stack Exchange allows us to examine
power in the form of authority, through the com-
munity?s reputation system. Again, we see a neg-
ative correlation between politeness and power,
even after controlling for the role of the user mak-
ing the requests (i.e., Question-asker or Answer-
giver). Table 7 summarizes the results.11
Human validation The above analyses are
based on predicted politeness from our classifier.
This allows us to use the entire request data cor-

pus to test our hypotheses and to apply precise
controls to our experiments (such as restricting
our analysis to question-askers in the reputation
experiment). In order to validate this methodol-
ogy, we turned again to human annotation: we
collected additional politeness annotation for the
types of requests involved in the newly designed
experiments. When we re-ran our experiments on
human-labeled data alone we obtained the same
qualitative results, with statistical significance al-
ways lower than 0.01.12
Prediction-based interactions The human val-
idation of classifier-based results suggests that
our prediction framework can be used to explore
differences in politeness levels across factors of
interest, such as communities, geographical re-
gions and gender, even where gathering suffi-
cient human-annotated data is infeasible. We
mention just a few such preliminary results here:
(i) Wikipedians from the U.S. Midwest are most
polite (when compared to other census-defined
regions), (ii) female Wikipedians are generally
more polite (consistent with prior studies in which
women are more polite in a variety of domains;
(Herring, 1994)), and (iii) programming language
communities on Stack Exchange vary significantly
by politeness (Table 8; full disclosure: our analy-
ses were conducted in Python).

Politeness has been a central concern of modern
pragmatic theory since its inception (Grice, 1975;
Lakoff, 1973; Lakoff, 1977; Leech, 1983; Brown
and Levinson, 1978), because it is a source of
pragmatic enrichment, social meaning, and cul-
tural variation (Harada, 1976; Matsumoto, 1988;
12However, due to the limited size of the human-labeled
data, we could not control for the role of the user in the Stack
Exchange reputation experiment.

Ide, 1989; Blum-Kulka and Kasper, 1990; Blum-
Kulka, 2003; Watts, 2003; Byon, 2006). The start-
ing point for most research is the theory of Brown
and Levinson (1987). Aspects of this theory
have been explored from game-theoretic perspec-
tives (Van Rooy, 2003) and implemented in lan-
guage generation systems for interactive narratives
(Walker et al, 1997), cooking instructions, (Gupta
et al, 2007), translation (Faruqui and Pado, 2012),
spoken dialog (Wang et al, 2012), and subjectivity
analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012), among
others.
In recent years, politeness has been studied in
online settings. Researchers have identified vari-
ation in politeness marking across different con-
texts and media types (Herring, 1994; Brennan
and Ohaeri, 1999; Duthler, 2006) and between
different social groups (Burke and Kraut, 2008a).
The present paper pursues similar goals using or-
ders of magnitude more data, which facilitates a
fuller survey of different politeness strategies.
Politeness marking is one aspect of the broader
issue of how language relates to power and status,
which has been studied in the context of workplace
discourse (Bramsen et al, ; Diehl et al, 2007;
Peterson et al, 2011; Prabhakaran et al, 2012;
Gilbert, 2012; McCallum et al, 2007) and so-
cial networking (Scholand et al, 2010). However,
this research focusses on domain-specific textual
cues, whereas the present work seeks to lever-
age domain-independent politeness cues, build-
ing on the literature on how politeness affects
worksplace social dynamics and power structures
(Gyasi Obeng, 1997; Chilton, 1990; Andersson
and Pearson, 1999; Rogers and Lee-Wong, 2003;
Holmes and Stubbe, 2005). Burke and Kraut
(2008b) study the question of how and why spe-
cific individuals rise to administrative positions
on Wikipedia, and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al
(2012) show that power differences on Wikipedia
257
are revealed through aspects of linguistic accom-
modation. The present paper complements this
work by revealing the role of politeness in social
outcomes and power relations.
7 Conclusion
We construct and release a large collection of
politeness-annotated requests and use it to evalu-
ate key aspects of politeness theory. We build a
politeness classifier that achieves near-human per-
formance and use it to explore the relation between
politeness and social factors such as power, status,
gender, and community membership. We hope the
publicly available collection of annotated requests
enables further study of politeness and its relation
to social factors, as this paper has only begun to
explore this area.
