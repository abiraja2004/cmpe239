\]~e describe the linguistic background of 
a Czech-to-Russian ~T system, stressing its 
features result ing from the closed related- 
ness of the two languages, above all the pos- 
sibil ity of a minimization of the transfer. 
Related linguistic problems are analyzed 
within the MT project, as well as in the 
perspective of contrastive linguistics. 
1. The system of Czech-to-Russian MT 
system called RUSLAN is conceived ruimilarly 
as all l inguistical ly based MT systems) as a 
modular system consisting (in brief) of a 
source language parser, a tranfer and a syn- 
thesis of the target language. The task is to 
translate texts from the domain of computers, 
in particular manuals of operating systems. 
Since in RUSLAN the source language is close- 
ly genetical ly related to the target one, 
some of the modules of the system could have 
been considerably simplified, not leaving out 
of consi4eration the theoretical l inguistic 
framework on which t\]~e system is based (de- 
pendency and stratif icatlonal approach). The 
simplif ications concern, first of all, the 
transfer phase, so that the system cannot be 
understood as including a complete transfer. 
2. The effort towards a maximally effec- 
tive procedure has also resulted in s impl i f i -  
cations in the 2arser. This was made possible 
i.a. by the similarity of cases of syntactic 
ambiguity in the source and the target lan- 
guage. For example, with sequences of the 
type Verb Noun I Noun 2 ... Nouni, where each 
Nounj stands for a nominal or a preposit ional 
group serving as a free modifier, the surface 
order can general ly be preserved, which fact 
makes unnecessary a detailed identi f icat ion 
whether any of the Noun~'s modif ies the Verb 
or one of the precedin~ Nouns. This can be 
i l lustrated by the output Russian sentence 
"Vo vremja svoej raboty programma mo~et po- 
trebovat' tak~e pomo~6" sistemy pri obrabotke 
failer dannych." (Lit. "In course of-lts work 
program can need also help of-system in pro- 
cessing of-fi les of-data."), where the group 
"pri obrabotke ..." can be analyzed (in both 
languages) as modifying the verb "potrebovat "' 
or the nouns "pomo~5"" or "sistemy". If the 
order of the nominal groups is preserved, the 
translation also preserves the structural 
ambiguity of the original. Also nominal lza- 
tions can be translated independently of 
their underlying structure (e.g. , "Indeksno- 
posledovaternyje faJly neobchodimo do obra- 
botki preobrazovat'." - llt. " Index-sequential 
files have-to-be before ~rocessi__~ transfor- 
med.", or  "P rogrammy,  napisannye na Jazyke 
Assembler v ramkach pred\[du~6e~ versi i ,  ne- 
obchodimo snova translirovat'." - lit. "Pro- 
grams written in language Assembler in frame- 
work-of ~ version have-to-be again 
compiled."). 
Such an approach made it possible, at 
first, to minimize the transfer phase in the 
design of the project, and then, in the pro- 
cess of realization, the articu\].ation of 
transfer operations into the pax'ser and the 
synthesis, which may lead to an impressio~ 
that  RUSLAN works  complete \ ] .y  without  
transfer, i.e., as a direst binary NT system? 
In principle, it can be said that the minim:\[- 
zation of the transfer reflects the empirical 
fast that the two languages have a lot el ~ 
common features. 
3. A great role is played in RUSLAN by 
the lexicon. The lexical entry contains maxi -~ 
mum of information, which is then projected 
to the syntactic rules; only the most general 
behaviour of words is rendered purely by 
means of syntax. 
The rules of choice of lexical equiva- 
lents include different types of information? 
Along with the data on parts of speech and 
morphemics, semantic features are listed, and 
(esp. with verbs) also the valency (subcate- 
gorization) frame; the valency slots are ac.-- 
companled by information on their Czech mor- 
phemic form as well as that of the corres- 
ponding Russian items (as an example of their 
discrepancy might serve the pair "u~ivat 
n~co(acc.)" vs. "po~zovat~Ja ~em(instr?)" -- 
"to use stg." ). Where pasivization is possi~ 
ble, it is indicated which of the slots 
(mostly, but not always expressed by aecusa-~ 
tire) is selected as the passive surface sub- 
Ject, expressed then by nominative. With each 
of the slots, the semantic features required 
or excluded for the filler of that slot are 
indicated. These features help to identify 
the fi l lers, especial ly in cases of ambigui ~ 
ty, e.g. in Czech "V~stupnl za~izenl nastavi 
~,dkov&nl na po~adovanou hodnotu." (lito 
"Output device sets l ine-spaclng at required 
value ") the verb "nastavit" ("set") has the 
fol lowing valency frame: Actor (nom/nom~ 
+Human ,+Device) , Objective (ace/ace ,~-Con- 
cr,+Result-of-process,-}luman), where "+ de ~ 
notes semantic features such that at least 
one of them has to be prescott with the filler 
of the respective slot, " " denotes semantic 
features excluded with the fil ler, and bold- 
print denotes Czech/Russian morphological 
forms. In this way, the ambiguity of morphe- 
mic case with "~&dkov~ni" and "za~Izeni" (in 
both cases between non and ace) can be solved 
on the basis of semantic features of the "two 
nouns .  
3.1 The choice of the Russian equivalents 
for Czech lexical units should reflect also

repo lnen ie"  (correct ly)  an8 " d isketa" (in-- 
stead of "glbki j  d isk" ) ,  respect ive ly?  
This procedure , and a set of s imi lar  
f~%il-so ft rules for syntax , should ensure 
that the output be bas ica l ly  undel's%anda.ble. 
/4. The procedures of synt ac tie ana\] ysis 
and synthes is  are based on lexical  ini'ormat ~ 
ion, inc luding the va lency frameso Certa in

which the forms of a g iven adverbia l  type are

somewhere") :  "napravo" ("%o the rip;hi" , ad-  
verb) ~ "k problgmu" ("to the problem" ~ prepo-- 
s i t ion "k" + ds/tive) , "do bytu" ("into -the 
f lat" , p repos i t ion  "do 'I -l- accusa%J, ve) etc. 
Snch cases are handled by the parser tog-ether 
with free adverb ia ls ,  only i t  must be ensured 
that the ob l igatory  modi f ier  is ident i f ied 
(in a case of e l l ips is ,  it is necessary  %o 
take into account  the preceding" sentence 
a l though often the Czech de let ion goes in 
para l le l  with that in the cor respond ing  Rus-- 
sian sentence).  
4.fl One of the re levant  d i f ferences  be . 
tween Czech and Russ ian  syntax concerns sent-  
ences with the Czech Ist person plural co: .... 
responding to the Russ ian ref lex ive form~:~ 
e .g. Czech "A lgor i tmus re zm is t~ovf)n i b I o\]c?~ 
popisujeme v ~st J  6" vs. }{ussian "Al?;orJ.tm 
razme~enl ja  b lokov  opJ. syvaets j s  v razde le  6" 
("The a lgor i thm of d is locat ion  of blocks Js 
descr ibed in Sects 6"). Often a modal e~.-- 
press ion is present: "NAzvy progz'am~ m~erne 
mayn't v kn ihovn~ I' vs. Russ ian "}!azvanija pro.-- 
gramm me\[no naj%i v bibl ioteke" ("The t i t les 
of the programs can be found in the l ibra-  
ry") o The l inguist ic  rules under ly ing  the 
pract ica l  so lut ion of these problems can have  
%he fo l lowing form: 
NeUnacc VerblstP\]  -~ N?unnom Verbre f \ ]  
(N?unacc)  Verbmodal  ,IstPl Verb inf  
~-~ (NOUnno m ) Modal V er bin i:' 
("~'Todal" stands here for sueb express:ions as 
"mo~no" ("poss ib le")  , "nado" ("nec ~s~arv"); 
parentheses " (" ,')" denote the facb that -the 
Object ive  is not a lways obl igatory.  
4.2 In some cases the ambig'uity of a Czech 
sentence cor responds  to a s imJ . \ ] .ar  ambigu i ty  
in Russian.  In other cases the ambip;uity in 
the two languages is not in such accord;.tnce? 
This is i l lust rated by the fell. owing: 
a. Czech: 
V 16t@ prob~.h\].o jedngn5 o n ozv~ ! v az'J=aT!'j\[ ~ .0~!o 
Russ ian : 
\]:,etom pro~lo  sove~,an i je  .o ~!ovj)jr 2 v?t r : iante  OS~ 
(In summer~ the negot ia t ions  on the new va--. 
r iant of OS took place?)  
be Czech: 
V 16t@ prob~hlo jednAnl o. p-rf-tz__dn=i_nA?j!o 
Russian : 
Letom sove~ganie pre~Io vo v remja  k aj!.~Lk\]~I o 
(In summer , the negot ia t ions  took place 
dur ing vaca~ions.  ) 
47 
The preposit ion "o" with locative in Czech is 
kept also in Russian or, with nouns having 
the feature Time, translated as "vo vremja" 
with genitive. 
Differences in preposit ional construct-  
ions are found also with the fol lowing pairs: 
c. Czech: 
Price n_~a programu pokrabuj l  i v tomto roce. 
Russian: 
Raboty nad programmoj prodol~ajuts ja i v f, tom 
godu.  
(The works on the program continue also this 
year. ) 
d.  Czech: 
Prhee na fakult~ pokra~uj~ i v %omto rote. 
Russian: 
Raboty na faku~tete prodol~ajuts ja i v 6tom 
godu. 
(The works at the faculty continue also this 
year.) 
These examples cannot be fully accounted for 
by means of lexieal information, neither can 
they be included into the general scheme of 
syntactic rules. It is necessary to have a 
list of such differences. 
4.3 In translat ing Czech subordinate 
clauses introduced by such conjunctions as 
"zda" ,"-li" ("whether") , " jestl i~e" ("if") , 
"kdy~" ("when"), "dokud" ("ti l l"), "dokud he" 
("until") , "pokud" ("as long as") , some of 
which are ambiguous, the text can be treated 
as relat ively homogenous. The functioning of 
a clause introduced by "zda" or "-li" as a 
subject can be identif ied on the basis of the 
valency of the verb in superordinated clause, 
where it is marked whether the verb may take 
a subordinated clause as its Actor or Objec-  
tive. In the other cases, suitable or at 
least acceptable translat ions of the conjunc- 
tions are as follows: Czech "zda"," - l i " ,"po-  
kud" ,"jestli~e" as Russian "esli"; Czech "do- 
kud" ,"dokud he" as Russian "poka","poka ne" , 
Czech "kdy~" as Russian "kogda". 
It follows that while it is necessary 
to work "to a certain degreewith the under - 
lying structure, in'the major i ty of cases the 
equivalent can be chosen just in accordance 
with the conjunct ions themselves. 
4.4 The Czech verb "btt" ("to be") has 
several Russian equivalents: the copula 
"byt TM , verbs "est TM , " javl jat~Ja",  "naehodit u 
sja", "imet~ja". The select ion of the equiva- 
lent depends on the syntactic context: if the 
nominal predicate in Czech is in instrumental 
ease, then a form of the verb " javl jat~ja" is 
preferred; if a local adverbial is present,  
then the translat ion "nachodit~ja" is at pla- 
ce, otherwise the appropriate form of the 
copula is chosen; Of course, another point 
concerns the translat ion of "btt" within 
idioms ("byt'v porjadke", but "imet~ja v ras- 
porja~enii").  
4.5 The surface behaviour of negat ion is 
not the same in Czech and Jn Russian: in 
Czech, even partial negation is often expres- 
sed as a prefix of the verb, which gives rise 
to an ambiguity absent in Russian, where %hls 
dist inct ion is always transparent. Some of 
the examples from our texts are: 
ao Czech: 
To ant system p~esn~ nev~. 
Russian: 
~togo da~e sistema to,no ne znaet. 
(Th~s even the system does not know exactly?) 
b. Czech: 
Tabu lka  nen~ u lo~cna na pevn6m m~st~ v 
pam6ti. 
Russian: 
Tahl ica pome~aets ja  ne na postojannom meste 
v pamjati. 
(The matrix is not placed in a fixed posit ion 
in the stbrage.) 
4.6 We assume that the surface order is 
substant ial ly the same in the two languages; 
the dif ferences concern only such specific 
cases as, e.g., the positions of parts of the 
complex verb forms or those of certain pro~- 
nouns and particles which have the character 
of el it ics in Czech, but usual ly fol low the 
verb in Russian: 
a .  Czech: 
... vypadal by tak, ~e ~ tabulka obsahovala 
fldaje ... 
Russian: 
... vygl jadel by tak, 5to tabl ica soder{ala 
~Z dannye ... 
(... he would look as if the matrix con-- 
tained(eond.)  data ...) 
b. Czech: 
Budeme se v opera~n~ch syst6mech sna~it ... 
Russian: 
V operacionnych sistemach budem s~aratsb/a~,' ' ' .. . 
(In the operating systeme~ we shall try ...) 
The dif ferences described in this section do 
not concern the structural order, and there 
is no danger that ambiguity might arise. The 
dis location of function words and particles 
can be described by general rules. 
4.7 In 4.1 through 4.6 we wanted to show 
what the problems of parsing are if the cor~ 
respondences in the underlying structure, in 
surface syntax and in the surface order of 
morphemes are to be made use of, while the 
dif ferences are solved; we also wanted to il~ 
lustrate the narrowed, but nonetheless neces-- 
sary role of transfer. 
5. We wanted to point out that, on the one 
hand, the closeness of the two languages 
makes it relat ively easy to find a strategy 
for an MT system, since the most complex pro- 
blems of ambiguit ies might be part ia l ly a- 
voided, although, on the other hand, compara-  
tive empirical research in the domains of 
lexicon and of syntax is necessary also for 
such a pair of languages. Results of such an 
approach may be useful in MT, and also in the 
context of a contrastive comparison of cog- 
nate languages.
