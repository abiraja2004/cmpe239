2.2. MTD-X IANTONG 
MTD-XIANTONG is the MTD version of 
The Modern Chinese Diclionary af General Chinese 
Characters (Fu, 1997). XIANTONG ix lhe shortened 
name for tht: original Chinese dit:titmaty, it contains 
abont 10,000 monosylhtbic Chinese words in the fo:m 
of t:haraetcrs with more than 50,000 muhisyl labic 
Chinese words and phrases as examples. The meanings 
of eve D' monosyllable Chinese word are det'incd in the 
sense definit ions given under the entry word in 
qncstion. However, the mtfltisyllabie words and phrases 
given as examples following each word sense definition 
do not have accompanying definitions. Each word sense 
definilion is separated irom its examples by a colon. 
An example is given bt:low: 
, 1o I I 
3o I 
40 
The construct ion of MTD-X iANTONG 
proceeds in two steps. At Step I. more than 50,000 
mult isyl labie example words  and phrases are 
automatically sense tagged. At Step 2 the definition 
text of every word sense of all head words are 
disambiguatcd, attaching a sense nunaber to every word 
in the sense definitions. Note that the MTD version of 
XIANTONG conlains entries of words in frequent use 
only. Mon,,)syllabic Chint:se words that are not in 
frequent use (2,193 of them) stay out of MTD- 
XIANTONG. Word sense cntrics in MTD-XIANTONG 
total around 15,0(X) with about 50,000 examples of 
compound words and phrases. All words in the 
definition texts and all exanlples are taggccd with wt)rd 
sense numbers. 
The algorithm used in automatically sense 
tagging the nmltisyllabic words in XIANTONG is 
fairly, simple. It takes advantage of one important fact 
ctmct:rning the making of tht: ol iginul Chinest: 
dictionary, i.e., repeated appearance of the same example 
word and phrase under diflk:rent head words, or morn 
exactly, under different sense definitions of different 
head words. In fact, all head words in XIANTONG are 
single Chinese characters. For e, xample a bisyllabic 
Chinese word made up of two Chinese characters may 
appear twice as an example under the two composite 
characters, each time as an exmnple of a particular word 
sense of one o\[ the two vharaetcrs being defined. For 
example, tile wt)ld ~. ,~ .  0ecover) appears under both 
,g~ and ~ , )~._  appears under ~ as an example 
m Sense 1 (p.275). and under ~__ as an example in 
Sense 1 (p. 151), t~x~. Hence .,~ A01 '~t~_A()I. By 
checking through all example words and phrases in the 
way they arc cross-referrt:d, all words that art: t:ross- 
referred as examples in the dictionary are automatically 
tagged with appropriate sense numbers. This process 
pr?xluced the bulk of MTD entries which form the core 
of the reasoning system in the atttomatic sense tagging 
of running Chmest: text (Tong, ct al., 1993). 
At Step 2 the antomatic tagging of sense 
numbers to each word in the definition text proceeds in 
the ~me way as described in Tong, et al (1993). 
Efforts are now being made to blend in human 
judgement to the making el  a m(ne accurate version of 
MTD-XIANTONG.

3. Evolution from Type t to Type n MtTDs 
The absolnle advanlage l  Type II MTI)s over 
Type I MTI)s is an empirical question. However, the 
advantage of a descriptive set of semantic primitives 
over a set of definition primiiivcs derived from ont:

Desirably, a descriptive sel of semantic nri n I yes ix free

Karen Sparck-Jones(1967) conducted an in-depth stndy 
on circular definitions in ttnglish dictionzuies. Similal
