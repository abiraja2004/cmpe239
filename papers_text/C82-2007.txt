Ident i fy ing  the re ferent  of a s ingu lar  de f in i te  term in  
a database query essent ia l l y  cons is ts  in  detemin ing  i t s  
extens ion  in  the database by app ly ing  the Ruass l l i an  t ru th  
cond i t ions  fo r  de f in i te  descr ip t ions .  However, most de f in i te  
descr ip t ions  are " incomplete"  in  that  the descr ip t ion  i t se l f  
does not conta in  the un ique ly  spec i fy ing  cond i t ions  but i t  
should be au~nented by features  der ived  from the s i tuat ion  or 
d i scourse  context .  Most work in  AI in  th i s  f ie ld  has con-  
cent ra ted  on how to de l imi t  the re levant  contextua l  features  
(see,  fo r  example, the work on anapho~o re ference  and focus -  
s ing  by Webber 78, S idner  77 and Grosz 76) .  This paper 
addresses  cer ta in  aspects  of the theory  of de f in i te  re ference  
which, though extens ive ly  t reated  in  the l i te ra ture  on lan -  
guage phi losophy,  have been ra ther  neg lec ted  in  the des ign  
of natura l  language process ing  systemae. 
Some of the ambigu i t ies  of de f in i te  re ference  der ive  
from the fac t  that  a de f in i te  descr ip t ion  may denote some 
unique ind iv idua l  in  the world sa t i s fy ing  the spec i f i ca t ion  
or  some ind iv idua l  the speaker has in  mind who may or may not 
co inc ide  wi th  the former ( ie  the " re ferent ia l "  versus  the 
, ,a t t r ib~t ive  n mode of re fe rence) .  Furthelqnore~ the speaker 
may in tend  the hearer  to in terpret  the rs fe~c l~ express ion  
in  e i ther  a "value laden" or a "value f ree"  mode (c f r  Ba~- 
wiee/Psx-~y 80) .  In  the former mode the sentence  i s  g iven

a secondary in terpretat ion  by subst i tu t in~ in  i t  the ent i ty  
fu l f i l l i ng  the descr ip t ion .  This ra i ses  such i ssues  as to 
whether de f in i te  descr ip t ions  may be used to inform as we l l  
as to refer (see Joshi 78). The first part of the paper 
at tempts  to character i ze  the phenomena var ious ly  re fer red  to 
by such terms as in tens ion /extenston ,  de d i t to /de  re ,  
attrlbutlve/referentlal, value-free~value-laden... Some of 
these phenomena re to be accounted fo r  on the semantic  
leve l  of representat ion  whereas others  are deemed to  belong 
to the pra~nat ic  leve l ,  
The second par t  of the paper examines which of the 
modes of de f in i te  re ference  d i s t ingu ished  in  paz~t I are 
man i fes ted  in  the in teract ion  with a database system and how 
they can be recognized by the natuxa l  language in ter face .  The 
s tandard  procedure fo r  de f in i te  re ference  ident i f i ca t ion  i s  
to exclude gener ic  and " in tens iona l "  uses;  to assume ident i ty  
between the re ferent  the speaker be l ieves  fu l f i l l s  the 
descr ip t ion  and the ac tua l  re fe rent  and to un i formly  impose 
a va lue - laden  in terpretat ion  mode, The fo l low ing  examples 
i l l us t ra te  some other  modes of re fe rence  which should rece ive  
adequate t reatment  in  a natura l  language in ter face  extend ing  
i t s  cap ic i ty  beyond the mere re t r ieva l  of fac tua l  in fo rmat -  
ion .  
The gener ic  mode of re fe rence  i s  not always obv ious ly  
d i s t ingu ishab le  from the a t t r ibut ive  mode as shown by (1) 
and (2), reepectlvely~ 
(1) How long is the flight from Boston to Chicago? 
(2) How many passengers were on the flight from 
Boston to Chicago? 
The semant ic  in terpreta t ion  of the de f in i te  a r t i c le  in  
(1) corresponds to the un iversa l  quant i f ie r  whereas Xn (2) 
i t  corresponds to the io ta -operator .  In  cont ras t  to the gen-  
e r i c  mode, a de f in i te  descr ip t ion  i s  used " in tena iona l ly"  
when the subst i tu t ion  of i t s  extens ion  in  ~he sentence may 
a l te r  the t ru th  va lue .  This i s  the case in  re ferent ia l l y

opaque contexts. It hss been pointed out by Kaplan/Davidson 
81 that  cer ta in  update commands uch as (3) may be re ferent -  
ia l l y  opaque: 
(3) Change the teacher of CIS 234 to Dr. Smith. 
The difference between the attributive and the referent- 
ial uses, on the other hand, may be illustrated by the differ- 
ent replies (4a) end (4b), respectively, to query (4): 
(4) Is there a car parked under the big cherry tree? 
(4a) No. There is no cherry tree in the scene. 
(4b) Yes. But the tree you are referring to is an oak. 
In the referential mode of reference the hearer has an 
independent way of identifying the referent, usually through 
locating him in time and space. In this mode the description 
serves a dual function of referring and of describing. The 
referential mode is only likely to occur when interacting 
with a database consisting of visual objects displayed on a 
screen (as in the SRI and HAM-RPM projects). In the attribut- 
ive mode the description refers to whichever entity fulfills 
the specification at a particular index. The referential/ 
/attributive distinction is not to be explained as a scope 
ambigu i ty  (c f r  the re /de  d i t to  readings) but ra ther  both 
read ings  should rece ive  the same semantic  in terpreta t ion ,  the 
d i s t inc t ion  being accounted fo r  on the pragmatic leve l  (see 
fu r ther ) .  
Of particular importance to natural language interaction 
in a system that ales at a high degree of "cooperativeness" 
is the distinction between the value-free and value-laden 
interpretation modes, from the point of view of the hearer. 
Consider the following alternative system replies (Sa) and 
(5h) to query (5). In (Sa) the definite description was 
value-laden, as is the standard practice, whereas the value- 
-free interpretation indicated by (Sb) seems to be more 
appropriate to the user's intentions:

(5 )  U: Does the head of the CIS department earn more 
then the head of the Phi losophy department? 
S: Yes 
U: Why? 
(5a) S: Because Dr. Jones has more dependents than 
Dr. Smith 
(Sb) S: Because computer sc ience  i s  bet te r  remunerated 
than ph i losophy ?
In  order  to re t r ieve  the answer the extens ion  of  the 
descr ip t ion  has to be determined in  both cases but in  (Sb) 
the ingred ients  of  the descr ip t ive  express ion  were re ta ined  
for further processing. This raises such pragmatic issues as 
why a speaker  chooses a par t i cu la r  descr ip t ion  to  re fe r  to  an 
ent i ty  and what c lues  might guide the hearer  as to the in -  
tended in terpreta t ion  s t ra tbgy .  
The th i rd  par t  of  the paper g ives  an out l ine  on how to 
in terpret  these modes in  the system. The approach taken i s  
that  cer ta in  modes should be t reated  as pra~at io  phencaema 
ra ther  than as semantic  ones.  A t the  semantic  leve l  a language 
process ing  system should produce a context - independent  in ter -  
p re ta t ion  of  what a speaker  means by an u t te rance .  The prag-  
mat ic  leve l  dea ls  wi th  what the speaker  Intends the hearer  to  
imfer  from h is  u t te rance .  At the semantic  leve l  of  representat -  
ion the Russe l l i an  t ru th  cond i t ions  fo r  de f in i te  re fe rence  are  
app l ied ,  where appropr ia te .  These determine the "semant ic  
re fe rent"  which i s  de f ined  by the convent ions  of  the language;  
the "speaker ' s  re fe rent" ,  on the o ther  hand, i s  the ob jec t  
which the speaker  be l ieves  fu l f i l l s  the cond i t ions  fo r  being 
the semantic re fe rent  (see Kripke 77).  This paper a t tempts  to  
spec i fy  the not ion  of  "speaker ' s  re fe rent"  in  terms of  re fe r -  
ence as a speech ac t .  For example, a cond i t ion  fo r  fe l i c i tous  
re fe rence  in  the re ferent ia l  mode i s  that  the speaker  be l ieves  
that  the re ferent  sa t i s f ies  the descr ip t ion  and a l so  that  he 
be l ieves  the hearer  be l ieves  In  the " Jus t i f i ca t ion"  fo r  the 
descr ip t ion  (cf~ Cohen/Per rau l t  81) .  I t  wa l l  be shown that  in
