Abstract
In this paper, we present a system that au-
tomatically generates questions from natural
language text using discourse connectives. We
explore the usefulness of the discourse con-
nectives for Question Generation (QG) that
looks at the problem beyond sentence level.
Our work divides the QG task into content se-
lection and question formation. Content se-
lection consists of finding the relevant part in
text to frame question from while question for-
mation involves sense disambiguation of the
discourse connectives, identification of ques-
tion type and applying syntactic transforma-
tions on the content. The system is evaluated
manually for syntactic and semantic correct-
ness.
1 Introduction
Automatic QG from sentences and paragraphs has
caught the attention of the NLP community in the
last few years through the question generation work-
shops and the shared task in 2010 (QGSTEC, 2010).
Previous work in this area has concentrated on gen-
erating questions from individual sentences (Varga
and Ha, 2010; Paland et al, 2010; Ali et al, 2010).
Sneiders and E. (2002) used question templates and
Heilman et al (2009) used general-purpose rules
to transform sentences into questions. A notable
exception is Mannem et al (2010) who generated
questions of various scopes (general, medium and
specific) ? 1 from paragraphs instead of individual
?First two authors contributed equally to this work
1General scope - entire or almost entire paragraph, Medium
scope - multiple clauses or sentences, and Specific scope - sen-
sentences. They boil down the QG from paragraphs
task into first identifying the sentences in the para-
graph with general, medium and specific scopes and
then generating the corresponding questions from
these sentences using semantic roles of predicates.
Discourse connectives play a vital role in mak-
ing the text coherent. They connect two clauses
or sentences exhibiting discourse relations such as
temporal, causal, elaboration, contrast, result,
etc. Discourse relations have been shown to be use-
ful to generate questions (Prasad and Joshi, 2008)
but identifying these relations in the text is a difficult
task (Pitler et al, 2009). So in this work, instead of
identifying discourse relations and generating ques-
tions using them, we explore the usefulness of dis-
course connectives for QG. We do this by analyzing
the senses of the connectives that help in QG and
propose a system that makes use of this analysis to
generate questions of the type why, when, give an
example and yes/no.
The two main problems in QG are identifying the
content to ask a question on and finding the corre-
sponding question type for that content. We ana-
lyze the connectives in terms of the content useful
for question generation based on the senses they ex-
hibit. We show that the senses of the connectives
further help in choosing the relevant question type
for the content.
In this paper, we present an end-to-end QG sys-
tem that takes a document as input and outputs all
the questions generated using the selected discourse
connectives. The system has been evaluated man-
ually by two evaluators for syntactic and semantic
tence or less

correctness of the generated questions. The over-
all system has been rated 6.3 out of 8 for QGSTEC
development dataset and 5.8 out of 8 for Wikipedia
dataset.
2 Overview
Question Generation involves two tasks, content
selection (the text selected for question generation)
and question formation (transformations on the con-
tent to get the question). Question formation further
has the subtasks of (i) finding suitable question type
(wh-word), (ii) auxiliary and main verb transforma-
tions and (iii) rearranging the phrases to get the final
question.
There are 100 distinct types of discourse connec-
tives listed in PDTB manual (PDTB, 2007). The
most frequent connectives in PDTB are and, or,
but, when, because, since, also, although, for
example, however and as a result. In this paper,
we provide analysis for four subordinating conjunc-
tions, since, when, because and although, and three
adverbials, for example, for instance and as a re-
sult. Connectives such as and, or and also show-
ing conjunction relation have not been found to
be good candidates for generating wh-type ques-
tions and hence have not been discussed in the pa-
per. Leaving aside and, or and also, the selected
connectives cover 52.05 per cent of the total number
of the connectives in QGSTEC-2010 2 dataset and
41.97 per cent in Wikipedia articles. Connective-
wise coverage in both the datasets is shown in Table
1. Though but and however denoting contrast re-
lation occur frequently in the data, it has not been
feasible to generate wh-questions using them.

identifies the sentences containing at least one of the
seven discourse connectives. In our approach, suit-
able content for each discourse connective which is
referred to as target argument is decided based on
the properties of discourse connective. The system
finds the question type on the basis of discourse re-
lation shown by discourse connective.
3 Discourse connectives for QG
In this section, we provide an analysis of dis-
course connectives with respect to their target argu-
ments and the question types they take.
3.1 Question type identification
The sense of the discourse connective influences
the question-type (Q-type). Since few discourse
connectives such as when, since and although
among the selected ones can show multiple senses,
the task of sense disambiguation of the connectives
is essential for finding the question type.
Since: The connective can show temporal, causal
or temporal + causal relation in a sentence. Sen-
tence exhibits temporal relation in presence of key-
words like time(7 am), year (1989 or 1980s), start,
begin, end, date(9/11), month (January) etc. If the
relation is temporal then the question-type is when
whereas in case of causal relation it would be why.
1. Single wicket has rarely been played since lim-
ited overs cricket began.
Q-type: when
2. Half-court games require less cardiovascular
stamina , since players need not run back and
forth a full court.
Q-type: why
In examples 1 and 2, 1 is identified to show tem-
poral relation because it has the keyword began
whereas there is no keyword in the context of ex-
ample 2 that gives the hint of temporal relation and
so the relation here is identified as causal.
When: Consider the sentences with connec-
tive when in Figure 1. Although when shows
multiple senses (temporal, temporal+causal and
conditional), we can frame questions by a single
question type, when. Given a new instance of
the connective, finding the correct sense of when

becomes unnecessary as a result of using discourse

Although: The connective can show concession
or contrast discourse relations. It is difficult to frame
a wh-question on contrast or concession relations.
So, system generates a yes/no type question for al-
though. Moreover, yes/no question-type adds to the
variety of questions generated by the system.
3. Greek colonies were not politically controlled
by their founding cities , although they often
retained religious and commercial links with
them .
Q-type: Yes/No
A yes/no question could have been asked for
connectives but and however denoting a contrast re-
lation but it was not done to preserve the question-
type variety in the final output of the QG system.
Y es/no questions have been asked for occurrences
of although since they occur less frequently than
but and however.
Identifying the question types for other selected
discourse connectives is straight forward because
they broadly show only one discourse relation
(Pitler and Nenkova, 2009). Based on the relations
exhibited by these connectives, Table 2 shows the
question types for each discourse connective.
3.2 Target arguments for discourse connectives
A discourse connective can realize its two argu-
ments, Arg1 and Arg2, structurally and anaphori-
cally. Arg2 is always realized structurally whereas
Arg1 can be either structural or anaphoric (PDTB,
2007; Prasad et al, 2010).
4. [Arg1 Organisms inherit the characteristics of
their parents] because [Arg2 the cells of the
offspring contain copies of the genes in their
parents? cells.](Intra-sentential connective be-
cause)
5. [Arg1 The scorers are directed by the hand sig-
nals of an umpire.] For example, [Arg2 the
umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the
batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises
both arms above his head if the batsman has
hit the ball for six runs.](Inter-sentential con-
nective for example)
Consider examples 4 and 5. In 4, Arg1 and Arg2
are the structural arguments of the connective be-
cause whereas in 5, Arg2 is the structural argument
and Arg1 is realized anaphorically.
The task of content selection involves finding the
target argument (either Arg1 or Arg2) of the dis-
course connective. Since both the arguments are po-
tential candidates for QG, we analyze the data to
identify which argument makes better content for
each of the connectives. Our system selects one of
the two arguments based on the properties of the dis-
course connectives. Table 3 shows the target argu-

ment i.e. either Arg1 or Arg2, which is used as con-
tent for QG.
4 Target Argument Identification
Target argument for a discourse connective can
be a clause(s) or a sentence(s). It could be one or
more sentences in case of inter-sentential3 discourse
connectives, whereas one or more clauses in case of
intra-sentential4 connectives.
Discourse connectives for example and for in-
stance can realize its Arg1 anywhere in the prior dis-
course (Elwell and Baldridge, 2008). So the system
considers only those sentences in which the connec-
tives occur at the beginning of the sentence and the
immediate previous sentence is assumed to be the
Arg1 of the connective (which is the target argument
for QG).
In case of intra-sentential connectives (because,
since, although and when) and as a result (target ar-
gument is Arg2 which would be a clause), identifi-
cation of target argument is done in two steps. The
system first locates the syntactic head or head verb
of the target argument and then extracts it from the
dependency tree of the sentence.
4.1 Locate syntactic head
Approach for locating the syntactic head of tar-
get argument is explained with the help of Figure 2
(generic dependency trees) and an example shown
in Figure 3. Syntactic head of Arg2 is the first fi-
nite verb while percolating up in the dependency tree
starting from the discourse connective. In case of
intra-sentential connectives where Arg1 is the target
argument, the system percolates up until it gets the
second finite verb which is assumed to be target head

of Arg1. Number of percolations entirely depend on
structure and complexity of the sentence. Figure 2
shows two dependency trees (a) and (b). Starting
from the discourse connective DC and percolating
up, the system identifies that the head of Arg2 is V2
and that of Arg1 is V1.

[Arg1 competitive badminton is played indoors].(content)
Figure 3: Question Generation process
Since the discourse connective in the example of
Figure 3 is because, the target argument is Arg1
(from Table 2). By percolating up the tree starting
from because, the head of Arg2 is affected and that
of Arg1 is played. Once we locate the head of the
target argument, we find the auxiliary as Mannem
et al (2010) does. For the example in Figure 3, the
auxiliary for question generation is is.
4.2 Target Argument Extraction
The extraction of the target argument is done af-
ter identifying its syntactic head. For as a result,
the target argument, Arg2, is the subtree with head

as the head of the connective. For intra-sentential
connectives, the target argument, Arg1, is the tree
remaining after removing the subtree that contains
Arg2.
In Figures 2 (a) and (b) both, a tree with head
V1 and its children, X and Z, is left after removing
Arg2 from dependency trees, which is the content
required for generating the question. Note that in the
tree of Figure 2(b), the child P of the head verb V1 is
removed with its entire subtree that contains Arg2.
Thus, subtree with head V2 is the unwanted part for
the tree in Figure 2(a) whereas subtree with head P
is the unwanted part for the tree in Figure 2(b) when
the target argument is Arg1.
In Figure 3, after removing the unwanted argu-
ment Arg2 (subtree with head affected), the system
gets competitive badminton is played indoors which
is the required clause (content) for question genera-
tion. The next section describes how the content is
transformed into a question.
5 Syntactic Transformations and Question
Generation
The syntactic transformations used in this work
are similar to those by Mannem et al (2010). At this
stage, the system has the question type, auxiliary and
the content. The following set of transformations
are applied on the content to get the final question.
(1) If the auxiliary is present in the sentence itself
then it is moved to the beginning of the sentence;
otherwise auxiliary is added at the beginning of the
sentence. (2) If a wh-question is to be formed, the
question word is added just before the auxiliary. In
case of Yes/No questions, the question starts with
the auxiliary itself as no question word is needed. (3)
A question-mark(?) is added at the end to complete
the question.
Consider the example in Figure 3. Here the con-
tent is competitive badminton is played indoors.
Applying the transformations, the auxiliary is first
moved at the start of the sentence to get is compet-
itive badminton played indoors. Then the question
type Why is added just before the auxiliary is, and
a question-mark is added at the end to get the final
question, Why is competitive badminton played in-
doors ?
Scope: In QGSTEC 2010 the question had to be
assigned a scope, specific, medium or general. The
scope is defined as: general - entire input paragraph,
medium - one or more clauses or sentences and spe-
cific - phrase or less. Questions generated using dis-
course connectives are usually of the scope specific
or medium. Mannem et al (2010) assigned medium
scope to the questions generated using the seman-
tic roles such as ARGM-DIS (result), ARGM-CAU
(causal) and ARGM-PNC (purpose) given by the
SRL. However, most of the times, the scope of the
answer to these questions is just a clause or a sen-
tence and should have been assigned specific scope
instead of medium.
6 Evaluation and Results
Automatic evaluation of any natural language
generated text is difficult. So, our system is eval-
uated manually. The evaluation was performed
by two graduate students with good English profi-
ciency. Evaluators were asked to rate the questions
on the scale of 1 to 4 (4 being the best score) on syn-
tactic and semantic correctness (Evalguide, 2010)
of the question and an overall rating on the scale of
8 (4+4) is assigned to each question.
The syntactic correctness is rated to ensure that
the system can generate grammatical output. In ad-
dition, those questions which read fluently are given
greater score. The syntactic correctness and fluency
is evaluated using the following scores: 4 - gram-

begin early in the morning and many of these students either choose to stay up awake late into
the night or cannot do otherwise due to delayed sleep phase syndrome. As a result, students
that should be getting between 8.5 and 9.25 hours of sleep are getting only 7 hours.

Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel much slower than the arm movement suggests.
For example, a good cross court sliced drop shot will use a hitting action that suggests a straight

the arm movement suggests. (Instantiation)

Table 5 shows questions generated by the system
for each connective. The results of our system on
QGSTEC-2010 development dataset are shown in
Table 6. The overall system is rated 6.3 out of 8 on
this dataset and the total number of questions gen-
erated for this dataset is 61. The instances of the
connectives were less in the QGSTEC-2010 devel-
opment dataset. So, the system is further tested on
five Wikipedia articles (football, cricket, basketball,
badminton and tennis) for effective evaluation. Re-
sults on this dataset are presented in Table 7. Overall
rating of the system is 5.8 out of 8 for this dataset
and 150 are the total number of questions generated
for this dataset. The ratings presented in the Tables 6
and 7 are the average of the ratings given by both the
evaluators. The inter-evaluator agreement (Cohen?s
kappa coefficient) for the QGSTEC-2010 develop-
6
ment dataset for syntactic correctness measure is 0.6
and is 0.5 for semantic correctness measure, and in
case of Wikipedia articles the agreement is 0.7 and
0.6 for syntactic and semantic correctness measures
respectively.

On analyzing the data, we found that the
Wikipedia articles have more complex sentences
(with unusual structure as well as more number of
clauses) than QGSTEC-2010 development dataset.
As a result, the system?s performance consistently
drops for all the connectives in case of Wikipedia
dataset.
No comparable evaluation was done as none of
the earlier works in QG exploited the discourse con-
nectives in text to generate questions.
7 Error Analysis
An error analysis was carried out on the system?s
output and the four most frequent types of errors are
discussed in this section.
7.1 Coreference resolution
The system doesn?t handle coreference resolution
and as a result of this, many questions have been
rated low for semantic correctness by the evalua-
tors. Greater the number of pronouns in the ques-
tion, lesser is the semantic rating of the question.
6. They grow in height when they reach shallower
water, in a wave shoaling process.
Question: When do they grow in height?
Although the above example 6 is syntactically
correct, such questions are rated semantically low
because the context is not sufficient to answer the
question due to the pronouns in it. 13.54% of
the generated questions on the Wikipedia dataset
have pronouns without their antecedents, making the
questions semantically insufficient.
7.2 Parsing Errors
Sometimes the parser fails to give a correct parse
for the sentences with complex structure. In such
cases, the system generates a question that is unac-
ceptable. Consider the examples below.
7. In a family who know that both parents are car-
riers of CF , either because they already have a
CF child or as a result of carrier testing , PND
allows the conversion of a probable risk of the
disease affecting an unborn child to nearer a
certainty that it will or will not be affected.
Question: Why do in a family who know that
both parents are carriers of CF , either or will
not be affected ?
In example 7 above, the sentence has a com-
plex structure containing paired connective, either-
or, where the argument of either has because and
that of or has as a result in it. Here the question is
formed using because which is correct neither syn-
tactically nor semantically due to the complex nature
of the sentence. 9.38% sentences in the datasets are
complex with either three or more discourse connec-
tives.
7.3 Errors due to the inter-sentential
connectives
For inter-sentential connectives, system considers
only those sentences in which the connectives occur
at the beginning of the sentence and the immediate
previous sentence is assumed to be the Arg1 of the
connective (which is the target argument for QG).
But this assumption is not always true. Of the total
number of instances of these connectives, 52.94%
(for Wikipedia dataset) connectives occur at the be-
ginning of the sentences. Consider the paragraph be-
low.
8. A game point occurs in tennis whenever the
7
player who is in the lead in the game needs only
one more point to win the game. The termi-
nology is extended to sets (set point), matches
(match point), and even championships (cham-
pionship point). For example, if the player who
is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has
a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the
player has three consecutive chances to win the
game.
Here in example 8, the third sentence in which the
example is specified is related to the first sentence
but not the immediately previous sentence. For these
connectives, the assumption that immediate previ-
ous sentence is Arg1 is false 14.29% of the times.
7.4 Fluency issues
The system does not handle the removal of pred-
icative adjuncts. So the questions with optional
phrases in it are rated low for syntactic correctness
measure.
8 Conclusions and Future Work
Our QG system generates questions using dis-
course connectives for different question types. In
this work, we present an end-to-end system that
takes a document as input and outputs all the ques-
tions for selected discourse connectives. The system
has been evaluated for syntactic and semantic sound-
ness of the question by two evaluators. We have
shown that some specific discourse relations are im-
portant such as causal, temporal and result than
others from the QG point of view. This work also
shows that discourse connectives are good enough
for QG and that there is no need for full fledged dis-
course parsing. In the near future, we plan to im-
plement coreference resolution and sentences with
more than two connectives. We aim to improve the
system with respect to the sentence complexity and
also incorporate other discourse connectives.
