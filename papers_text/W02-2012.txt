Abstract
This paper presents the ongoing project
Computational Models of First Language
Acquisition, together with its current
product, the learning algorithm GraSp.
GraSp is designed specifically for
inducing grammars from large, unlabelled
corpora of spontaneous (i.e. unscripted)
speech. The learning algorithm does not
assume a predefined grammatical
taxonomy; rather the determination of
categories and their relations is considered
as part of the learning task. While GraSp
learning can be used for a range of
practical tasks, the long-term goal of the
project is to contribute to the debate of
innate linguistic knowledge ? under the
hypothesis that there is no such.
Introduction
Most current models of grammar learning
assume a set of primitive linguistic categories
and constraints, the learning process being
modelled as category filling and rule
instantiation ? rather than category formation
and rule creation. Arguably, distributing
linguistic data over predefined categories and
templates does not qualify as grammar 'learning'
in the strictest sense, but is better described as
'adjustment' or  'adaptation'. Indeed, Chomsky,
the prime advocate of the hypothesis of innate
linguistic principles, has claimed that "in certain
fundamental respects we do not really learn
language" (Chomsky 1980: 134). As Chomsky
points out, the complexity of the learning task is
greatly reduced given a structure of primitive
linguistic constraints ("a highly restrictive
schematism", ibid.). It has however been very
hard to establish independently the
psychological reality of such a structure, and the
question of innateness is still far from settled.
While a decisive experiment may never be
conceived, the issue could be addressed
indirectly, e.g. by asking: Are innate principles
and parameters necessary preconditions for
grammar acquisition? Or rephrased in the spirit
of constructive logic: Can a learning algorithm
be devised that learns what the infant learns
without incorporating specific linguistic axioms?
The presentation of such an algorithm would
certainly undermine arguments referring to the
'poverty of the stimulus', showing the innateness
hypothesis to be dispensable.
This paper presents our first try.
1 The essential algorithm
1.1 Psycho-linguistic preconditions
Typical spontaneous speech is anything but
syntactically 'well-formed' in the Chomskyan
sense of the word.
right well let's er --= let's look at the applications
- erm - let me just ask initially this -- I discussed
it with er Reith er but we'll = have to go into it a
bit further - is it is it within our erm er = are we
free er to er draw up a rather = exiguous list - of
people to interview
(sample from the London-Lund corpus)
Yet informal speech is not perceived as being
disorderly (certainly not by the language
learning infant), suggesting that its organizing
principles differ from those of the written
language. So, arguably, a speech grammar
inducing algorithm should avoid referring to the
usual categories of text based linguistics ?
'sentence', 'determiner phrase', etc.1
Instead we allow a large, indefinite number
of (indistinguishable) basic categories ? and then
leave it to the learner to shape them, fill them
up, and combine them. For this task, the learner
needs a built-in concept of constituency. This
kind of innateness is not in conflict with our
main hypothesis, we believe, since constituency
as such is not specific to linguistic structure.
1.2 Logical preliminaries
For the reasons explained, we want the learning
algorithm to be strictly data-driven. This puts
special demands on our parser which must be
robust enough to accept input strings with little
or no hints of syntactic structure (for the early
stages of a learning session), while at the same
time retaining the discriminating powers of a
standard context free parser (for the later stages).
Our solution is a sequent calculus, a variant
of the Gentzen-Lambek categorial grammar
formalism (L) enhanced with non-classical rules
for isolating a residue of uninterpretable sequent
elements. The classical part is identical to L
(except that antecedents may be empty).
Classical part
       ??????? link
 ? ? ?
  ?B ? B      ?1  A  ?2 ? C
????????????????????? /L
     ?1  A/B  ?B  ?2 ? C
  ?0  B  ? A
?????????? /R
   ?0 ? A/B
  ?B ? B      ?1  A  ?2 ? C
????????????????????? \L
     ?1  ?B  B\A  ?2 ? C
  B  ?0 ? A
?????????? \R
   ?0 ? B\A
   ?1  A  B  ?2 ? C
 ??????????????? *L
   ?1  A*B  ?2 ? C
  ?1 ? A     ?2 ? B
??????????????? *R
     ?1  ?2 ? A*B
A, B, C are categories; ?x are (possibly empty)
strings of categories.
                                                     
1
 Hoekstra (2000) and Nivre (2001) discuss the
annotation of spoken corpora with traditional tags.
These seven rules capture the input parts that
can be interpreted as syntactic constituents
(examples below). For the remaining parts, we
include two non-classical rules (?L and ?R).2
Non-classical part
?+         ?1  ?2 ? C
    ?????????????????? ?L
?1  ?  ?2  ? C
 ??
    ?????? ?R
? ?
? is a basic category. ?x are (possibly empty)
strings of categories. Superscripts + ? denote
polarity of residual elements.
By way of an example, consider the input string
right well let's er let's look at the applications
as analyzed in an early stage of a learning
session. Since no lexical structure has developed
yet, the input is mapped onto a sequent of basic
(dummy) categories:3
c29  c22  c81  c5  c81  c215  c10  c1  c891 ? c0
Using ?L recursively, each category of the
antecedent (the part to the left of ?) is removed
from the main sequent. As the procedure is fairly
simple, we just show a fragment of the proof.
Notice that proofs read most easily bottom-up.
 c0
?
????? ?R

+
  c10

??????????????????????????????? ?L
     ...  c5  c81  c215  c10  c1  c891 ? c0
In this proof there are no links, meaning that no
grammatical structure was found. Later, when
the lexicon has developed, the parser may

 The calculus presented here is slightly simplified.
Two rules are missing, and so is the reserved
category T ('noise') used e.g. for consequents (in
place of c0 of the example). Cf. Henrichsen (2000).

 By convention the indexing of category names
reflects the frequency distribution: If word W has
rank n in the training corpus, it is initialized as W:cn .

?????????????????????????????????????\L
 ...  c81 c215/(c10*c891) c10  c1 c1\c891 ? c0
 ... let's        look  at the  applications
This proof tree has three links, meaning that the
disorder of the input string (wrt. the new
lexicon) has dropped by three degrees. More on
disorder shortly.
1.3 The algorithm in outline
Having presented the sequent parser, we now
show its embedding in the learning algorithm
GraSp (Grammar of Speech).
For reasons mentioned earlier, the common
inventory of categories (S, NP, CN, etc) is
avoided. Instead each lexeme initially inhabits
its own proto-category. If a training corpus has,
say, 12,345 word types the initial lexicon maps
them onto as many different categories. A
learning session, then, is a sequence of lexical
changes, introducing, removing, and
manipulating the operators /, \, and * as guided
by a well-defined measure of structural disorder.
We prefer formal terms without a linguistic
bias ("no innate linguistic constraints").
Suggestive linguistic interpretations are
provided in square brackets.
A-F summarize the learning algorithm.
A) There are categories. Complex categories are
built from basic categories using /, \, and *:
Basic categories
c1,  c2,  c3, ... ,  c12345 , ...
Complex categories
c1\c12345,  c2/c3,  c4*c5,  c2/(c3\(c4*c5))
B) A lexicon is a mapping of lexemes [word
types represented in phonetic or enriched-
orthographic encoding] onto categories.
C) An input segment is an instance of a lexeme
[an input word]. A solo is a string of segments
[an utterance delimited by e.g. turntakes and
pauses]. A corpus is a bag of soli [a transcript of
a conversation].
D) Applying an update L:C1?C2 in lexicon Lex
means changing the mapping of L in Lex from
C1 to C2. Valid changes are minimal, i.e. C2 is
construed from C1 by adding or removing 1
basic category (using \, /, or *).
E) The learning process is guided by a measure
of disorder. The disorder function Dis takes a
sequent ? [the lexical mapping of an utterance]
returning the number of uninterpretable atoms in
?, i.e. ?+s and ??s in a (maximally linked) proof.
Dis(?)=0 iff ? is Lambek valid. Examples:
Dis(  ca/cb  cb  ? ca  ) =  0
Dis(  ca/cb  cb  ? cc  ) =  2
Dis(  cb  ca/cb  ? cc  ) =  4
Dis(  ca/cb  cc  cb  ? ca  ) =  1
Dis(  ca/cc  cb  ca\cc  ? ca  ) =  2
DIS(Lex,K) is the total amount of disorder in
training corpus K wrt. lexicon Lex, i.e. the sum
of Dis-values for all soli in K as mapped by Lex.
F) A learning session is an iterative process. In
each iteration i a suitable update Ui is applied in
the lexicon Lexi?1 producing Lexi . Quantifying
over all possible updates, Ui is picked so as to
maximize the drop in disorder (DisDrop):
DisDrop  =  DIS(Lexi?1,K) ? DIS(Lexi,K)
The session terminates when no suitable update
remains.
It is possible to GraSp efficiently and yet
preserve logical completeness. See Henrichsen
(2000) for discussion and demonstrations.
1.4 A staged learning session
Given this tiny corpus of four soli ('utterances')
if you must you can
if you must you must and if we must we must
if you must you can and if you can you must
if we must you must and if you must you must
, GraSp produces the lexicon below.

if c3 (c3/c1)/c1 (S/S)/S
and c4 (c3\c4)/c3 (S\S)/S
can c5 c2\c1 NP\S
we c6 c2 NP
As shown, training corpora can be manufactured
so as to produce lexical structure fairly similar to
what is found in CG textbooks. Such close
similarity is however not typical of 'naturalistic'
learning sessions ? as will be clear in section 2.
1.5  Why categorial grammar?
In CG, all structural information is located in the
lexicon. Grammar rules (e.g. VP ? Vt N) and
parts of speech (e.g. 'transitive verb', 'common
noun') are treated as variants of the same formal
kind. This reduces the dimensionality of the
logical learning space, since a CG-based learner
needs to induce just a single kind of structure.
Besides its formal elegance, the CG basis
accomodates a particular kind of cognitive
models, viz. those that reject the idea of separate
mental modules for lexical and grammatical
processing (e.g. Bates 1997). As we see it, our
formal approach allows us the luxury of not
taking sides in the heated debate of modularity.5
2 Learning from spoken language
The current GraSp implementation completes a
learning session in about one hour when fed
with our main corpus.6 Such a session spans
2500-4000 iterations and delivers a lexicon rich
                                                     
4
 For perspicuity, two of the GraSped categories ?
viz. 'can':(c2\c5)*(c5\c1)  and  'we':(c2/c6)*c6 ? are
replaced in the table by functional equivalents.
5
 A caveat: Even if we do share some tools with other
CG-based NL learning programmes, our goals are
distinct, and our results do not compare easily with
e.g. Kanazawa (1994), Watkinson (2000). In terms of
philosophy, GraSp seems closer to connectionist
approaches to NLL.

 The Danish corpus BySoc (person interviews). Size:
1.0 mio. words. Duration: 100 hours. Style: Labovian
interviews. Transcription: Enriched orthography.
Tagging: none. Ref.: http://www.cphling.dk/BySoc
in microparadigms and microstructure. Lexical
structure develops mainly around content words
while most function words retain their initial
category. The structure grown is almost fractal
in character with lots of inter-connected
categories, while the traditional large open
classes ? nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. ? are
absent as such. The following sections present
some samples from the main corpus session
(Henrichsen 2000 has a detailed description).
2.1 Microparadigms
{ "Den Franske", "Nyboder",
"S?lvgades", "Krebses" }
These four lexemes ? or rather lexeme clusters ?
chose to co-categorize. The collection does not
resemble a traditional syntactic paradigm, yet
the connection is quite clear: all four items
appeared in the training corpus as names of
primary schools.

Krebses c3865 (c3865/c288)*c97
Skole c288 c97\c288
The final categories are superficially different,
but are easily seen to be functionally equivalent.
The same session delivered several other
microparadigms: a collection of family members
(in English translation: brother, grandfather,
younger-brother, stepfather, sister-in-law, etc.),
a class of negative polarity items, a class of mass
terms, a class of disjunctive operators, etc.
(Henrichsen 2000 6.4.2).
GraSp-paradigms are usually small and
almost always intuitively 'natural' (not unlike the
small categories of L1 learners reported by e.g.
Lucariello 1985).
2.2 Microgrammars
GraSp'ed grammar rules are generally not of the
kind studied within traditional phrase structure
grammar. Still PSG-like 'islands' do occur, in the
form of isolated networks of connected lexemes.

2.3 Idioms and locutions
Consider the five utterances of the main corpus
containing the word 'rafle' (cast-diceINF):8
det g?r den der er ikke noget at rafle om der
der er ikke s? meget at rafle om
der er ikke noget og rafle om
s?tte sig ned og rafle lidt med fyrene der
at rafle om der
On most of its occurrences, 'rafle' takes part in
the idiom "der er ikke noget/meget og/at rafle
om", often followed by a resumptive 'der'
(literally: there is not anything/much and/to
                                                     
7
 Lexemes 'Sankt', 'Sct.', and 'Skt.' have in effect
cocategorized, since it holds that (x/y)*y ? x. This
cocategorization is quite neat considering that GraSp
is blind to the interior of lexemes. c9 and c22 are the
categories of 'i' (in) and 'p?' (on).
8
 In writing, only two out of five would probably
qualify as syntactically well-formed sentences.
cast-diceINF about (there), meaning: this is not a
subject of negotiations). Lexeme 'ikke' (category
c8) occurs in the left context of 'rafle' more often
than not, and this fact is reflected in the final
category of 'rafle':
rafle: ((c12\(c8\(c5\(c7\c5808))))/c7)/c42
Similarly for the lexemes 'der' (c7), 'er' (c5), 'at'
(c12), and 'om' (c42) which are also present in the
argument structure of the category, while the top
functor is the initial 'rafle' category (c5808).
The minimal context motivating the full
rafle category is:
... der ... er ... ikke ... at ... rafle ... om ... der ...
("..." means that any amount and kind of
material may intervene). This template is a quite
accurate description of an acknowledged Danish
idiom.
Such idioms have a specific categorial
signature in the GraSped lexicon: a rich, but flat
argument structure (i.e. analyzed solely by ?R)
centered around a single low-frequency functor
(analyzed by ?L). Further examples with the
same signature:
... det ... kan ... man ... ikke ... fort?nke ... i ...
... det ... vil ... bl?se ... p? ...
... ikke ... en ... kinamands ... chance ...
? all well-known Danish locutions.9
There are of course plenty of simpler and
faster algorithms available for extracting idioms.
Most such algorithms however include specific
knowledge about idioms (topological and
morphological patterns, concepts of mutual
information, heuristic and statistical rules, etc.).
Our algorithm has no such inclination: it does
not search for idioms, but merely finds them.
Observe also that GraSp may induce idiom
templates like the ones shown even from corpora
without a single verbatim occurrence.
                                                     
9
 For entry rafle, Danish-Danish dictionary Politiken
has this paradigmatic example: "Der er ikke noget at
rafle om". Also fort?nke, bl?se, kinamands have
examples near-identical with the learned templates.
3 Learning from exotic corpora
In order to test GraSp as a general purpose
learner we have used the algorithm on a range of
non-verbal data. We have had GraSp study
melodic patterns in musical scores and prosodic
patterns in spontaneous speech (and even dna-
structure of the banana fly). Results are not yet
conclusive, but encouraging (Henrichsen 2002).
When fed with HTML-formatted text,
GraSp delivers a lexical patchwork of linguistic
structure and HTML-structure. GraSp's
uncritical appetite for context-free structure
makes it a candidate for intelligent web-
crawling. We are preparing an experiment with a
large number of cloned learners to be let loose in
the internet, reporting back on the structure of
the documents they see. Since GraSp produces
formatting definitions as output (rather than
requiring it as input), the algorithm could save
the www-programmer the troubles of preparing
his web-crawler for this-and-that format.
Of course such experiments are side-issues.
However, as discussed in the next section,
learning from non-verbal sources may serve as
an inspiration in the L1 learning domain also.
4 Towards a model of L1 acquisition
4.1 Artificial language learning
Training infants in language tasks within
artificial (i.e. semantically empty) languages is
an established psycho-linguistic method. Infants
have been shown able to extract structural
information ? e.g. rules of phonemic
segmentation, prosodic contour, and even
abstract grammar (Cutler 1994, Gomez 1999,
Ellefson 2000) ? from streams of carefully
designed nonsense. Such results are an important
source of inspiration for us, since the
experimental conditions are relatively easy to
simulate. We are conducting a series of 'retakes'
with the GraSp learner in the subject's role.
Below we present an example.
In an often-quoted experiment, psychologist
Jenny Saffran and her team had eight-months-
old infants listening to continuous streams of
nonsense syllables: ti, do, pa, bu, la, go, etc.
Some streams were organized in three-syllable
'words' like padoti and golabu (repeated in
random order) while others consisted of the
same syllables in random order. After just two
minutes of listening, the subjects were able to
distinguish the two kinds of streams.
Conclusion: Infants can learn to identify
compound words on the basis of structural clues
alone, in a semantic vacuum.
Presented with similar streams of syllables,
the GraSp learner too discovers word-hood.

... ... ...
It may be objected that such streams of
presegmented syllables do not represent the
experimental conditions faithfully, leaping over
the difficult task of segmentation. While we do
not yet have a definitive answer to this
objection, we observe that replacing "pa do ti go
la bu (..)" by "p a d o t i g o l a b u (..)" has the
GraSp learner discover syllable-hood and word-
hood on a par.11
4.2 Naturalistic language learning
Even if human learners can demonstrably learn
structural rules without access to semantic and
pragmatic cues, this is certainly not the typical
L1 acquisition scenario. Our current learning
model fails to reflect the natural conditions in a
number of ways, being a purely syntactic
calculus working on symbolic input organized in
well-delimited strings. Natural learning, in
contrast, draws on far richer input sources:
? continuous (unsegmented) input streams
? suprasegmental (prosodic) information
? sensory data
? background knowledge
                                                     
10
 As seen, padoti has selected do for its functional
head, and golabu, bu. These choices are arbitrary.
11
 The very influential Eimas (1971) showed one-
month-old infants to be able to distinguish /p/ and /b/.
Many follow-ups have established that phonemic
segmentation develops very early and may be innate.
Any model of first language acquisition must be
prepared to integrate such information sources.
Among these, the extra-linguistic sources are
perhaps the most challenging, since they
introduce a syntactic-semantic interface in the
model. As it seems, the formal simplicity of one-
dimensional learning (cf. sect. 1.5) is at stake.
If, however, semantic information (such as
sensory data) could be 'syntactified' and included
in the lexical structure in a principled way,
single stratum learning could be regained. We
are currently working on a formal upgrading of
the calculus using a framework of constructive
type theory (Coquant 1988, Ranta 1994). In
CTT, the radical lexicalism of categorial
grammar is taken even a step further,
representing semantic information in the same
data structure as grammatical and lexical
information. This formal upgrading takes a
substantial refinement of the Dis function (cf.
sect. 1.3 E) as the determination of 'structural
disorder' must now include contextual reasoning
(cf. Henrichsen 1998). We are pursuing a design
with ?+ and ?? as instructions to respectively
insert and search for information in a CTT-style
context.
These formal considerations are reflections
of our cognitive hypotheses. Our aim is to study
learning as a radically data-driven process
drawing on linguistic and extra-linguistic
information sources on a par ? and we should
like our formal system to fit like a glove.
5 Concluding remarks
As far as we know, GraSp is the first published
algorithm for extracting grammatical taxonomy
out of untagged corpora of spoken language.12
This in an uneasy situation, since if our findings
are not comparable to those of other approaches
to grammar learning, how could our results be
judged ? or falsified? Important issues wide
open to discussion are: validation of results,
psycho-linguistic relevance of the experimental
setup, principled ways of surpassing the context-
free limitations of Lambek grammar (inherited
in GraSp), just to mention a few.
On the other hand, already the spin-offs of
our project (the collection of non-linguistic
learners) do inspire confidence in our tenets, we

realism has so far only just been touched.
