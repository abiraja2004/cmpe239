ABSTRACT: 
This paper 1 develops a method for combining query- 
relevance with information-novelty in the context of 
text retrieval and summarization. The Maximal Marginal 
Relevance (MMR) criterion strives to reduce 
redundancy while maintaining query relevance in re- 
ranking retrieved documents and in selecting 
appropriate passages for text summarization. 
Preliminary results indicate some benefits for MMR 
diversity ranking in ad-hoc query and in single 
document summarization. The latter are borne out by 
the trial-run (unofficial) TREC-style evaluation of 
summarization systems. However, the clearest 
advantage is demonstrated in the automated construction 
of large document and non-redundant multi-document 
summaries, where MMR results are clearly superior to 
non-MMR passage selection. This paper also discusses 
our preliminary evaluation of summarization methods 
for single documents. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
With the continuing rowth of online information, it 
has become increasingly important to provide improved 
mechanisms to find information quickly. Conventional 
IR systems rank and assimilate documents based on 
maximizing relevance to the user query \[1, 8, 6, 12, 13\]. 
In cases where relevant documents are few, or cases 
where very-high recall is necessary, pure relevance 
ranking is very appropriate. But in cases where there is 
a vast sea of potentially relevant documents, highly 
redundant with each other or (in the extreme) containing 
partially or fully duplicative information we must utilize 
means beyond pure relevance for document ranking. 
In order to better illustrate the need to combine 
relevance and anti-redundancy, consider a reporter or a

student, using a newswire archive collection to research 
accounts of airline disasters. He composes a well- 
though-out query including "airline crash", "FAA 
investigation", "passenger deaths", "fire", "airplane 
accidents", and so on. The IR engine returns a ranked 
list of the top 100 documents (more if requested), and 
the user examines the top-ranked ocument. It's about 
the suspicious TWA-800 crash near Long Island. Very 
relevant and useful. The next document is also about 
"TWA-800", so is the next, and so are the following 30 
documents. Relevant? Yes. Useful? Decreasingly so. 
Most "new" documents merely repeat information 
already contained in previously offered ones, and the 
user could have tired long before reaching the first non- 
TWA-800 air disaster document. Perfect precision, 
therefore, may prove insufficient in meeting user needs. 
A better document ranking method for this user is one 
where each document in the ranked list is selected 
according to a combined criterion of query relevance 
and novelty of information. The latter measures the 
degree of dissimilarity between the document being 
considered and previously selected ones already in the 
ranked list. Of course, some users may prefer to drill 
down on a narrow topic, and others a panoramic 
sampling bearing relevance to the query. Best is a user- 
tunable method that focuses the search from a narrow 
beam to a floodlight. Maximal Marginal Relevance 
(MMR) provides precisely such functionality, as 
discussed below. 
If we consider document summarization by relevant- 
passage extraction, we must again consider anti- 
redundancy as well as relevance. Both query-free 
summaries and query-relevant summaries need to avoid 
redundancy, as it defeats the purpose of summarization. 
For instance, scholarly articles often state their thesis in 
the introduction, elaborate upon it in the body, and" 
reiterate it in the conclusion. Including all three in 
versions in the summary, however, leaves little room for 
other useful information. If we move beyond single 
document summarization to document cluster 
summarization, where the summary must pool passages 
181 
from different but possibly overlapping documents, 
reducing redundancy becomes an even more significant 
problem. 
Automated document summarization dates back to 
Luhn's work at IBM in the 1950's \[12\], and evolved 
through several efforts including Tait \[24\] and Paice in 
the 1980s \[17, 18\]. Much early work focused on the 
structure of the document to select information. In the 
1990's everal approaches to summarization blossomed, 
include trainable methods \[10\], linguistic approaches \[8, 
15\] and our information-centric method \[2\], the first to 
focus on query-relevant summaries and anti-redundancy 
measures. As part of the TIPSTER program \[25\], new 
investigations have started into summary creation using 
a variety of strategies. These new efforts address query 
relevant as well as "generic" summaries and utilize a 
variety of approaches including using co-reference 
chains (from the University of Pennsylvania) \[25\], the 
combination of statistical and linguistic approaches 
(Smart and Empire) from SaBir Research, Cornell 
University and GE R&D Labs, topic identification and 
interpretation from the ISI, and template based 
summarization from New Mexico State University \[25\]. 
In this paper, we discuss the Maximal Marginal 
Relevance method (Section 2), its use for document 
reranking (Section 3), our approach to query-based 
single document summarization (Section 4), and our 
approach to long documents (Section 6) and multi- 
document summarization (Section 6). We also discuss 
our evaluation efforts of single document summarization 
(Section 7-8) and our preliminary results (Section 9). 
2. MAXIMAL MARGINAL  RELEVANCE 
Most modern IR search engines produce a ranked list 
of retrieved ocuments ordered by declining relevance 
to the user's query \[1, 18, 21, 26\]. In contrast, we 
motivated the need for '"relevant novelty" as a 
potentially superior criterion. However, there is no 
known way to directly measure new-and-relevant 
information, especially given traditional bag-of-words 
methods uch as the vector-space model \[19, 21\]. A 
first approximation to measuring relevant novelty is to 
measure relevance and novelty independently and 
provide a linear combination as the metric. We call the 
linear combination "marginal relevance" -- i.e. a 
document has high marginal relevance if it is both 
relevant to the query and contains minimal similarity to 
previously selected ocuments. We strive to maximize 
marginal relevance in retrieval and summarization, 
hence we label our method "maximal marginal 
relevance" (MMR). 
The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) metric is 
defined as follows: 
Let C = document collection (or document stream) 
Let Q = ad-hoc query (or analyst-profile or 
topic/category specification) 
Let R = IR (C, Q, q) - i.e. the ranked list of 
documents retrieved by an IR system, given C and Q 
and a relevance threshold theta, below which it will not 
retrieve documents. (q can be degree of match, or 
number of documents). 
Let S = subset of documents in R already provided to 
the user. (Note that in an IR system without MMR and 
dynamic reranking, S is typically a proper prefix of list 
R.) R~ is the set difference, i.e. the set of documents in
R, not yet offered to the user. 
def 
MMR(C,Q,R,S)=Argmax\[X*Sim 1 (Di,Q)-(1-X)Max(Sim2(Di,Dj))\] 
Di ~R\S Dj eS 
Given the above definition, MMR computes 
incrementally the standard relevance-ranked list when 
the parameter ~=1, and computes a maximal diversity 
ranking among the documents in R when X=0. For 
intermediate values of ~, in the interval \[0,1\], a linear 
combination of both criteria is optimized. Users wishing 
to sample the information space around the query, 
should set ~, at a smaller value, and those wishing to 
focus in on multiple potentially overlapping or 
reinforcing relevant documents, hould set ~, to a value 
closer to 1. For document retrieval, we found that a 
particularly effective search strategy (reinforced by the 
user study discussed below) is to start with a small L 
(e.g. ~, = .3) in order to understand the information space 
in the region of the query, and then to focus on the most 
important parts using a reformulated query (possibly via 
relevance feedback) and a larger value of ~ (e.g. ~, = .7). 
Note that the similarity metric Sim 1 used in document 
retrieval and relevance ranking between documents and 
query could be the same as Sim2 between documents 
(e.g., both could be cosine similarity), but this need not 
be the case. A more accurate, but computationally more 
costly metric could be used when applied only to the 
elements of the retrieved ocument set R, given that IRI 
<< ICI, if MMR is applied for re-ranking the top portion 
of the ranked list produced by a standard IR system.

Table 1: Initial Relevance Ranking (~, = 1) vs. MMR reranking (~L = .7 & X = .3) 
3. DOCUMENT REORDERING 
We implemented MMR in two retrieval engines, 
PURSUIT (an upgraded version of the original 
TM retrieval engine inside the Lycos search engine), 
\[9\] and SMART (the publicly available version of the 
Cornell IR engine) \[1\]. Using the scoring functions 
available in each system for both Siml and Sim2, we 
obtained consistent and expected results in the 
behavior of the two systems. 
The results of MMR reranking are shown in Table 
1. In this Reuters document collection, article 1403 is 
a duplicate of 1388. MMR reranking performs as 
expected, for decreasing values of 1, the ranking of 
1403 drops. Also as predicted, novel but still 
relevant information as evidenced by document 69 
starts to increase in ranking. Relevant, but similar to 
the highest ranked documents, such as document 
1713 drop in ranked ordering. Document 2149 's 
position varies depending on its similarity to 
previously seen information. 
We also performed a pilot experiment with five 
users who were undergraduates from various 
disciplines. The purpose of the study was to find out 
if they could tell what was the difference between the 
standard ranked document order retrieved by 
SMART and a MMR reranked order with X = ..5. 
They were asked to perform nine different search 
tasks to find information and asked various questions 
about the tasks. They used two methods to retrieve 
documents, known only as R and S. Parallel tasks 
were constructed so that one set of users would 
perform method R on one task and method S on a 
similar task. Users were not told how the documents 
were presented only that either "method R" or 
"method S" were used and that they needed to be try 
to distinguish the differences between methods. After 
each task we asked them to record the information 
found. We also asked them to look at the ranking for 
method R and method S and see if they could tell any 
difference between the two. The majority of people 
said they preferred the method which gave in their 
opinion the most broad and interesting topics. In the 
final section they were asked to select a search 
method and use it for a search task. 80% (4 out of 5) 
chose the method MMR to use. The person who 
chose Smart stated it was because "it tends to group 
more like stories together." The users indicated a 
differential preference for MMR in navigation and for 
locating the relevant candidate documents more 
quickly, and pure-relevance ranking when looking at 
related ocuments within that band. Three of the five 
users clearly discovered the differential utility of 
diversity search and relevance-only search. One user 
explicitly stated his strategy: 
"Method R \[relevance only\] groups items 
together based on similarity and Method S 
\[MMR re-ranking\] gives a wider array. I would 
183 
use Method S \[MMR re-ranking\] to find a topic 
... and then use Method R \[relevance-only\] with 
a specific search from Method S \[MMR re- 
rankingl to yield a lot of closely related items." 
The initial study was too small to yield statistically 
significant trends with respect to speed of known-item 
retrieval, or recall improvements for broader query 
tasks. However, based on our own experience and 
questionnaire responses from the five users, we 
expect that task demands play a large role with 
respect to which method yields better performance. 
4. S INGLE DOCUMENT SUMMARIES  
Human summarization of documents, sometimes 
called "abstraction" is a fixed-length generic 
summary, reflecting the key points that the abstractor 
-- rather than the user -- deems important. Consider a 
physician evaluating a particular chemotherapy 
regimen who wants to know about its adverse ffects 
to elderly female patients. The retrieval engine 
produces several lengthy reports (e.g. a 300-page 
clinical study), whose abstracts do not contain any 
hint of whether there is information regarding effects 
on elderly patients. A useful summary for this 
physician would contain query-relevant passages (e.g. 
differential adverse effects on elderly males and 
females, buried in page 211-212 of the clinical study) 
assembled into a summary. A different user with 
different information needs may require a totally 
different summary of the same document. 
We developed a minimal-redundancy query- 
relevant summarizer-by-extraction method, which 
differs from previous work in summarization \[10, 12, 
15, 18, 24\] in several dimensions. 
? Optional query relevance: as discussed above a 
query or a user interest profile (for the vector sum 
of both, appropriately weighted) is used to select 
relevant passages. If a generic query-free summary 
is desired, the centroid vector of the document is 
calculated and passages are selected with the 
principal components of the centroid as the query. 
? Variable granularity summarization: The 
length of the summary is under user control. Brief 
summaries are useful for indicative purposes (e.g. 
whether to read further), and longer ones for 
drilling and extracting detailed information. 
? Non-redundancy: Information density is 
enhanced by ensuring a degree of dissimilarity 
between passages contained in the summary. The 
degree of query-focus vs. diversity sampling is 
under user control (the ~, parameter in the MMR 
formula). 
Our process for creating single document 
summaries i as follows: 
1. Segment a document into passages and index the 
passages using the inverted indexing method used 
by the IR engine for full documents. Passages 
may be phrases, sentences, n-sentence chunks, or 
paragraphs. For the TIPSTER III evaluation, we 
used sentences as passages. 
2. Within a document, identify the passages relevant 
to the query. Use a threshold below which the 
passages are discarded. We used a similarity 
metric based on cosine similarity using the 
traditional TF-IDF weights. 
3. Apply the MMR metric as defined in Section 2 to 
the passages (rather than full documents). 
Depending on the desired length of the summary, 
select a few or larger number. If the parameter 
is not very close to 1, redundant query relevant 
passages will tend to be eliminated and other 
different, slightly less query relevant passages will 
be included. We allow the user to select the 
number of passages or the percentage of the 
document size (also known as the "compression 
ratio"). 
4. Reassemble the selected passages into a summary 
document using one of the following summary- 
cohesion criteria: 
? Document appearance order: Present the 
segments according to their order of presentation 
in the original document. If the first sentence is 
longer than a threshold, we automatically include 
this sentence in the summary as it tends to set the 
context for the article. If the user only wants to 
view a few segments, the first sentence must also 
meet a threshold for sentence rank to be 
included. 
? News-story principle: Present he information in 
MMR-ranked order, i.e., the most relevant and 
most diverse information first. In this manner, 
the reader gets the maximal information even if 
they stop reading the summary. This allows the 
diversity of relevant information to be presented 
earlier and topic introduced may be revisited 
after other relevant topics have been introduced. 
? Topic-cohesion principle: First group together 
the document segments by topic clustering (using 
sub-document similarity criteria). Then rank the 
centroids of each cluster by MMR (most 
important first) and present the information, a 
184 
topic-coherent cluster at a time, starting with the 
cluster whose centroid ranks highest. 
We implemented query-relevant document- 
appearance-based sequencing of information. Our 
method of summarization does not require the more 
elaborate language-regeneration needed by Kathy 
McKeown and her group at Columbia in their 
summarization work \[15\]. As such our method is 
simpler, faster and more widely applicable, but yields 
potentially less cohesive summaries. All summary 
results in this paper use the SMART search engine 
with stopwords eliminated from the indexed ata and 
stemming. 
Query: Delaunay refinement mesh generation finite element 
method foundations three dimension analysis; ~ = .3 
\[1\] Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating 
unstructured meshes of triangles or tetrahedra suitable for 
use in the finite element method or other numerical methods 
for solving partial differential equations. 
\[5\] The purpose of this thesis is to further this progress by 
cementing the foundations of two-dimensional Delaunay 
refinement, and by extending the technique and its analysis 
to three dimensions. 
\[15\] Nevertheless, Delaunay refinement methods for 
tetrahedral mesh generation have the rare distinction that 
they offer strong theoretical bounds and frequently perform 
well in practice. 
\[39\] If one can generate meshes that are completely 
satisfying for numedcal techniques like the finite element 
method, the other applications fall easily in line. 
\[131\] Our understanding of the relative merit of different 
metrics for measuring element quality, or the effects of small 
numbers of poor quality elements on numedcal solutions, is 
based as much on engineedng expedence and rumor as it is 
on mathematical foundations. 
\[158\] Delaunay refinement methods are based upon a well- 
known geometric construction called the Delaunay 
triangulation, which is discussed extensively in the mesh 
generation chapter. 
\[201\] I first extend Ruppert's algorithm to three dimensions, 
and show that the extension generates nicely graded 
tetrahedral meshes whose circumradius-to-shortest edge 
ratios are nearly bounded below two. 
\[2250\] Refinement Algorithms for Quality Mesh Generation: 
Delaunay refinement algodthms for mesh generation 
operate by maintaining a Delaunay or constrained Delaunay 
triangulation, which is refined by inserting carefully placed 
vertices until the mesh meets constraints on element quality 
and size. 
\[3648\] I do not know to what difference between the 
algorithms one should attribute the slightly better bound for 
Delaunay refinement, nor whether it marks a real difference 
between the algodthms or is an artifact of the different 
methods of analysis.

Query: sliver mesh boundary removal small angles; ;L = .7 
\[1\] Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating 
unstructured meshes of tdangles or tetrahedra suitable for 
use in the finite element method or other numerical methods 
for solving partial differential equations. 
\[129\] Hence, many mesh generation algorithms take the 
approach of attempting to bound the smallest angle. 
\[2621\] Because s is locked, inserting a vertex at c will not 
remove t from the mesh. 
\[2860\] Of course, one must respect the PSLG; small input 
angles cannot be removed. 
\[3046\] The worst slivers can often be removed by Delaunay 
refinement, even if there is no theoretical guarantee. 
\[3047\] Meshes with bounds on the circumradius-to-shortest 
edge ratios of their tetrahedra re an excellent starting point 
for mesh smoothing and optimization methods designed to 
remove slivers and improve the quality of an existing mesh 
(see smoothing section). 
\[3686\] If one inserts a vertex at the circumcenter of each 
sliver tetrahedron, will the algorithm fail to terminate? 
\[3702\] A sliver can always be eliminated by splitting it, but 
how can one avoid creating new slivers in the process? 
\[3723\] Unfortunately, my practical success in removing 
slivers is probably due in part to the severe restdctions on 
input angle I have imposed upon Delaunay refinement. 
\[3724\] Practitioners report that they have the most difficulty 
removing slivers at the boundary of a mesh, especially near 
small angles.

5. SUMMARIZ ING 
DOCUMENTS 
LONGER 
The MMR-passage selection ':'method for 
summarization works better for longer documents 
(which typically contain more inherent passage 
redundancy across document sections such as 
abstract, introduction, conclusion, results, etc.). To 
demonstrate the quality of summaries that can be 
obtained for long documents, we summarized an 
entire dissertation containing 3,772 sentences with a 
generic topic query constructed by expanding the 
thesis title (Figure 1). In contrast, Figure 2 shows the 
results of a more specialized query with a larger L 
value to focus summarization less on diversity and 
more on topic. 
The above example demonstrates the utility of 
query relevance in summarization a d the incremental 
utility of controlling summary focus via the lambda 
parameter. It also highlights a shortcoming of 
summarization by extraction, namely coping with 
antecedent references. Sentence \[2621\] refers to 
coefficients "s", "c", and "t," which do not make 
sense outside the framework that defines them. Such 
referential problems are ameliorated with increased 
passage length, for instance using paragraphs rather 
than sentences. However, longer-passage s lection 
185 
also implies longer summaries. Another solution 
co-reference r solution \[25\]. 
6. MULT I -DOCUMENT SUMMARIES  
is 
As discussed earlier, MMR passage selection 
works equally well for summarizing single documents 
or clusters of topically related documents. Our 
method for multi-document summarization follows 
the same basic procedure as that of single document 
summarization (see section 4). In step 2 (Section 4), 
we identify the N most relevant passages from each of 
the documents in the collection and use them to form 
the passage set to be MMR re-ranked. N is dependent 
on the desired resultant length of the summary. We 
used N relevant passages from each document 
collection rather than the top relevant passages in the 
entire collection so that each article had a chance to 
provide a query-relevant contribution. In the future 
we intend to compare this to using MMR ranking 
where the entire document set is treated as a single 
document. Steps 2, 3 and 4 are primarily the same. 
The TIPSTER evaluation corpus provided several 
sets of topical clusters to which we applied MMR 
summarization. In one such example on a cluster of 
apartheid-related documents, we used the topic 
description as the query (see Figure 3) and N was set 
to 4 (4 sentences per article were reranked). The top 
10 sentences for ~ = 1 (effectively query relevance, 
but no MMR) and k = .3 (both query relevance and 
MMR anti-redundancy) are shown in Figures 4 and 5 
respectively. 
The summaries clearly demonstrate the need for 
MMR in passage selection. The 7~ = 1 case exhibits 
considerable redundancy, ranging from near- 
replication in passages \[4\] and \[5\] to redundant 
content in passages \[7\] and \[9\]. Whereas the L = .3 
case exhibits no such redundancy. Counting clearly 
distinct propositions in both cases yields a 20% 
greater information content for the MMR case, 
though both summaries are equivalent in length.

As can be seen from the above summaries, multi- 
document synthetic summaries require support in the 
user interface. In particular, the following issues 
need to be addressed: 
? Attributability: The user needs to be able to 
access easily the source of a given passage. 
This could be the single document summary 
(see Figure 6). 
? Contextually: The user needs to be able to 
zoom in on the context surrounding the chosen 
passages. 
? Redirection: The user should be able to 
highlight certain parts of the synthetic summary 
and give a command to the system indicating 
that these parts are to be weighted heavily and 
that other parts are to be given a lesser weight. 
7. EVALUATION OF  S INGLE 
DOCUMENT SUMMARIZAT ION 
An ideal text summary contains the relevant 
information for which the user is looking, excludes 
extraneous information, provides background to suit 
the user's profile, eliminates redundant information 
and filters out relevant information that the user 
knows or has seen. The first step in building such 
summaries i extracting the relevant pieces of articles 
to a user query. We performed a pilot evaluation in 
which we used a database of assessor marked relevant 
sentences to examine how well a summarization 
system could extract the relevant sections of 
documents. 
Automatically generating text extraction summaries 
based on a query or high frequency words from the 
text can produce a reasonable looking summary, yet 
this summary can be far from the optimal goal of 
quality summaries: readable, useful, intelligible, 
appropriate length summaries from which the 
information that the user is seeking can be extracted. 
Jones & Galliers define this type of evaluation as 
intrinsic (measuring a system's quality) compared to 
extrinsic (measuring a system's performance in a 
given task) \[7\]. 
In the past year, there has been a focus in TIPSTER 
on both the intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of 
summarization evaluation \[4\]. The evaluation 
consisted of three tasks (1) determining document 
relevance to a topic for query-relevant summaries (an 
indicative summary), (2) determining categorization 
for generic summaries (an indicative summary), (3) 
establishing whether summaries can answer a 
specified set of questions (an informative summary) 
by comparison to an ideal summary. In each task, the 
summaries are rated in terms of confidence in 
decision, intelligibility and length. Jing, Barzilay, 
McKeown and Elhadad \[6\] performed a pilot 
experiment (40 sentences) in which they examined 
the performance (precision-recall) of three 
summarization systems (one using notion of number 
of sentences, the other two using numbers of words or 
number of clauses). They compared the performance 
of these systems against human ideal summaries and 
found that different systems achieved their best 
performances at different lengths (compression 
ratios). They also found the same results for 
determining document relevance to a topic (one of the 
TIPSTER tasks) for query-relevant summaries. 
Our approach to summarization is different from 
Columbia and TIPSTER in that the focus is not on an 
"ideal human summary" of any particular document 
cutoff size. An ideal summarization system must first 
be able to recognize the relevant sentences (or parts 
of a document) for a topic or query and then be able 
to create a summary from these relevant segments. 
Although a list of words, an index or table of 
contents, is an appropriate label summary and can 
indicate relevance, informative summaries need at 
least noun-verb phrases. We choose to use the 
sentence as our underlying unit and evaluated 
summarization systems for the first stage of summary 
creation - coverage of relevant sentences. Other 
systems \[16, 23\] use the paragraph as a summary unit. 
Since the paragraph consists of more than one 
sentence and often more than one information unit, it 
is not as suitable for this type of evaluation, although 
it may be more suitable for a construction unit in 
summaries due to the additional context that it 
provides. For example., paragraphs will often solve 
co-reference issues, yet provide additional non- 
relevant information. One of the issues in 
188 
summarization evaluation is how to score (penalize) 
extraneous non-useful information contained in a 
summary. 
Unlike document information retrieval, text 
summarization evaluation has not extensively 
addressed the performance of different methodologies 
by evaluating the effects of different components. 
Most summarization systems use linguistic 
knowledge as well as a statistical component \[3, 5, 
16, 23\]. We applied the monolingual information 
retrieval method of query expansion \[20, 27, 28\] to 
summarization, using parts of the document to expand 
our queries. We also performed compression 
experiments. We used a modified version of the 11- 
pt average recall/precision (Section 9.2) to evaluate 
our results. 
8. EXPERIMENT DES IGN 
For our pilot experiment, we created two data sets, 
one based on relevant sentence judgments, the other 
based on model summaries (Section 8.1). We then 
defined a modified version of the 11-point average 
recall precision (Section 8.2) to use as our evaluation 
measure. We then performed experiments as 
described in Section 9 to evaluate the effects of 
MMR, query expansion, and compression. 
8.1 Data Sets 
We created two data sets for our pilot experiments. 
For the first { 110 Set} we took 50 documents from 
the TIPSTER evaluation provided set of 200 news 
articles spanning 1988-1991. All these documents 
were on the same topic (see Figure 3). Three 
evaluators ranked each of the sentences in the 
document as relevant, somewhat relevant and not 
relevant. For the purpose of this experiment, 
somewhat relevant was treated as relevant and the 
final score for the sentence was determined by a 
majority vote. The sentences that received this 
majority vote were tabulated as a relevant sentence 
(to the topic). The document was ranked as relevant 
or not relevant. All three assessors had 68% 
agreement in their relevance judgments. The query 
was extracted from the topic (see Figure 3). 
The second data set {Model Sutures} was provided 
as a training set for the Question and Answer portion 
of the TIPSTER evaluation. It consisted of "model 
summaries" which contained sentences of an article 
that answered a list of questions. These model 
sentences were used to score the summarizer. The 
query was extracted from the questions. 
8.2 Evaluation Code 
We modified the 11-pt recall-precision curves \[21\] 
commonly used for document information retrieval. 
Since many documents only have a few relevant 
sentences, corresponding curves for summarization 
have a lot of intervals with missing data items. To 
remedy this situation, we implemented a step function 
for the precision values. This allowed the recall 
intervals that would not naturally be filled to be 
assigned an actual precision value. For example, in 
the case of two relevant sentences in the document, 
points 0-5 (the first five intervals) would all have the 
first precision value (naturally occurring at point 5) 
and points 6-10 (the second value), the second value 
(naturally occurring at point 10). We interpolated the 
results of each query for the composite graph to form 
modified interpolated recall-precision curves. 
In order to account for the fact that a compressed 
summary does not have the opportunity to return the 
full set of relevant sentences, we use a normalized 
version of recall and a normalized version of F1 as 
defined below. 
Given: 
Rel = Number of Relevant Sentences inDocument 
RelSum = Number of Relevant Sentences inSummary 
SentSum = Number of Sentences inSummary 
Definitions: 
Precision P = RelSum / SentSum 
Recall R = RelSum / Rel 
F1 = 2P*R / (P + R) 
NorR = RelSum / rain (Rel, SentSum) 
NorF1 = 2P*NorR/(P+NorR) 
9. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
In this section we describe the experiments we 
performed and results obtained in evaluating the 
diversity gain - MMR (Section 9.1), query expansion 
(Section 9.2) and compression (Section 9.3). 
9.1 MMR (Diversity Gain) 
In order to evaluate what the relevance loss for the 
MMR diversity gain in single document 
summarization, we created summaries for two 
document length percentages (measured by number of 
sentences) and determined how many relevant 
sentences the summaries contained.

Table 4:110 Set - Relevant vs. Non-Relevant Documents with relevant sentences. 
The results are given in Table 2 for document 
percentages 0.25 and 0.1. Two precision scores were 
calculated, (1) that of TREC relevance plus at least 
one CMU assessor marking the document as relevant 
(yielding 23 documents) and (2) at least two of the 
three CMU assessor marking the document as 
relevant (yielding 15 documents). From these scores 
we can see there is no significant statistical difference 
between the ~,=1, ~,=.7, and 3.=.3 scores. This is often 
explained by cases where the L=l article failed to 
pick up a piece of relevant information and the 
reranking of k=.7 or .3 might or vice versa. The 
baseline (baseln) contains the first N sentences of the 
document, where N is the number of sentences in the 
summary. 
9.2 Query Expansion 
We expanded the original queries by: (1) adding 
the highest ranked sentence of the document (a form 
of pseudo-relevance feedback), (2) adding the title, 
and (3) adding the title and the highest ranked 
sentence. 
The most significant effects were shown for short 
queries (see Figures 7, 9). For the longer queries, the 
effect was less (see Figures 8, 10). For 20% 
document length (characters rounded up to the 
sentence boundary) adding the highest ranked 
sentence (prf) and title to the query helps 
performance for the 110 set relevant summary 
judgments (Figures 7, 8). For 10% document length,

Summary Length as Proportion of Document Length

for short queries just adding the title performed better 
than prf and the title (Figures 9,10). We will 
determine if these results hold over more extensive 
data. 
These results are similar to those obtained for 
document information retrieval \[27\]. Since 72% of 
the first sentences were marked relevant (Table 3), 
one area we plan to explore is results using the first 
sentence in the summary and/or query under specified 
circumstances, uch as our first sentence heuristics 
(Section 4). 
9.3 Compression 
An important evaluation criteria for summarization 
is what is the ideal summary output length 
(compression of the document) and how does it 
affects the user's task. To begin looking at this issue, 
we evaluated the performance of our system at 
different summary lengths as a percentage of the 
document length. 
We used a document compression factor based on 
the number of characters in the document. If this 
cutoff fell in the middle of a sentence the rest of the 
sentence was allowed, thus the output summary ends 
up being slightly longer than the actually compression 
factor. 
The data set statistics are shown in Tables 3 and 4. 
Note that non-relevant documents (Table 4) still have 
a high percentage of relevant sentences. Ten 
documents in the 110 set were non-relevant and had 
no relevant sentences. We also see that the summary 
length or number of relevant sentences chosen per 
document varies significantly. 
Summaries were compared using the modified 
interpolated normalized recall-precision curve as 
previously described (Section 8.2). 
In Figure 11, we examine the effect of compression 
on normalized recall and precision and in Figure 12, 
we show a plot of normalized F1. This F1 graph 
indicates that the normalized F1 score is helped by 
having the pseudo-relevance fe dback and title in the 
query thereby extracting relevant sentences that 
would otherwise be missed. As the number of 
sentences that are allowed in the summary grows, the 
difficulty of finding relevant sentences grows and 
thus the added prf sentence and title to the query help 
to find relevant sentences for their particular 
document. We need to do more studying on the 
effects of query expansion and compression on 
summarization, as well as see how our preliminary 
results hold for additional data sets. 
If we calculate the normalized F1 score for the first 
sentence retrieved in the summary, we obtain a score 
of .80 for 110 Set standard query, .67 for 110 Set 
short query and .79 for the Model Summaries. This 
indicates that even for the short query we obtain a 
relevant sentence two thirds of the time. However, 
ideally this first sentence retrieval score would be 1.0 
and we will explore methods to increase this score as 
well as select a "highly relevant" first retrieved 
sentence for the document. 
10. CONCLUSION 
We have shown that MMR ranking provides a 
useful and beneficial manner of providing 
information to the user by allowing the user to 
minimize redundancy. This is especially true in the 
case of query-relevant multi-document summarization 
in this one data collection. We are currently 
performing studies on how this extends to additional 
document collections. In the future we will also be 
investigating how to handle co-reference in our 
system as well as analyzing the most suitable ~, 
par/maeters and clustering the output results. 
Text Summarization is still in the infant stage in terms 
of evaluation. Many monolingual document 
information retrieval results can be applied to text 
summarization, but as of yet, there has been little 
evaluation of these techniques. This pilot experiment 
showed many areas that need to be examined in 
further detail, including whether the summary selects 
the most relevant sentences in the document and 
whether these results generalize to more data sets and 
other document genres. We also plan to explore 
further the effects of query expansion using WordNet, 
as well as the use the first sentence (for news stories) 
in the query and/or summary. We also plan to run 
experiments fixing the number of sentences for each 
document as the number of relevant sentences chosen 
by the assessors as well as a small number, such as 
three. We are currently in the process of building a 
more extensive sentence relevance database for 
further evaluation. In this database, we are collecting 
data on the user selected most relevant sentence(s) for 
each document. We also plan to explore how to join 
the relevant sections to provide a "good", 
understandable, readable, relevant, non-redundant 
summary.
