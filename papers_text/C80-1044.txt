Abst ract .  The concept  of a soft 
d i sp lay  key as app l ied  to input  of 
large character  sets or vocabu lar ies  
such as Kanj i ,  the anc ient  Ch inese  
ideograph ic  scr ipt  is d i scussed .  The 
Japanese  or thography  and the necess i ty  
of us ing Kanj i  characters  in data 
te rmina ls  are exp la ined .  P rob lems 
ar i s ing  from the number  and complex i ty  
of Kan j i  symbo ls  for the manufacture  
and use of keyboard  dev ices  are stated.  
A rev iew is made of dev ices  and methods  
present ly  used or suggested .  The 
feas ib i l i ty  of the soft d i sp lay  key is 
then demonst ra ted .  Some requ i rements  
for the des ign  and implementat ion  of a 
soft  d i sp lay  keyboard  for Kanj i  are 
cons idered .  In conc lus ion ,  
imp l i ca t ions  to man/computer  in ter face

In t roduct ion  
The Kanj i  Sc r ip t .  The Anc ient  
Ch inese  ideograph ic  wr i t ing  system, 
Kanj i ,  is today used in China, Japan 
and to some extent  in Korea.  A 
pr inc ipa l  advantage  of an ideograph ic  
scr ip t  is that its unders tand ing  does 
not suppose  knowledge of the spoken 
language.  Wr i t ten  Chinese,  e.g., is 
unders tood  all over the country ,  though 
the spoken languages  are mutua l ly  
incomprehens ib le  /~/. The main 
d i sadvantages  are obv ious ly  the large 
number  and graph ica l  complex i ty  of 
wr i t ten  characters  and the consequent  
hardsh ip  of learn ing  and wr i t ing  them. 
Once learned,  reading,  instead,  does 
not p resent  equal  d i f f i cu l ty  thanks to 
the exce l lent  pat tern  recogn i t ion  
ab i l i ty  of man. Complex  mean ings  are 
conveyed in condenced graph ica l  
pat terns ,  wh ich  are grasped at a 
g lance.  
Kan j i  Data Termina ls .  The real 
p roh ib i t ions  are, however ,  encountered  
in the des ign and manufactur ing  of 
typ ing  mach ines  and data te rmina ls  as 
wel l  as in the i r  operat ion .  The 
man/computer  in ter face  is a ser ious  
bot t leneck  a l ready  wi th  the European,  
modest ly  s ized a lphabet  and keyboard .  
Par t i cu la r ly  burn ing  this p rob lem is 
be ing  felt in Japan, where the computer  
and in fo rmat ion  indust r ies  are now in 
ful l  swing. 
In the ear ly  beg inn ing  data 
process ing  in Japan was done on the 
bas is  of romaj i ,  the European a lphabet .  
In Japanese  bus iness  and cu l ture  the 
Ch inese  Kanj i  and the Japanese  Kana 
wr i t ing  systems,  however ,  play the main 
role. There fore ,  in Japan there is no 
true so lu t ion  to computer i za t ion  
w i thout  the use of Kan j i  /I/. 
The demand for data te rmina ls  is 
inc reas ing  rap id ly .  For overcoming  the 
techn ica l ,  manufactur ing  and human 
fac tors  prob lems invo lved  in Kan j i  
input  a number  of d i f fe rent  approaches  
have been made or suggested .  Severa l  
k inds  of dev ices  and sys tems based on 
very  d i f fe rent  p r inc ip les  are in use, 
wh i le  many have remained  des igns  only. 
Some of these are rev iewed be low in 
order  to get ins ight  into the prob lem 
and the present  s i tuat ion .  
A techn ique  based on the d isp lay  
input  pr inc ip le  is then in t roduced and 
suggested  for cop ing  with the Kanj i  
input  prob lem.  The techn ique  is 
demonst ra ted  capab le  of' enter ing  all 
Kan j i  characters  on a normal  western  
s ize keyboard  wi th  normal  size 
characters  and operab le  by f inger.

The Japanese  Or thography  
The Japanese  or thography  is ra ther  
compl i ca ted .  Two k inds  of sc r ip t  are 
used - the Kanj i  and the Kana. Kanj i  
is the anc ient  p ic tograph ic  wr i t ing  
sys tem adopted  f rom Ch ina  about  1700 
years  ago. The Kanj i  characters  used 
today are e i ther  o r ig ina l  Ch inese  
symbo ls  or symbo ls  later  fo rmed or 
mod i f ied  in Japan.  
The Kana Sy l labar ies .  Kana is the 
Japanese  phonemic  wr i t ing  system. It 
cons is ts  of two sy l lab ic  a lphabets  - 
H i ragana  and Katakana .  These  are 
para l le l  character  sets, cons is t ing  of 
46 sy l lab ic  characters  and two 
d iacr i t i cs .  Both H i ragana  and Katakana  
denote  the same set of sy l lab les ,  but 
are used for d i f fe rent  purposes .  The i r  
g raph ics  have been der ived  from Kanj i ,  
but are cons iderab ly  s impler .  
Par t i cu la r ly  H i ragana  has been s t rong ly  
s imp l i f ied  into a k ind of shor thand.  
Al l  three character  sets are 
necessary  by t rad i t ion .  For Japanese  
words  both Ch inese  characters  and 
H i ragana  are used. H i ragana  is also 
used to form grammat ica l  end ings  and 
o ther  syntact i c  un i ts  to Kanj i  words,  
wh i le  loan words  f rom fore ign  languages  
are usua l ly  t ranscr ibed  in Katakana .  
In add i t ion ,  Katakana  is o f ten  used in 
po l i te  address ing  forms. The pat terns  
of usage are not, however ,  wel l  
de f ined .  Ever more of ten today one can 
see words  of Ch inese  or ig in  wr i t ten  in 
e i ther  Kanj i  or Kana or both 
in termixed .  
Kanj i  Character  Sets. 
D ic t ionar ies  of ' vary ing  coverage  In 
present  day use record  49,964,  14,942, 
9,921 and 3,885 Kan j i  characters  
respect ive ly  /2/. The number  of 
characters  su f f i c ient  for everyday  use 
such as read ing  newspapers  and 
magaz ines  var ies  f rom 2000 to 3000. 
About  2000 characters  have been 
des ignated  as essent ia l  and se lec ted  as 
a s tandard  set for pub l i sh ing .  A set 
of 881 characters  is used in bas ic  
educat ion  and fu r ther  a min imum of 1968 
characters  have been se lec ted  for 
educat iona l  purposes  by the Japanese  
Min is t ry  of Educat ion  /2/. 
Desp i te  the fa i r ly  large numbers  
of characters  recorded  in d ic t ionar ies ,  
some 200 most f requent ly  used Kanj i  
account  for over 50 per cent of the 
usage in text wh i le  800 Kanj i  
supp lemented  with  50 H i ragana  a l ready  
account  for 90 per cent of o rd inary  
text  /3/. 
The Inadequacy  o f  Kana. For 
p ract i ca l  purposes  such as typing,  it 
wou ld  be des i rab le  to be able to use 
the Kana sy l labar ies ,  s ince they can be 
managed with  convent iona l  keyboard  
techn iques .  But un for tunate ly  the Kana 
sys tems are l ingu is t i ca l l y  inadequate .  
The prob lem is po lysemy.  It is not 
uncommon that severa l  Kanj i  characters  
w i th  d i f fe rent  mean ing  have equal  or so 
s imi la r  p ronunc ia t ion  that they become 
ident ica l  in Kana. There  are e.g. 
some 70 Kanj i  characters ,  wh ich  are 
pronounced and t ranscr ibed  as "Shou" in 
Kana  /4/. On the other  hand many 
characters  have become to denote  
concepts  qui te  d i f fe rent  f rom the 
or ig ina l ,  wh ich  happened to have 
s imi la r  p ronunc ia t ion  /5/. Thus the 
phonet ic  and semant ic  inadequac ies  of 
the phonemic  sc r ip ts  necess i ta te  the 
use of the old Kanj i ,  wh ich  is 
unambiguous .  
P rob lems with  Kanj i  Input 
The main prob lems of us ing Kanj i  
are connected  wi th  the input  dev ices .  
For  output ,  a Kanj i  p r in ter  or  d i sp lay  
though more expens ive  than its European 
counterpar t ,  can be rea l i zed  by 
s tandard  output  techno log ies  such as 
matr ix  p r in ter  and CRT d isp lay ,  see 
e.g. /2,4 and 6/. The character  pr int  
head or d i sp lay  matr ix  only must have 
h igher  order  to give the requ i red  
graph ica l  reso lu t ion .  Kanj i  p r in ters  
are ava i lab le ,  wh ich  use pr int  head 
d imens ions  of e.g. 15 by 18 or 22 by 
24 dots. 
But for input  of Kanj i  characters  
we need a keyboard ,  wh ich  has a great 
many keys or some spec ia l  a r rangement  
by wh ich  all necessary  characters  can 
be entered.  I~ fact, an equ ipment ,  
wh ich  wou ld  a l low to encode all Kanj i  
characters  wou ld  be s imp ly  absurd  to 
imp lement  and to operate  by 
convent iona l  keyboard  techn iques .  In 
deve lop ing  keyboards  for typewr i te r ,  
te lex  and data te rmina ls  it has been 
necessary  to severe ly  res t r i c t  and 
care fu l ly  se lect  the set of characters  
to be inc luded.  Yet it has been 
necessary  e i ther  to squeeze  many 
characters  per key or to reduce  the key 
s ize so much that it can be operated  
only  by a spec ia l  imp lement .  Desp i te  
this,  soph is t i ca ted  spec ia l  techn iques  
for input  of nonstandard  characters  are 
necessary  in many app l i ca t ions .  
Nonstandard  characters  do f requent  in 
var ious  texts  and sub jec t  areas. The 
d i f f i cu l ty  wi th  them is not only that 
they are somet imes  ind ispensab le ,  but 
a lso that d i f fe rent  sets of nonstandard  
-288-  
characters  are needed 
app l i ca t ion  to another .

S.tandard Data  P rocess in~ Set. For 
the purposes  of data process ing  the 
In fo rmat ion  Process ing  Soc ie ty  of Japan 
has ins t i tu ted  a set of 6100 characters  
as a s tandard  set /2/. These inc lude 
the 1968 most common Kanj i  characters  
p lus  H i ragana  and Katakana ,  a set of 
sys tem or iented  Kanj i ,  a set of other  
sys tem or iented  symbo ls  and the 
ord inary  European a lphanumer ics  /2/. 
Not all of these are, however ,  usua l ly  
ava i lab le  on present  dev ices .  E.g. 
for the te rmina l  descr ibed  in /2/ the 
fo l low ing  sets have been se lec ted :  
Most  o f ten  used Kan j i  1,968

Tota l  4,936 
In the Japanese  card punch key 
ent ry  dev ice  deve loped  by IBM Japan and 
descr ibed  in /3/ there are 2,304 
characters .  In order  to make the 
keyboard  manageab le  by the human 
operator ,  the s ize of keys must have 
been made very smal l .  In the IBM 
equ ipment  the key d imens ion  is 4 mm. 
Th is  has permi t ted  to fit the keyboard  
on the table  of a normal  s ize card 
punch device.  
Us ing  such a keyboard  does, 
however ,  cause cons iderab le  eye s t ra in  
to the operator  and requ i res  a lot of 
hand t ranspor t .  Moreover ,  spec ia l  
means  of key ac tuat ion  such as a s ty lus  
as in /3/ or a pantograph  mechan ism as 
in /2/ and /7/ must  have been 
in t roduced .  
Decgmpos i t ion  Schemes.. A t tempts  
have been made to deve lop  ra t iona l  
decompos i t ion  schemes  in order  to break 
the characters  down into s imp ler  common 
e lements .  Th is  wou ld  a l low reduct ion  
of the keyboard  size. The characters  
cou ld  then be p iecewise  reassembled  by 
typ ing  from the i r  const i tuent  
components ,  see e.g. /8/. F rom 
techn ica l  v iewpo int  this approach  wou ld  
seem very advantageous .  But, 
un for tunate ly  there is l i t t le  natura l  
sys temat ics  and cons is tence  in the 
graph ica l  s t ruc ture  of the characters .  
There fore  any such scheme becomes 
ar t i f i c ia l  and d i f f i cu l t  to use. In 
add i t ion ,  such schemes  are o f ten 
insu f f i c ient  of descr ip t ion  and can 
somet imes  spec i fy  only c lasses  of 
characters .  
Character  Ar rangement .  St i l l  
another  source  of p rob lems is the 
ar rangement  of characters  on the 
keyboard .  In Kanj i  there is l i t t le  
inherent  sys temat ics ,  wh ich  could be 
compl ied  to. To min imize  search t ime 
and hand or s ty lus  t ranspor t ,  h igh 
f requency  characters  are o f ten ass igned  
to a cent ra l  area. E.g. the keyboards  
descr ibed  in /7/ and /15/ have used 
th is  p r inc ip le .  
One of the imperat ive  fac tors  in 
key ar rangement  is, however ,  the 
h i s to r i ca l  p recedent  /16/. In Japan 
th is  is determined  by the Kanj i  
Te le type ,  also re fer red  to as Kante le ,  
wh ich  has been used for th i r ty  years  in 
the newspaper  indust ry  /3/. Data input 
equ ipment  usua l ly  conform to the 
phonet ic  order,  wh ich  is genera l ly  used 
for typ ing  mach ines .  E.g. the 
equ ipment  descr ibed  in /7/ app l ies  this 
a r rangement .  
Typ ing  Speeds.  Desp i te  of the 
apparent  d i f f i cu l t ies ,  exce l lent  typ ing  
per fo rmance  can be ach ieved  in Kanj i  
input  th rough pract i c ing .  The f igures  
of words  per minute  and accuracy  
repor ted  in /3/ cor respond to those 
that  can be observed  on sk i l l ed  western  
card punch operators .  Thus, the 
enormous  d i f fe rence  between character  
set s ize and the key ing  techn iques  in 
the two cu l tu res  causes  l i t t le  
d i f fe rence  in the level  of sk i l l ed  
per fo rmance  /3/. The smal l  s ize of 
characters  causes,  however ,  more eye 
s t ra in  to the operator  and the large 
s ize of the keyboard  more fa t ique  to 
hand musc les  on the Japanese  equ ipment .  
A Rev iew of Techn iques  
An account  of some techn iques  and 
ex is t ing  dev ices  for Kan j i  input is 
g iven  in /4/. These  and some others  
found in l i t te ra ture  are br ie f ly  
rev iewed here. 
The Kanj i  Te le type .  Accord ing  to 
/4/ the Kan j i  Te le type  (Kante le)  is the 
most  commonly  used encod ing  equ ipment .  
Kante le  has 192 keys, each of wh ich  
bears  labe ls  of 13 Kan j i  characters .  A 
sh i f t  key pad of 13 shi f t  keys is used 
to se lect  among the 13 characters  on 
289 
each input key. The number  of keys has 
thus been reduced  s ign i f i cant ly ,  but 
there  are st i l l  cons iderab le  drawbacks :  
* The amount  of hand t ranspor t  and 
search ing  is st i l l  cons iderab le  
* The lack of log ica l  a r rangement  
p lagues  character  loca l i za t ion  
* There  is no fac i l i ty  for e i ther  
ver i f i ca t ion  nor for nonstandard  
character  input.  
Operator  per fo rmance  observed  wi th  
the shi f t  key method  seems to be 
in fe r io r  to methods  us ing  sty lus .  
A Ch inese  Typewr i te r  System.  In a 
Ch inese  Typewr i te r  Sys tem abst rac ted  in 
/9/, a keyboard  is p rov ided  for qu ick  
access  to a master  f i le of d ig i t i zed  
Kan j i  characters .  On top of the 
keyboard  is a character  re fe rence  
sheet ,  wh ich  is o rgan ized  accord ing  to 
the order  of the Ch inese  phonet ic  
a lphabet .  By appropr ia te  key ing  of a 
des i red  character ,  a mechan ism wi th in  
the cont ro l  unit  wi l l  access  the master  
f i le.  A graph ic  d i sp lay  is p rov ided  
for ver i f i ca t ion  of the entered  
characr te r .  Up to 9600 characters  are 
ava i lab le  in the system.  
The S inotype  Syste.m. This 
equ ipment  is based on the pr inc ip le  of 
compos ing  characters  f rom a smal l  set 
of s t rokes .  There  are 21 d i f fe rent  
e lementary  s t rokes  f rom wh ich  each 
character  can be const ruc ted  as a 
un ique  combinat ion .  An average  of six 
s t rokes  are requ i red  to form one 
character .  The d i sadvantages  are: 
The d i f f i cu l ty  of decompos ing  
characters  into a set of s t rokes  
* The d i f f i cu l ty  of remember ing  
the s t roke  combinat ions ,  wh ich  
are d i f fe rent  f rom the t rad i t -  
ional  ca l l ig raphy .  A spec ia l  
combinat ion  d ic t ionary  must be 
used. 
The S inowr i te r  System.  In this 
sys tem deve loped  by IBM a Kan j i  
character  is formed f rom two parts ,  the 
upper  and lower  half .  Both of these 
are c lass i f ied  us ing  36 s tandard  
subpat terns .  These operat ions  are, 
however ,  not su f f i c ient  to spec i fy  a 
character  un ique ly .  A set of at most 
16 characters  are d i sp layed  on a CRT, 
f rom wh ich  the operator  can then se lect  
the cor rec t  one. Accord ing  to /4/ this 
sys tem has been des igned  for 
fo re igners ,  who do 
Kan j i l  
not unders tand  
A .Kan j i  Data  Termina l .  In /2/ an 
input  a r rangement  is descr ibed ,  wh ich  
uses a pr in ted  character  sheet  and a 
super imposed  b inary  code f i lm sheet.  A 
character  is entered  by mov ing  a 
pantograph  lever  mechan ism car ry ing  a 
code reader  dev ice  onto the se lec ted  
character .  On push ing  a but ton the 
character  code is f l ashed  on a LED 
d isp lay  and read f rom the f i lm by an 
ar ray  of photo  t rans i s to rs .  
This  sys tem a l lows  to use two 
k inds  of Kan j i  character  boards  wi th  
d i f fe rent  character  a r rangements .  The 
numbers  of characters  in the two sets 
are 2 ,205 (Onkun- jun)  and 2,940 
(Bushu-Kakusu- jun)  respect ive ly .  
The Rand Tab let .  This  is a 
genera l  purpose  graph ic  input  dev ice  
deve loped  by the Rand Corp. The sys tem 
for Kanj i  input  a l lows  hand wr i t ten  
s t roke  sequences  to be drawn on the 
Tab le t ,  matched  wi th  a pat te rn  
d ic t ionary  and d i sp layed  on a CRT. The 
d i sadvantages  are: 
* The s low speed,  the amount  of 
manua l  e f fo r t  and d i f f i cu l ty  of 
cor rec t ly  d rawing  a character  
* The complex i ty  and inadequacy  
of pat te rn  match ing  procedures .  
Mach ine  recogn i t ion  of Kan j i  is 
not a so lu t ion  to on - l ine  Kan j i  input,  
because  the human e f fo r t  requ i red  to 
handwr i te  a character  is cons iderab ly  
g reater  than the e f fo r t  requ i red  to 
read it on the keyboard  and to type it. 
I f  this, as it is, the case w i th  the 
Roman le t te rs  and the Arab ic  numbers ,  
then let a lone wi th  Kanj i ,  whose  
ca l l ig raphy  is work  of art. 
A Pat te rn  S t ruc tura l  Cod ing  
Method .  In /8/ a method  is descr ibed ,  
wh ich  enab les  generat ive  descr ip t ion  
and de f in i t ion  of Kan j i  l ike pat te rns .  
The method  a l lows  sys temat ic  encod ing  
of an un l imi ted  set of pat te rns  in 
te rms  of a smal l  number  of

concatenat ion  operators .  D isadvantages  
of this method  are: 
* The need of long a lphanumer ic  
code s t r ings  for characters  
* Insu f f i c iency  of the cod ing  
sys tem to express  un ique  s t roke

Automat ic  Phonet ic  to Kan~i  
Convers ion .  severa l  sys tems have been 
deve loped  for automat ic  convers ion  of 
phonemic  Kana scr ipt  into  Kanj i .  These  
sys tems must rely on methods  of 
g rammat ica l  ana lys i s  of the phonemic  
scr ip t .  Re ference  f i les  are necessary  
for the so lu t ion  of ambiqu i t ies .  The 
d i sadvantages  are: 
* The need of compl i ca ted  natura l  
language syntax  ana lys i s  a lgor i thms 
and large re ference  f i les 
* The inadequacy  of the a lgor i tms  
as to cor rec tness  of t rans la t ion .  
Bunka i -Hatsuon  Convers ion  Method.  
The sub jec t  of /4/ is a lso a convers ion  
method  f rom phonemic  scr ipt  to Kanj i .  
It makes use of the fact that many 
Kan j i  characters  have severa l  
p ronunc ia t ions .  These  can be used to 
reduce  the ambiqu i ty  in mapp ing  
phonemic  scr ipt  to KanJ i .  The method  
is ca l led  Bunka i -Hatsuon .  
Tests  and compar i sons  repor ted  in 
/4/ ind icate  that on the average  four 
key s t rokes  are adequate  to un ique ly  
ident i fy  a Kan j i  character  as opposed  
to six s t rokes  w~th the S inotype .  
Input  rates of 40 to 50 characters  per 
minute  have been ach ieved .  Accord ing  
to the authors  this is not fast enough 
for all purposes ,  but it sa t i s f ies  the 
requ i rements  for some man/computer  
communicat ion  needs and comes c lose to 
an "easy to use" system.  An advantage  
of this sys tem is that it can be used 
for any s ize of character  sets. The 
only  mod i f i ca t ion  requ i red  is t~ add 
the new Kanj i  characters  to the sys tem 
d ic t ionary .  The sys tem requ i res  an 
advanced computer  sys tem for its 
suppor t  (Tosbac 3400).  
Kanj i  Input  System.  A Kanj i  
keyboard  has been deve loped  in /7/, 
wh ich  enab les  incorporat ion  of 
nonstandard  characters  as wel l .  The 
keyboard  has in add i t ion  to the 
s tandard  keyboard  three spec ia l  
sec t ions .  These  are ca l led  Spare Area, 
Funct ion  Input and Pat tern  Input  
sect ions .  
On the Spare Area d i f fe rent  sets 
of characters  can be prov ided  by us ing  
rep laceab le  character  sheets  and 
funct ion  keys for sheet  ident i f i ca t ion .  
Customized  character  sets can be 
de f ined  for vary ing  app l i ca t ions .  
The Pat tern  Input  sect ion  enab les  
in t roduct ion  of new characters  to the 
system.  Character  pat terns  can be 
in teract ive ly  const ructed  from st rokes  
us ing  s ty lus  and a 64 by 64 point  grid. 
The generated  pat terns  are added to the 
reper to i re  of nonstandard  pat terns  and 
ass igned  wi th  a sheet  number  and key 
pos i t ion .  The de f ined  character  
pat tern  is then hand pr in ted  on the 
spec i f ied  pos i t ion  of the sheet to 
enab le  se lec t ion .  When entered,  any 
character  can be d i sp layed  for 
ver i f i ca t ion  by the operator .  
In p r inc ip le  the sys tem can hand le  
an un l imi ted  number  of Kan j i  
characters ,  but its operat ion  is 
obv ious ly  qu i te  impract i ca l .  In 
add i t ion  it also requ i res  a 
cons iderab le  computer  sys tem (NEAC 
2200/200)  for its support .  
The method  descr ibed  above is in 
p r inc ip le  s imi la r  to that used in some 
programmable  te rmina ls  and pocket  
ca lcu la tors ,  in wh ich  the user can 
de f ine  var ious  funct ions ,  ass ign  them 
to spec ia l  funct ion  keys and label  them 
by handpr in t ing  on over lay  sheets  
accord ing ly .  This  comes c lose to the 
idea of a p rogrammable  d i sp lay  key, in 
wh ich  not only the funct ion ,  but a lso 
its label  is s to red  in the memory  and 
d isp layed  to the user  for re fe rence  at 
p rogram cont ro l .  
The Soft  D isp lay  Key Pr inc ip le  
We now conf ine  ourse lves  to 
suggest ing  a method  for Kanj i  input,  
wh ich  is based on the programmable  
d i sp lay  key concept .  The d i sp lay  key, 
a lso  re fer red  to as v ideoc lav is  in /11/ 
- can be thought  of as a normal  input  
key, but wi th  the d i f fe rence  that its 
key top capt ion,  ins tead  of be ing 
engraved ,  pa in ted  or o therw ise  made and 
f ixed  permanent ly  on the key, is now 
generated  by a d i sp lay  component  under  
program contro l .  The character  images  
are s tored in memory,  e i ther  read only 
or renewab le ,  and presented  to the user 
for re fe rence  as appropr ia te .  At any 
sys tem state only a re levant  set of 
symbo ls  or words  are d i sp layed  as a 
menu.  At the touch of a d i sp lay  key, 
the who le  setup, some part  of it or 
noth ing  at all may change accord ing  to 
how that step had been programmed.  
Though s imple  in p r inc ip le  this is 
a brave idea promis ing  to upset  p resent  
concept ions  about  keyboard  and panel  
a r rangements  as wel l  as the pr inc ip les  
of man/computer  in ter face  des ign.  
Conceptua l ly  the soft d i sp lay  key 
--291--- 
is re la ted  to the touch sens i t i ve  
sc reen  /10/. The la t ter  makes the 
d i sp lay  sc reen  also an input  device,  
wh i le  the fo rmer  makes the keyboard  
a lso  an output  device.  Both a l low to 
improve  the man/computer  in teract ion  by 
o f fe r ing  a fu l ly  v i r tua l  human 
in ter face .  
As app l ied  to Kanj i  input,  the 
main  advantage  of the v i r tua l  in ter face  
is that the keyboard  equ ipment  becomes  
independent  of the s ize of the 
character  set. Consequent ly  the s ize 
of the keyboard  can be reduced  to what 
is cons idered  most su i tab le  f rom 
operat ing  and manufactur ing  po ints  of 
view. 
In add i t ion ,  the very same 
keyboard  can be equa l ly  wel l  used for 
H i ragana ,  Katakana ,  Lat in,  Cyr i l l i c  or 
whatever  character  set is needed.  Very 
la rge  character  sets such as Kanj i ,  
must  be s t ruc tured  in some way so as to 
a l low qu ick  access  to the a imed 
character .  This can be done by 
break ing  the set down into subsets  by 
an  appropr ia te  scheme.  Features  such 
as subarea  on a t rad i t iona l  keyboard ,  
phonet ic  order,  s t roke number ,  rad ica l  
component ,  wr i t ing  sequence ,  
g rammat ica l  or semant ic  category  or 
perhaps  st i l l  o ther  character i s t i cs ,  
wh ich  a European,  only super f i c ia l l y  
fami l ia r  wi th  Kanj i ,  cannot  imag ine  of. 
A tree l ike access  s t ruc ture  wi th  
equa l ly  s ized and appropr ia te ly  named 
subd i rec tor ies  wou ld  guarantee  most 
e f f i c ient  access  path. Actua l  
character i s t i cs  of Kanj i  and learned  
convent ions  may suggest  d i f fe rences  to 
obta in  a most p ract i ca l  access  scheme. 
The input d i sp lay  pr inc ip le  is a 
very genera l  idea and its essent ia l  
funct ions  can be rea l i zed  by us ing 
a l te rnat ive  techno log ies  ava i lab le  for 
d i sp lay  and sen~ing.  S imi la r ly  both 
hardware  and so f tware  suppor t  sys tems 
a l low great  f reedom of des ign dec is ion .  
D isp lay  techno log ies  are becoming  
ava i lab le ,  wh ich  a l low fabr ica t ion  of 
compos i te  mat r ix  e lement  d i sp lay  
s t ruc tures  su f f i c ient  for the 
reso lu t ion  requ i red  by Kanj i .  The 
d i sp lay  component  may be based on l ight  
emi t t ing  diode (LED), l iqu id  chrys ta l  
d i sp lay  (LCD), e lectr~luminence (EL) or 
o ther  f lat panel  d i sp lay  techno logy .  
Var ious  techno log ies  are also 
ava i lab le  for imp lementat ion  of the 
sw i tch ing  f ie ld necessary  for sens ing  
the presence  of a f inger  on some 
d isp lay  area. The sw i tch ing  funct ion  
can be based on contact ive ,  capac i t ive  
or res i s t ive  ef fect ,  photo  detect ion ,  
acust i c  s igna l  etc. sw i tch ing  
components .  
The sw i tch ing  sys tem can e i ther  be 
in tegrated  into the d i sp lay  sys tem or 
over la id  to it. On the panel  s ide the 
two sys tems are, however ,  independent  
of each other.  They are oniy 
coord inated  wi th  each other  with 
respect  to locat ion .  On the sys tem 
s ide they are assoc ia ted  wi th  each 
o ther  under  common program contro l .  
The d i scuss ion  of both techn ica l  
des ign  ob jec t ives  as wel l  as spec i f i c  
app l i ca t ions  would,  however ,  invo lve  
exper t  knowhow of both d i sp lay  
e lec t ron ics  as wel l  as Kanj i  scr ipt ,  
the Japanese  language,  type of 
app l i ca t ion ,  user  env i ronment  etc that 
we do not possess .  The i r  d i scusss ion  
must  there fore  lie outs ide  of the scope 
of this paper.  The aim of this talk 
has only been to demonst ra te  the 
feas ib i l i ty  of the idea and to point  
out some of its imp l i ca t ions .  
Some Impl i ca t ions  
A number  of key prob lems invo lved  
in Kanj i  input  dev ices  and the i r  use 
seem to f ind the i r  so lu t ion  in the soft 
d i sp lay  key input p r inc ip le .  The major  
p rob lems so lved and advantages  ach ieved  
are as fo l lows:  
* The number  of keys and the s ize 
of the keyboard  can be reduced  
to what is cons idered  normal  
* ~et normal  key and character  s ize 
can be mainta ined  for good leg ib -  
i l i ty  and conven ient  operat ion  
* An un l imi ted  number  of Kanj i  
characters  can be accommodated  
* New characters  can be added by 
de f in i t ion  as necessary  
* The character  set can be adapted  
or changed from one app l i ca t ion  
to another  
The character  layout  can be 
changed from one convent ion  to 
another  accord ing  to user  ski l l  
* The same keyboard  can be used 
for Kana, ASCI I  and st i l l  other  
character  sets when necessary  
at the same t ime 
- 292- -  
* The keyboard  can also be used 
for user  in teract ion  such as 
prompt ing ,  ind icat ion ,  etc 
Mov ing  mechan ica l  parts  can be 
fu l ly  e l im inated  and all keys 
can be made ident ica l  to a l low 
cost e f f i c ient  mass product ion .  
Opt ima l  Key and Keyboard  Size. 
The keyboard  can be des igned  into 
opt ima l  s ize f rom manufactur ing  and 
human fac tors  po in ts  of view. Yet the 
key and character  s ize can be made 
large enough for good leg ib i l i ty  and 
conven ient  ac tuat ion  by bare f inger .  
The need for spec ia l  a r rangements  
for nonstandard  characters  and 
ver i f i ca t ion  of entered  characters  
becomes  unnecessary .  
V i r tua l  Character  Sets.  Through 
menu s t ruc tur ing  and pag ing  an 
un l imi ted  number  of characters  can be 
suppor ted  independent ly  of the number  
of phys ica l  d i sp lay  key f ie lds.  It 
becomes  poss ib le  to use d i f fe rent  s ize 
keyboards  for a g iven character  set and 
d i f fe rent  character  sets for a g iven 
s ize keyboard .  The only l im i t ing  
fac tors  are memory  space and d isp lay  
ras ter  reso lu t ion .  New characters  can 
be added to the sys tem by programmed 
def in i t ion  or by load ing  f rom externa l  
media .  
Por tab i l i ty  'and Adaptab i l i ty .  
So f tware  por tab i l i ty  and adaptab i l i ty  
are qua l i t ies ,  wh ich  re f lec t  the ease 
of mov ing  programs from one hardware  
env i ronment  to another  and mod i fy ing  
them to fit d i f fe rent  ob jec t ives  /15/. 
The programmed key labe l l ing  pr inc ip le  
a l lows  these qua l i t ies  to be extended 
to the man/computer  in ter face .  
Character  set dev ice  independence  
prov ides  for a capab i l i ty ,  wh ich  can be 
ca l led  human in ter face  por tab i l i ty .  
Th is  means that a character  set layout  
and menu s t ruc ture  can be t rans fer red  
f rom one keyboard  to another  s imply  as 
a so f tware  copy. If not d i rec t ly  
compat ib le ,  the convers ion  can be made 
on so f tware  level .  This  qua l i ty  does 
cont r ibute  to reduced  need of operator  
re t ra in ing  and h igher  equ ipment  
usab i l i ty .  
Adap.tabi l i t~. The need for 
adaptab i l i ty  emerges  f rom sys tem 
dependence  on the app l i ca t ion  and user 
env i ronment .  Sys tem adaptab i l i ty  
reduces  this dependence  and extends  the 
scope of potent ia l  sys tem app l i ca t ion .  
The d isp lay  key concept  does not 
e l im inate  var ia t ion  or incompat ib i l i ty  
among d i f fe rent  app l i ca t ion  or user  
env i ronments ,  but it a l lows the sys tem 
user  in ter face  to be adapted  toand 
compl ied  wi th  the d i f fe rent  convent ions  
and requ i tements  by mod i f i ca t ion  and 
ad jus tment  of the so f tware .  Even minor  
operator  p re ferences  and hab i tuat ions  
can be accommodated  eas i ly .  In many 
app l i ca t ion  env i ronments  cons iderab le  
sav ings  could be ach ieved,  if 
cus tomizat ion  and deve lopment  could be 
fu r ther  done by the user  a long with  his 
deve lop ing  exper ience .  The v i r tua l  
in ter face  does a l low such deve lopment .  
Un i f ied  Hardware .  In sp i te  of all 
the f lex ib i l i ty  and var ia t ion  it is 
poss ib le  to deve lop  un i f ied  d i sp lay  key 
component  des igns  and to s tandard ize  
the panel  and keyboard  s t ruc tures  for 
cost  e f fec t ive  mass product ion .
