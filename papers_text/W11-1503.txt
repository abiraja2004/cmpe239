Abstract
The goal of this study is to evaluate an ?off-
the-shelf? POS-tagger for modern German on
historical data from the Early Modern period
(1650-1800). With no specialised tagger avail-
able for this particular stage of the language,
our findings will be of particular interest to
smaller, humanities-based projects wishing to
add POS annotations to their historical data
but which lack the means or resources to train
a POS tagger themselves. Our study assesses
the effects of spelling variation on the perfor-
mance of the tagger, and investigates to what
extent tagger performance can be improved by
using ?normalised? input, where spelling vari-
ants in the corpus are standardised to a mod-
ern form. Our findings show that adding such
a normalisation layer improves tagger perfor-
mance considerably.
1 Introduction
The work described in this paper is part of a larger
investigation whose goal is to create a representative
corpus of Early Modern German from 1650-1800.
The GerManC corpus, which is due to be completed
this summer, was developed to allow for compara-
tive studies of the development and standardisation
of English and German in the 17th and 18th cen-
turies. In order to facilitate corpus-linguistic inves-
tigations, one of the major goals of the project is
to annotate the corpus with POS tags. However,
no specialised tools are yet available for process-
ing data from this period. The goal of this study is
therefore to evaluate the performance of an ?off-the-
shelf? POS-tagger for modern German on data from
the Early Modern period, in order to assess if mod-
ern tools are suitable for a semi-automatic approach,
and how much manual post-processing work would
be necessary to obtain gold standard POS annota-
tions.
We report on our results of running the TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994) on a subcorpus of GerManC
containing over 50,000 tokens of text annotated with
gold standard POS tags. This subcorpus is the first
resource of its kind for this variant of German, and
due to its complex structure it represents an ideal test
bed for evaluating and adapting existing NLP tools
on data from the Early Modern period. The study
described in this paper represents a first step towards
this goal. Furthermore, as spelling variants in our
corpus have been manually normalised to a modern
standard, this paper also aims to explore the extent
to which tagger performance is affected by spelling
variation, and to what degree performance can be
improved by using ?normalised? input. Our findings
promise to be of considerable interest to other cur-
rent corpus-based projects of earlier periods of Ger-
man (Jurish, 2010; Fasshauer, 2011; Dipper, 2010).
Before presenting the results in Section 4, we de-
scribe the corpus design (Section 2), and the prepro-
cessing steps necessary to create the gold standard
annotations, including adaptations to the POS tagset
(Section 3).
2 Corpus design
In order to be as representative of Early Modern Ger-
man as possible, the GerManC corpus design con-
siders three different levels. First, the corpus in-
cludes a range of text types: four orally-oriented
19
genres (dramas, newspapers, letters, and sermons),
and four print-oriented ones (narrative prose, and
humanities, scientific, and legal texts). Secondly, in
order to enable historical developments to be traced,
the period is divided into three fifty year sections
(1650-1700, 1700-1750, and 1750-1800). Finally,
the corpus also aims to be representative with re-
spect to region, including five broad areas: North
German, West Central, East Central, West Upper
(including Switzerland), and East Upper German
(including Austria). Three extracts of around 2000
words were selected per genre, period, and region,
yielding a corpus size of nearly a million words.
The experiments described in this paper were car-
ried out on a manually annotated gold standard sub-
corpus of GerManC, GerManC-GS. The subcorpus
was developed to enable an assessment of the suit-
ability of existing NLP tools on historical data, with
a view to adapting them to improve their perfor-
mance. For this reason, GerManC-GS aims to be as
representative of the main corpus as possible. How-
ever, to remain manageable in terms of annotation
times and cost, the subcorpus only considers two
of the three corpus variables, ?genre? and ?time?, as
they alone were found to display as much if not more
variation than ?region?. GerManC-GS thus includes
texts from the North German region, with one sam-
ple file per genre and time period. The corpus con-
tains 57,845 tokens in total, and was annotated with
gold standard POS tags, lemmas, and normalised
word forms (Scheible et al, to appear).
3 Creating the gold standard annotations
This section provides an overview of the preprocess-
ing work necessary to obtain the gold standard an-
notations in GerManC-GS. We used the GATE plat-
form to produce the initial annotations, which facil-
itates automatic as well as manual annotation (Cun-
ningham et al, 2002). First, GATE?s German Lan-
guage plugin1 was used to obtain word tokens and
sentence boundaries. The output was manually in-
spected and corrected by one annotator, who fur-
ther added a layer of normalised spelling variants.
This annotation layer was then used as input for the
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), obtaining annotations
in terms of POS tags and lemmas. All annotations

were subsequently corrected by two annotators, and
disagreements were reconciled to produce the gold
standard.
3.1 Tokenisation
As German orthography was not yet codified in the
Early Modern period, a number of specific deci-
sions had to be made in respect of tokenisation. For
example, clitics can occur in various non-standard
forms. To allow for accurate POS tagging, clitics
should be tokenised as separate items, similar to the
negative particle n?t in can?t in English, which is
conventionally tokenised as ca|n?t. A case in point
is hastu, a clitic version of hast du (?have you?),
which we tokenise as has|tu. Furthermore, Ger-
man ?to-infinitive? verb forms are often directly ap-
pended to the infinitival marker zu without interven-
ing whitespace (e.g. zugehen instead of zu gehen,
?to go?). Such cases are tokenised as separate forms
(zu|gehen) to allow for their accurate tagging as
zu/PTKZU gehen/VVINF.
A further problem can be found in multi-word
tokens, where the same expression is sometimes
treated as a compound (e.g. obgleich), but at other
times written separately (ob gleich). Such cases rep-
resent a problem for POS-tagging as the variants
have to be treated differently even though their func-
tion in the sentence is the same. Our tokenisation
scheme deals with these in a similar way to nor-
mal conjunctions consisting of two words, where
the most suitable tags are assigned to each token
(e.g. als/KOKOM wenn/KOUS). Thus, the com-
pound obgleich is tagged KOUS, while the multi-
word variant ob gleich is tagged as ob/KOUS gle-
ich/ADV.
3.2 Normalising spelling variants
All spelling variants in GerManC-GS were nor-
malised to a modern standard. We view the task
of normalising spelling variation as a type of pre-
lemmatisation, where each word token occurring
in a text is labelled with a normalised head vari-
ant. As linguistic searches require a historically ac-
curate treatment of spelling variation, our scheme
has a preference for treating two seemingly simi-
lar tokens as separate items on historical grounds
(e.g. etwan vs. etwa). On the other hand, the
scheme normalises variants to a modernised form
20
even where the given lexical item has since died out
(e.g. obsolete verbs ending in -iren are normalised
to -ieren), in order to support automatic tools using
morphological strategies such as suffix probabilities
(Schmid, 1994). Inter-annotator agreement for an-
notating spelling variation was 96.9%, which indi-
cates that normalisation is a relatively easy task.
Figure 1 shows the proportion of normalised word
tokens in the individual corpus files plotted against
time. The graph clearly shows a decline of spelling
variants over time: while the earlier texts contain 35-
40% of normalised tokens, the proportion is lower
in later texts (11.3% in 1790, and 5.4% in 1798).
This suggests that by the end of the period (1800)
codification of the German language was already at
an advanced stage.

against time)
3.3 Adapting the POS tagset (STTS)
To account for important differences between mod-
ern and Early Modern German (EMG), and to facil-
itate more accurate searches, we adapted the STTS
tagset (Schiller et al, 1999). The STTS-EMG tagset
merges two categories, as the criteria for distinguish-
ing them are not applicable in EMG (1.), and pro-
vides a number of additional ones to account for spe-
cial EMG constructions (2. to 6.):
1. PIAT (merged with PIDAT): Indefinite de-
terminer, as in ?viele solche Bemerkungen?
(?many such remarks?)
2. NA: Adjectives used as nouns, as in ?der
Gesandte? (?the ambassador?)
3. PAVREL: Pronominal adverb used as relative,
as in ?die Puppe, damit sie spielt? (?the doll
with which she plays?)
4. PTKREL: Indeclinable relative particle, as in
?die Fa?lle, so aus Schwachheit entstehen? (?the
cases which arise from weakness?)
5. PWAVREL: Interrogative adverb used as
relative, as in ?der Zaun, woru?ber sie springt?
(?the fence over which she jumps?)
6. PWREL: Interrogative pronoun used as rel-
ative, as in ?etwas, was er sieht? (?something
which he sees?)
Around 2.0% (1132) of all tokens in the corpus
were tagged with one of the above POS categories.
Inter-annotator agreement for the POS tagging task
was 91.6%.
4 ?Off-the-shelf? tagger evaluation on
Early Modern German data
The evaluation described in this section aims to
complement the findings of Rayson et al (2007) for
Early Modern English, and a recent study by Dip-
per (2010), in which the TreeTagger is applied to a
corpus of texts from Middle High German (MHG)
- i.e. a period earlier than ours, from 1050-1350.
Both studies report considerable improvement of
POS-tagging accuracy on normalised data. How-
ever, unlike Dipper (2010), whose experiments in-
volve retraining the TreeTagger on a modified ver-
sion of STTS, our experiments assess the ?off-the-
shelf? performance of the modern tagger on histor-
ical data. We further explore the question of what
effect spelling variation has on the performance of a
tagger, and what improvement can be achieved when
running the tool on normalised data.
Table 1 shows the results of running the Tree-
Tagger on the original data vs. normalised data in
our corpus using the parameter file for modern Ger-
man supplied with the tagger2. The results show that
while overall accuracy for running the tagger on the
original input is relatively low at 69.6%, using the
normalised tokens as input results in an overall im-
provement of 10% (79.7%).

malised (N) input
However, improvement through normalisation is
not distributed evenly across the corpus. Figure 2
shows the performance curves of using TreeTagger
on original (O) and normalised (N) input plotted
against publication date. While both curves grad-
ually rise over time, the improvement curve (mea-
sured as difference in accuracy between N and O)
diminishes, a direct result of spelling variation be-
ing more prominent in earlier texts (cf. Figure 1).
Figure 2: Tagger performance plotted against publication
date
Compared with the performance of the TreeTag-
ger on modern data (ca. 97%; Schmid, (1995)), the
current results seem relatively low. However, two is-
sues should be taken into account when interpreting
these findings: First, the modern accuracy figures
result from an evaluation of the tagger on the text
type it was developed on (newspaper text), while
GerManC-GS includes a variety of genres, which
is bound to result in lower performance. Secondly,
inter-annotator agreement was also found to be con-
siderably lower in the present task (91.6%) than in
one reported for modern German (98.6%; Brants,
2000a). This is likely to be due to the large number
of unfamiliar word forms and variants in the corpus,
which represent a problem for human annotators.
Finally, Figure 3 provides a more detailed
overview of the effects of spelling variation on POS
tagger performance. Of 12,744 normalised tokens in
the corpus, almost half (5981; 47%) are only tagged
correctly when using the normalised variants as in-
put. Using the original word form as input results
in a false POS tag in these cases. Overall, this ac-
counts for an improvement of around 10.3% (5981
out of 57,845 tokens in the corpus). However, 32%
(4119) of normalised tokens are tagged correctly us-
ing both N and O input, while 18% (2339) of to-
kens are tagged incorrectly using both types of input.
This means that for 50% of all annotated spelling
variants, normalisation has no effect on POS tagger
performance. In a minority of cases (305; 3%) nor-
malisation has a negative effect on tagger accuracy.

put on tagger accuracy for normalised tokens (+: cor-
rectly tagged; -: incorrectly tagged)
5 Conclusion and future work
The results of our study show that using an ?off-the
shelf? German POS tagger on data from the Early
Modern period achieves reasonable results (69.6%
on average), but requires a substantial amount of
manual post-editing. We further demonstrated that
adding a normalisation layer can improve results by
10%. However, using the current manual normalisa-
tion scheme only half of all annotations carried out
have a positive effect on tagger performance. In fu-
ture work we plan to investigate if the scheme can
be adapted to account for more cases, and to what
extent normalisation can be reliably automated (Jur-
ish, 2010). Finally, we plan to retrain state-of-the-art
POS taggers such as the TreeTagger and TnT Tagger
(Brants, 2000b) on our data and compare the results
to the findings of this study.
