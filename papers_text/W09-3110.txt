Abstract
We present in this paper the development
of a specialized comparable corpora com-
pilation tool, for which quality would be
close to a manually compiled corpus. The
comparability is based on three levels: do-
main, topic and type of discourse. Domain
and topic can be filtered with the keywords
used through web search. But the detec-
tion of the type of discourse needs a wide
linguistic analysis. The first step of our
work is to automate the detection of the
type of discourse that can be found in a
scientific domain (science and popular sci-
ence) in French and Japanese languages.
First, a contrastive stylistic analysis of the
two types of discourse is done on both lan-
guages. This analysis leads to the creation
of a reusable, generic and robust typology.
Machine learning algorithms are then ap-
plied to the typology, using shallow pars-
ing. We obtain good results, with an av-
erage precision of 80% and an average re-
call of 70% that demonstrate the efficiency
of this typology. This classification tool
is then inserted in a corpus compilation
tool which is a text collection treatment
chain realized through IBM UIMA system.
Starting from two specialized web docu-
ments collection in French and Japanese,
this tool creates the corresponding corpus.
1 Introduction
Comparable corpora are sets of texts in differ-
ent languages, that are not translations, but share
some characteristics (Bowker and Pearson, 2002).
They represent useful resources from which are
extracted multilingual terminologies (D?jean et
al., 2002) or multilingual lexicons (Fung and Yee,
1998). Comparable corpora are also used in
contrastive multilingual studies framework (Peters
and Picchi, 1997), they constitute a precious re-
source for translators (Laviosa, 1998) and teachers
(Zanettin, 1998), as they provide a way to observe
languages in use.
Their compilation is easier than parallel corpora
compilation, because translated resources are rare
and there is a lack of resources when the languages
involved do not include English. Furthermore, the
amount of multilingual documents available on the
Web ensures the possibility of automatically com-
piling them. Nevertheless, this task can not be
summarized to a simple collection of documents
sharing vocabulary. It is necessary to respect the
common characteristics of texts in corpora, es-
tablished before the compilation, according to the
corpus finality (McEnery and Xiao, 2007). Many
works are about compilation of corpora from the
Web (Baroni and Kilgarriff, 2006) but none, in our
knowledge, focuses on compilation of compara-
ble corpora, which has to satisfy many constraints.
We fix three comparability levels: domain, topic
and type of discourse. Our goal is to automate
recognition of these comparability levels in docu-
ments, in order to include them into a corpus. We
work on Web documents on specialized scientific
domains in French and Japanese languages. As
document topics can be filtered with keywords in
the Web search (Chakrabarti et al, 1999), we fo-
cus in this paper on automatic recognition of types
of discourse that can be found in scientific docu-
ments: science and popular science. This classi-
fication tool is then inserted in a specialized com-
parable corpora compilation tool, which is devel-
opped through the Unstructured Information Man-
55
agement Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally,
2004).
This paper is structured as follows. After an in-
troduction of related works in section 2, stylistic
analysis of our corpus will be presented in sec-
tion 3. This analysis will lead to the creation of
a typology of scientific and popular science dis-
course type in specifialized domains. The appli-
cation of learning algorithms to the typology will
be described in section 4, and the results will be
presented in section 5. We will show that our ty-
pology, based on linguistically motivated features,
can characterize science and popular science dis-
courses in French and Japanese documents, and
that the use of our three comparablility levels can
improve corpora comparability. Finally, we de-
scribe the development of the corpus compilation
tool.
2 Background
?A comparable corpus can be defined as a corpus
containing components that are collected using
the same sampling frame and similar balance and
representativeness? (McEnery and Xiao, 2007, p.
20). Comparability is ensured using character-
istics which can refer to the text creation con-
text (period, author...), or to the text itself (topic,
genre...). The choice of the common characteris-
tics, which define the content of corpora, affects
the degree of comparability, notion used to quan-
tify how two corpora can be comparable. The
choice of these characteristics depends on the fi-
nality of the corpus. Among papers on comparable
corpora, we distinguish two types of works, which
induces different choices:
? General language works, where texts of cor-
pora usually share a domain and a period.
Fung and Yee (1998) used a corpus composed
of newspaper in English and Chinese on a
specific period to extract words translations,
using IR and NLP methods. Rapp (1999)
used a English / German corpus, composed of
documents coming from newspapers as well
as scientific papers to study alignment meth-
ods and bilingual lexicon extraction from
non-parallel corpora (which can be consid-
ered as comparable);
? Specialized language works, where choice of
criteria is various. D?jean et al (2002) used a
corpus composed of scientific abstracts from
Medline, a medical portal, in English and
German. Thus they used documents sharing a
domain and a genre to extract bilingual termi-
nology. Chiao (2002) used a corpus of docu-
ments of medical domain on a specific topic
to work on the extraction of specialized ter-
minologies.
In general language works, documents of compa-
rable corpora often share characteristics like do-
main or topic. As they are usually extracted from
newspapers, it is important to limit them to a cer-
tain period to guarantee their comparability.
In specialized corpora, first levels of compara-
bility can be achieved with the domain and the
topic. Moreover, several communicative settings
appear in specialized language (Bowker and Pear-
son, 2002): expert-expert, expert-initiate, relative
expert to the uninitiated, teacher-pupil. Malrieu
and Rastier (2002) specify several levels of tex-
tual classification, each of which corresponding to
a certain granularity. The first level is discourse,
defined as a set of utterances from a enunciator
characterized by a global topical unit (Ducrot and
Todorov, 1972). The second level is genre, de-
fined as text categories distinguished by matured
speakers. For example, to literary discourse corre-
spond several genres: drama, poetry, prose. . . In-
spired by these communicative settings and tex-
tual categories, we choose to distinguish two com-
municative settings or type of discourse in spe-
cialized domains: science (texts written by ex-
perts to experts) and popular science (texts written
to non-experts, by experts, semi-experts or non-
experts). This comparability level, the type of dis-
course, reflects the context of production or usage
of the documents, and guarantees a lexical homo-
geneity in corpora (Bowker and Pearson, 2002, p.
27). Furthermore, Morin et al (2007) proved that
comparable corpora sharing a topic and a type of
discourse are well adapted for multilingual termi-
nologies extraction.
Our goal is to create a tool to compile compa-
rable corpora in French and Japanese which docu-
ments are extracted from the Web. We investigate
automatic categorization of documents according
to their type of discourse. This categorization is
based on a typology of elements characterizing
these types of discourse. To this end, we carry
out a stylistic and contrastive analysis (Karlgren,
1998). This analysis aims to highlight linguis-
tically motivated features through several dimen-
56
sions (structural, modal and lexical), whose com-
bination characterizes scientific or popular science
discourse. A specialized comparable corpus can
be compiled from a single type of discourse docu-
ment collection through several steps. Last part of
this paper focuses on the automation of these steps
using the IBM Unstructured Information Manage-
ment Architecture (UIMA).
3 Analysis of Types of Discourse
The recognition of types of discourse is based
on a stylistic analysis adapted from a deductive
and contrastive method, which purpose is to raise
discriminant and linguistically motivated features
characterizing these two types of discourse. Main
difficulty here is to find relevant features which fit
every language involved. These features, gathered
in a typology, will be used to adapt machine learn-
ing algorithms to compilation of corpora. This
typology thus needs to be robust, generic and
reusable in other languages and domains. Gener-
icity is ensured by a broad typology composed of
features covering a wide range of documents char-
acteristics, while robustness is guaranteed with
operational (computable) features and treatment
adaptable to Web documents as well as texts.
Sinclair (1996) distinguishes two levels of anal-
ysis in his report on text typologies: external level,
characterizing the context of creation of the docu-
ment; and internal level, corresponding to linguis-
tic characteristics of document. Because our cor-
pora are composed of documents extracted from
the Web, we consider external level features as
all the features related to the creation of docu-
ments and their structure (non-linguistic features)
and call them structural features. Stylistic analy-
sis raises several granularity levels among linguis-
tic characteristics of the texts. We thus distinguish
two levels in the internal dimension. Firstly, in
order to distinguish between scientific and pop-
ular science documents, we need to consider the
speaker in his speech: the modality. Secondly, sci-
entific discourse can be characterized by vocabu-
lary, word length and other lexical features. There-
fore our typology is based on three analysis levels:
structural, modal and lexical.
3.1 Structural Dimension
When documents are extracted from the Web, the
structure and the context of creation of the doc-
uments should be considered. In the framework

Table 1: Structural dimension features
of Web documents classification, several elements
bring useful information: pictures, videos and
other multimedia contents (Asirvatham and Ravi,
2001); meta-information, title and HTML struc-
ture (Riboni, 2002). While those information are
not often used in comparable corpora, they can be
used to classify them. Table 1 shows structural
features.
3.2 Modal Dimension
The degree of specialization required by the recip-
ient or reader is characterized by the relation built
in the utterance between the speaker or author and
the recipient or reader1. The tone and linguistic
elements in texts define this relation. The modal-
isation is an interpretation of the author?s attitude
toward the content of his/her assertion. Modali-
sation is characterized by many textual markers:
verbs, adverbs, politeness forms, etc. Presence of
the speaker and his position towards his speech
are quite different in scientific and popular science
discourse. Thus we think modalisation markers
can be relevant. For example, the speaker directly
speaks to the reader in some popular science doc-
uments: ?By eating well, you?ll also help to pre-
vent diabetes problems that can occur later in life,
like heart disease?. Whereas a scientific document
would have a neutral tone: ?Obesity plays a cen-
tral role in the insulin resistance syndrome, which
includes hyperinsulinemia, [. . . ] and an increased
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?.
Most of the modal theories are language de-
pendent, and use description phenomena that are
specific to each language. Conversely, the theory
exposed in (Charaudeau, 1992) is rather indepen-
1Since we work on a scientific domain, we will consider
the speaker as the author of texts, and the recipient as the
reader.
57
dent of the language and operational for French
and Japanese (Ishimaru, 2006). According to Cha-
raudeau (1992, p.572), modalisation clarifies the
position of the speaker with respect to his reader,
to himself and to his speech. Modalisation is com-
posed of locutive acts, particular positions of the
author in his speech, and each locutive act is char-
acterized by modalities. We kept in his theory two
locutive acts involving the author:
Allocutive act: the author gets the reader in-
volved in the speech (ex.: ?You have to do
this.?);
Elocutive act: the author is involved in his own
speech, he reveals his position regarding his
speech (ex.: ?I would like to do this.?).
Each of these acts are then divided into several
modalities. These modalities are presented in ta-
ble 2 with English examples. Some of the modali-
ties are not used in a language or another, because
they are not frequent or too ambiguous.
3.3 Lexical Dimension
Biber (1988) uses lexical information to observe
variations between texts, especially between gen-
res and types of texts. Karlgren (1998) also use
lexical information to characterize text genres, and
use them to observe stylistic variations among
texts. Thus, we assume that lexical information
is relevant in the distinction between science and
popular science discourse. Firstly, because a spe-
cialized vocabulary is a principal characteristic of
specialized domain texts (Bowker and Pearson,
2002, p. 26). Secondly, because scientific docu-
ments contain more complex lexical units, nomi-
nal compounds or nominal sentences than popular
science documents (Sager, 1990).
Table 3 presents the lexical dimension features.
Note that these features show a higher language
dependency than other dimension features.
4 Automatic Classification by Type of
Discourse
The process of documents classification can be di-
vided into three steps: document indexing, classi-
fier learning and classifier evaluation (Sebastiani,
2002). Document indexing consists in building
a compact representation of documents that can
be interpreted by a classifier. In our case, each
document di is represented as a vector of fea-
tures weight: ~di = {w1i, . . . , wni} where n is the

by our typology (section 3) and features imple-
mentation.
4.1 Features Implementation
In order to get a fast classification system, we priv-
ileged for the implementation of our typology fea-
tures shallow parsing such as lexical markers and
lexico-syntactic patterns (method for each dimen-
sion is detailed in table 4).
Structural Features We used 12 structural fea-
tures introduced in section 3.1. Most of these fea-
tures are achieved through pattern matching. For
example, URL patterns can determine is the docu-
ment belongs to websites such as hospital (http:
//www.chu-***.fr) or universities websites
(http://www.univ-***.fr), etc. As for
paragraphs, images, links, etc., one simple search
of HTML tags was made.
Modal Features Locutor presence markers in
a text can be implicit or ambiguous. We fo-
cused here on simple markers of his presence in
order to avoid noise in our results (high preci-
sion but weak recall). Thus we don?t recognize
all modal markers in a text but those recognized
are correct. There are pronouns which are spe-
cific to the speech act: for instance, for the eloc-
utive act, the French pronouns je (I) and nous
(we), and the Japanese pronouns? (I),?? (we)

and ?? (we). The modalities are also com-
puted with lexical markers. For example, the
modality of knowledge can be detected in French
with verbs like savoir, conna?tre (know), and in
Japanese with the verb ?? (know), with po-
lite form ?????? and with neutral form
?????.
Lexical Features Some of our lexical criteria
are specific to the scientific documents, like bib-
liographies and bibliographic quotations, special-
ized vocabulary or the measurement units. To
measure the terminological density (proportion of
specialized vocabulary in the text) in French, we
evaluate terms with stems of Greek-Latin (Namer
and Baud, 2007) and suffix characters of rela-
tional adjectives that are particularly frequent in
scientific domains (Daille, 2000). We listed about
50 stems such as inter-, auto- or nano-, and the
10 relational suffixes such such as -ique or -al.
For Japanese, we listed prefix characteristics of
names of disease or symptoms (??? (congen-
ital), ???(hereditary), etc.). These stems can
be found in both type of discourse, but not in the
same proportions. Specialized terms are used in
both type of discourse in different ways. For ex-
ample, the term ?ovarectomie? (ovarectomy) can
be frequent in a scientific document and used once
in a popular science documents to explain it and
then replaced by ?ablation des ovaires? (ovary ab-
lation). Sentences end are specific ending particles
used in japanese, for example the particle? is of-
ten used at the end of an interrogative sentence.
4.2 Learning Algorithms
Classifier learning is a process which observes fea-
tures weight of documents classified in a class
c or c and determine characteristics that a new
document should have to be classified in one of
these two classes 2. Given a document indexing,
there are some well-known algorithms that can
achieve this process (neural network, Bayes clas-
sifiers, SVM, etc.) of which Sebastiani (2002) car-
ried out a research about the assemblage and com-
parison. Applied to a Reuters newswires corpus,
these techniques showed variable performances in
the usage level of supervised or unsupervised ap-
proaches, of the size of the corpus, of the number
of categories, etc. We decided to use SVMlight
(Joachims, 2002) and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), since
both of them seem to be the most appropriate to
our data (small corpora, binary classification, less
than 100 features).
5 Experiments
In this section, we describe the two comparable
corpora used and present the two experiments car-
ried out with each of them. The first compara-
ble corpus is used to train the classifier in order
to learn a classification model based on our typol-
ogy (i.e. training task). The second comparable
corpus is used to evaluate the impact of the clas-
sification model when applied on new documents
(i.e. evaluation task).
2This is the binary case. See (Sebastiani, 2002) for other
cases.
59
5.1 Comparable Corpora
The corpora used in our experiments are both
composed of French and Japanese documents har-
vested from the Web. The documents were taken
from the medical domain, within the topic of di-
abetes and nutrition for training task, and breast
cancer for the evaluation task. Document harvest-
ing was carried out with a domain-based search
and a manual selection. Documents topic is fil-
tered using keywords reflecting the specialized
domain: for example alimentation, diab?te and
ob?sit? 3 for French part and ??? and ?? 4
for the Japanese part of the training task corpus.
Those keywords are directly related to the topic or
they can be synonyms (found on thesaurus) or se-
mantically linked terms (found in Web documents
collected). Then the documents were manually se-
lected by native speakers of each language who are
not domain specialists, and classified with respect
to their type of discourse: science (SC) or pop-
ular science (PS). Manual classification is based
on the following heuristics, to decide their type of
discourse:
? A scientific document is written by special-
ists to specialists.
? We distinguish two levels of popular science:
texts written by specialists for the general
public and texts written by the general pub-
lic for the general public. Without distinction
of these last two levels, we privileged doc-
uments written by specialists, assuming that
they may be richer in content and vocabulary
(for example advices from a doctor would be
richer and longer than forum discussions).
Our manual classification is based on the two
previous heuristics, and endorsed by several em-
pirical elements: website?s origin, vocabulary
used, etc. The classification of ambiguous docu-
ments has been validated by linguists. A few doc-
uments for which it was difficult to decide on the
type of discourse, such as those written by peo-
ple whose specialist status was not clear, were not
retained.
We thus created two comparable corpora:
? [DIAB_CP] related to the topic of diabetes
and nutrition and used to train the classifier.
3nutrition, diabetes, and obesity
4diabetes and overweight
? [BC_CP] related to the topic of breast cancer
and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
classifier.
Table 5 shows the main features of each compa-
rable corpora: the number of documents, and the
number of words5 for each language and each type
of discourse.

5.2 Results
We present in this section two classification tasks:
? the first one consists in training and test-
ing classifiers with [DIAB_CP], using N-fold
cross validation method that consists in divid-
ing the corpus into n sub-samples of the same
size (we fix N = 5). Results are for 5 parti-
tioning on average;
? the second one consists in testing on [BC_CP]
the best classifier learned on [DIAB_CP], in
order to evaluate its impact on new docu-
ments.
Tables 6 and 7 show results of these two tasks.
On both table we present precision and recall
metrics with the two learning systems used. On
table 6, we can see that the results concerning
the French documents are quite satisfactory alto-
gether, with a recall on average of 87%, and a pre-
cision on average of 90% as for the classifier C4.5
(more than 215 documents are well classified from
248 French documents of [DIAB_CP]). The re-
sults of the classification in Japanese are also good
with the classifier C.4.5. More than 90% of doc-
uments are correctly classified, and the precision
reaches on average 80%. Some of the lower results
can be explained, especially in Japanese by the
high range of document genres in the corpus (re-
search papers, newspapers, scientific magazines,
recipes, job offers, forum discussions. . . ).

currences recognized by ChaSen (Matsumoto et al, 1999)

we note a decrease of the results with [BC_CP],
although results are still satisfactory. French doc-
uments are well classified whatever the classifier
is, with a precision higher than 75% and a recall
higher than 75%, which represent more than 70
well classified documents on 92. Japanese docu-
ments are well classified too, with 76% precision
and 77% recall on average, with 23 documents
wrong classified on 99. This classification model
is effective when it is applied to a different medi-
cal topic. This classification model seems efficient
to recognize scientific discourse from popular sci-
ence one in French and Japanese documents on a
particular topic.

6 Comparable Corpora Compilation
Tool
Compilation of a corpus, whatever type it is, is
composed of several steps.
1. Corpus Specifications: they must be defined
by the creator or user of the corpus. It in-
cludes decisions on its type, languages in-
volved, resources from which are extracted
documents, its size, etc. In the case of spe-
cialized comparable corpora, specifications
concern languages involved, size, resources
and documents domain, theme and type of
discourse. This step depends on the applica-
tive goals of the corpus and has to be done
carefully.
2. Documents Selection and Collection:
according to the resource, size and other
corpus criteria chosen during the first step,
documents are collected.
3. Documents Normalization and Annotation:
cleaning and linguistic treatments are applied
to documents in order to convert them into
raw texts and annotated texts.
4. Corpus Documentation: compilation of a
corpus that can be used in a durable way
must include this step. Documentation
of the corpus includes information about
the compilation (creator, date, method,
resources, etc.) and information about the
corpus documents. Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) standard has been created in order to
conserve in an uniformed way this kind of
information in a corpus 6.
A corpus quality highly depends on the first two
steps. Moreover, these steps are directly linked to
the creator use of the corpus. The first step must
be realized by the user to create an relevant corpus.
Although second step can be computerizable (Ro-
gelio Nazar and Cabr?, 2008), we choose to keep
it manual in order to guarantee corpus quality. We
decided to work on a system which realizes the
last steps, i.e. normalization, annotation and docu-
mentation, starting from a collection of documents
selected by a user.
Our tool has been developed on Unstructured
Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
that has been created by IBM Research Divi-
sion (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004). Unstructured
data (texts, images, etc.) collections can be eas-
ily treated on this platform and many libraries are
available. Our tool starts with a web documents or
texts collection and is composed of several com-
ponents realizing each part of the creation of the
corpus:
1. the collection is loaded and documents are
converted to texts (with conversion tools
from pdf or html to text mainly);
2. all texts are cleaned and normalized (noise
from the conversion is cleaned, all texts are
converted into the same encoding, etc.);
6http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml
61
3. a pre-syntactic treatment is applied on texts
(segmentation mainly) to prepare them for
the following step;
4. morphologic and morpho-syntactic tagging
tools are applied on the texts (Brill tagger
(Brill, 1994) and Flemm lemmer (Namer,
2000) for French texts, Chasen (Matsumoto
et al, 1999) for Japanese);
5. texts are classified according to their type
of discourse: we use here the most efficient
SVMlight classifier. In fact, two corpus are
created, on for each type of discourse, then
the user can choose one of them. A vecto-
rial representation of each document is com-
puted, then these vectors are classified with
the classifier selected.
6. documentation is produced for the corpus, a
certain amount of information are included
and they can be easily completed by the user.
In reality, this tool is more a compilation assis-
tant than a compilator. It facilitates the compila-
tion task: the user is in charge of the most im-
portant part of the compilation, but the technical
part (treatment of each document) is realized by
the system. This guarantee a high quality in the
corpus.
7 Conclusion
This article has described a first attempt of com-
piling smart comparable corpora. The quality is
close to a manually collected corpus, and the high
degree of comparability is guaranteed by a com-
mon domain and topic, but also by a same type of
discourse. In order to detect automatically some of
the comparability levels, we carried out a stylistic
and contrastive analysis and elaborated a typology
for the characterization of scientific and popular
science types of discourse on the Web. This typol-
ogy is based on three aspects of Web documents:
the structural aspect, the modal aspect and lexi-
cal aspect. From the modality part, this distinction
is operational even on linguistically distant lan-
guages, as we proved by the validation on French
and Japanese. Our typology, implemented using
SVMlight and C4.5 learning algorithms brought
satisfactory results of classification, not only on
the training corpus but also on an evaluation cor-
pus, since we obtained a precision on average of
80% and a recall of 70%. This classifier has then
been included into a tool to assist specialized com-
parable corpora compilation. Starting from a Web
documents collection selected by the user, this
tool realizes cleaning, normalization and linguis-
tic treatment of each document and ?physically?
creates the corpus.
This tool is a first attempt and can be improved.
In a first time, we would like to assist the selection
and collection of documents, which could be real-
ized through the tool. Moreover, we would like to
investigate needs of comparable corpora users in
order to adapt our tool. Finally, others languages
could be added to the system, which represents a
quite time-consuming task: a classifier would have
to be created so all the linguistic analysis and clas-
sification tasks would have to be done again for
other languages.
