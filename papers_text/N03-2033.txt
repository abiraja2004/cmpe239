Abstract 
We report here empirical results of a series of 
studies aimed at automatically predicting in-
formation quality in news documents. Multiple 
research methods and data analysis techniques 
enabled a good level of machine prediction of 
information quality. Procedures regarding user 
experiments and statistical analysis are de-
scribed.

Introduction 
As a part of a large-scale multi-institutional project 
HITIQA (High-quality Interactive Question Answer-
ing), we worked on developing an extended model for 
classifying information by quality, in addition to, and as 
an extension of the traditional notion of relevance. The 
project involves Computer and Information Science 
researchers from University at Albany and Rutgers Uni-
versity. Our serving clientele are intelligent analysts, 
and the documents that we targeted were news articles.    
Research Approach 
The term ?Quality? is defined by International Organi-
zation of Standards (1986) as ?the totality of 
characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to 
satisfy stated and implied need? (Standard 8402, 3.1). 
Among numerous study on classification of information 
quality, Wang and Strong (1996) proposed four dimen-
sions of qualities as detailed in Table 1: intrinsic, 
contextual, representational, and accessibility.

ability, Reputation

tional IQ 
Interpretability, Ease of Under-
standing, Concise Representa-

Empirical attempts to assess quality have primarily 
focused on counting hyperlinks in a networked envi-
ronment. Representative studies include the work by 
Amento and his colleagues (Amento, Terveen, & Hills, 
2000), Price and Hersh (1999), and Zhu and Gauch 
(2000). However, as a whole, previous studies were 
only able to produce algorithmic measures for Web 
documents based on link counts and with a limited 
number of quality aspects such as popularity. Our ap-
proach is to record actual users? quality assessments of 
news articles and conduct advanced statistical models of 
association between users? quality scoring and occur-
rence and prevalence of certain textual features.  
3 Methodology and Results 
Multiple research methods were used. Firstly, we con-
ducted focus-group sessions to elicit key quality aspects 
from news analysts. Secondly, we performed experts 
and students quality judgment experimental sessions. 
Thirdly, we identified a set of textual features, ran pro-
grams to generate counts of the features, and performed 
statistical analysis to establish the correlation between 
features and users? quality ratings. 
Two focus group sessions were conducted during 
March and April of 2002. Participants included journal-
ism faculty members, professional editors, and a num-
ber of journalists from a local newspaper Albany Times 
Union. Nine information quality criteria were consid-
ered to be salient to the context of news analysis: Accu-
racy, Source reliability, Objectivity, Depth, Author 
credibility, Readability, Conciseness, Grammatically 
Correctness, and Multiple Viewpoints. 
A computerized quality judgment system that incor-
porated the nine quality aspects was developed. One 
thousand medium-sized (100 to 2500 words) news arti-
cles were selected from the TREC collection (Voorhees, 
2001) with 25 relevant documents each from five TREC 
Q&A topics.  
We recruited expert and student participants for 
judgment experiments. Expert sessions were performed 
first and ten documents judged by experts were selected 
and used as the training and testing material for the stu-
dent participants. The entire judgment experiment pe-
riod ran from May to August of 2002. As a result, each 
of the 1,000 documents was rated twice, by two differ-
ent judges, one at Albany, and one at Rutgers. 
There were high inter-judge agreements between Al-
bany and Rutgers. Figure 1 is the normality plot of the 
difference between scores assigned by Rutgers? judges 
and Albany?s judges on the variable of ?accuracy,? with 
a mean almost equals to zero (with range from ? 9 to + 
9). The curves of the other eight quality variables are 
similar to the one below, indicating a very insignificant 
disagreement in judgments.

Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed the 
same two components from Albany data as from Rut-
gers data. As shown in Figure 2, one component (the 
lower one) consists of ?credibility?, ?source reliability?, 
?accuracy?, ?multi-view?, ?depth?, and ?objectivity.? 
The second component (the upper one) consists of 
?grammar?, ?readability?, and ?verbose and concise-
ness?. Together they explain 58% of the variance.

We recoded users? scores 1 to 5 as low and scores 6 
to 10 as high. We split the 1,000 documents into two 
halves by random selection. In our training round the 
first half was used to estimate the parameters that would 
give best discriminant and logistic regression functions. 
In our testing round, we applied the functions to the 
other half to predict the quality criteria of the docu-
ments.

We then employed stepwise discriminant analysis to 
select the dominant predictive variables from a range of 
104 textual features. These features included elements 
of punctuations, special symbols, length of document 
segments, upper case, quotations, key terms, POS, and 
entities. Our further analysis suggested that certain text 
features are highly correlated with each of the nine as-
pects.

At this point, we are able to produce good prediction 
of several aspects of information quality, including 
Depth, Objectivity, Multi-view, and Readability. The 
prediction testing and training for the remaining quality 
aspects are currently in progress. Tables 4 and 5 illus-
trate the results of training versus testing classification 
for the criteria of  ?objectivity? and ?depth,? with rat-
ings grouped into high and low categories.

4 Summary 
In this study, we were able to identify important quality 
criteria relevant to intelligent analysts? work and we 
were also able to generate automatic quality metrics of 
news documents using users? quality judgments. Our 
next step is to apply our machine prediction method to 
produce measures of a new set of documents and have 
users to verify and modify machines? scoring. We hope 
that through this, we can collect new data to test our 
quality metrics and to further improve its? performance.
