This session focused on experimental orplanned approaches 
to human language technology evaluation and included an 
overview and five papers: two papers on experimental eval- 
uation approaches\[l, 2\], and three about the ongoing work 
in new annotation and evaluation approaches for human lan- 
guage technology\[3, 4, 5\]. This was followed by fifteen min- 
utes of general discussion. 
When considering evaluation, it is important to consider the 
basic issues involved in evaluation: 
? .Why evaluate: what are the goals of evaluation? 
? What to evaluate: what function(s) of the system should 
be evaluated, e.g., what input/outputpairs a e compared? 
? How to evaluate: what procedures can be used to eva- 
lute specific system functions (or to grade goodness of 
input/output pairs)? 
? Where to go from here: what additional evaluations 
are needed and what can be developed to support future 
research? 
1. WHY EVALUATE? 
Evaluation serves a number of purposes: 
* Cross-system evaluation: This is a mainstay of the peri- 
odic ARPA evaluations on competing systems. Multiple 
sites agree to run their respective systems on a single ap- 
plication, so that results across systems are comparable. 
This includes evaluations such as message understanding 
(MUC)\[6\], information retrieval (TREC)\[7\], spoken lan- 
guage systems (ATIS)\[8\], and automated speech recog- 
nition (CSR)\[8\]. 
, Within-system progress: This is perhaps the most im- 
portant role because it supports incremental system de- 
velopment, debugging and even hill climbing and auto- 
mated learning approaches, if fast evaluation methods 
are available. 
? Understanding design trade-offs: It is well-known that 
there are trade-offs in system design, e.g., between speed 
and error rate for speech recognition systems; similarly, 
there may be trade-offs in error recovery and types of 
feedback in dialogue-based systems. Appropriate val- 
uation methods make it possible to design controlled 
experiments oinvestigate hese trade-offs. 
Directing research focus: Evaluation (especially when 
associated with research funding) brings increased atten- 
tion to the technology being evaluated. It also fosters in- 
creased infrastructure to support evaluation, and in turn, 
infrastructure supports evaluation. 1 The success of the 
ARPA human language technology program can be at- 
tributed in part to the judicious use of common evaluation 
to focus attention on particular research issues, resulting 
in rapid improvement in the technology, increased shar- 
ing of technical information, and broader participation 
in the research activities. 
2. WHAT TO EVALUATE? 
Once we decide to evaluate, the first question is what to eval- 
uate? Where do we put probes to inspect he input and output, 
in order to perform an evaluation? This issue is discussed in 
the Sparck Jones paper\[ 1 \]. In some cases, we can evaluate 
the language technology in isolation from any front-end or 
back-end application, as shown in Figure 1, where probes are 
inserted on either side of the language interface itself. This 
gives us the kind of evaluation used for word error rate in 
speech (speech in, transcription out) or for machine transla- 
tion, as proposed in the Brew/Thompson paper (source text in, 
target ext out)\[2\]. This kind of evaluation computes output 
as a simple function of input to the language system. 
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to measure a mean- 
ingful output- for example, researchers have struggled long 
and hard with measurements for unders tand ing  - how can 
a system demonstrate hat it has understood? If we had a 
general semantic representation, then we could insert a probe 
on the output side of the semantic omponent, independent 
of any specific application. The last three papers (\[3, 4, 5\]) 
take various approaches to the issue of predicate-argument 
1The Penn Treebank parse annotations provide an interesting case where 
annotation supported evaluation. By creating a theory-neutral description 
of a correct parse,  the Treebank annotation enabled researchers to take the 
next step in agreeing to use  the parse annotations (bracketings) as a "gold 
standard" against which to compare system-derived bracketings\[9\]. This 
evaluation, in turn, has enabled interesting automated teaming approaches to
parsing.

structure in an attempt to define a more semantically-based 
and application-independent measure. 
Right now, we can only measure understanding by evaluating 
an interface coupled to an application - Figure 2 shows the 
application back-end included inside the evaluation. This al- 
lows us to evaluate understanding in terms of getting the right 
answer for a specific task, as is done in the Air Travel In forma- 
tion (ATIS) system, which evaluates language input/database 
answer output pairs. However, this means that to evaluate 
spoken language understanding, it is necessary to build an 
entire air travel information system.

Finally, for certain kinds of applications, particularly inter- 
active applications, it is appropriate to enlarge the scope of 
evaluation still further to include the users. For interactive 
systems, this is particularly important because the user re- 
sponse determines what the system does next, so that it is 
not possible to use pre-recorded data. 2 Increasingly complex 
human-computer interfaces, as well as complex collaborative 
tools, demand that a system be evaluated in its overall context 
of use (see Figure 3).

3. HOW TO EVALUATE 
We must not only decide what inputs and outputs to use for 
evaluation; we must decide how to evaluate these input/output

sites, effectively removing human variability as a factor in the evaluation. 
pairs as well. Evaluation seems relatively easy when there is 
an intuitive pairing between input and output, for example, 
between speech signal and transcription atthe word or sen- 
tence level. The task is much more complex when there is 
either no representation for the output (how to represent un- 
derstanding?) or in situations where the result is not unique: 
what is the correct ranslation of a particular text? What is 
the best response to a particular query? For such cases, it is 
often expedient to rely on human judgements, provided that 
these judgements (or relative judgements) are reproducible, 
given a sufficient number of judges. Evaluation of machine 
translation systems\[lO\] has used human judges to evaluate 
systems with differing degrees of interactivity and across dif- 
ferent language pairs. The Brew and Thompson paper\[2\] also 
describes reliability of human judges in evaluating machine 
translation systems. Human judges have also been used in 
end-to-end evaluation of spoken language interfaces\[11\]. 
4. WHERE TO GO FROM HERE? 
Because valuation plays such an important role in driving 
research, we must weigh carefully what and how we evalu- 
ate. Evaluation should be theory neutral, to avoid bias against 
novel approaches; it should also push the frontiers of what 
we know how to do; and finally, it should support a broad 
range of research interests because valuation isexpensive. It
requires ignificant community investment in infrastructure, 
not to mention time devoted to running evaluations and par- 
ticipating in them. For example, we estimate that the ATIS 
evaluation required several person-years to prepare annotated 
data, a staffof two to three people at NIST over several months 
to run the evaluation, time spent agreeing on standards, and 
months of staff effort at participating sites. Altogether, the an- 
nual cost of an evaluation certainly exceeds five person-years, 
or conservatively at least $500,000 per evaluation. Given this 
level of investment, i  is critical to co-ordinate effort and ob- 
tain maximum leverage. 
The last three papers\[3, 4 5\] all reflect a concern to develop 
better evaluation methods for semantics, with a shared fo- 
cus on predicate-argument valuation. The Treebank anno- 
tation paper\[3\] discusses the new predicate-argument annota- 
tion work under Treebank. The paper by Grishman discusses 
a range of new evaluation efforts for MUC, which are aimed 
at providing finer grained component evaluations. The last 
paper, by Moore, describes a similar, but distinct, effort to- 
wards developing more semantic evaluation methods for the 
spoken language community. 
5. D ISCUSSION 
The discussion began with the question: can we afford three 
somewhat similar but distinct predicate-argument valua- 
tions? The resulting interchange helped to clarify the rela- 
tionship between these three proposals. Both Marcus and Gr- 
ishman argued that the Treebank annotation should directly 
support he MUC-style predicate-argument valuation out- 
lined in \[4\], although the Treebank annotations may be a sub- 
100 
set of what is used for MUC predicate-argument valuation. 
The relation of the spoken language "predicate-argument" 
evaluation to the other two was less clear. Moore explicitly 
stated uring the discussion (and Marcus agreed) that the Tree- 
bank annotation is quite different (more syntactic and more 
"surface") than the predicate-argument no ation planned for 
spoken language. Moore believed that a deeper level (less 
syntactic and more semantic) was needed to meet the needs 
of (some parts of) the spoken language community. Thus, 
although the spoken and written language communities have 
an opportunity to converge on some common annotation and 
evaluation metrics, this may well not happen. These an- 
notation and evaluation approaches are, however, "work-in- 
progress" and economic and time considerations may cause 
some convergence, ven while theories and research agendas 
remain distinct.
