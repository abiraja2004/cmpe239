Abstract
This contribution focuses on multimodal in-
teraction techniques for a mobile communi-
cation and assistance system on a robot plat-
form. The system comprises of acoustic, vi-
sual and haptic input modalities. Feedback is
given to the user by a graphical user interface
and a speech synthesis system. By this, mul-
timodal and natural communication with the
robot system is possible.
1 Introduction
The amount of older people in modern societies
constantly grows due to demographic changes (Eu-
ropean Commision Staff, 2007; Statistical Federal
Office of Germany, 2008). These people desire
to stay in their own homes as long as possible,
however suffer from first health problems, such as
decreased physical strength, cognitive decline (Pe-
tersen, 2004), visual and hearing impairments (Rud-
berg et al, 1993; Uimonen et al, 1999; Goetze et
al., 2010b). This poses great challenges to the care
systems since care services require a high amount of
temporal and personnel efforts. Furthermore, older
people living alone may suffer from social isolation
since family members, friends and acquaintances
may live at distant places and frequent face-to-face
communication may be hard to realize.
It is nowadays commonly accepted that support
by means of technical systems in the care sector
will be inevitable in the future to cope with these
challenges (Alliance, 2009). Examples for such as-
sistive devices are reminder systems (Boll et al,
2010), medical assistance and tele-healthcare sys-
tems (Lisetti et al, 2003), personal emergency re-
sponse systems, accessible human-machine interac-
tion (Rennies et al, 2011) or social robotics (Chew
et al, 2010).
This contribution describes the human-machine
interaction modalities for a social robot called
ALIAS (adaptable ambient living assistant) that is
depicted in Figure 1. ALIAS is a mobile robot plat-
form to foster communication and social interaction
between the user and his/her social network as well
as between the user and the robot platform. The aim
of ALIAS is to ensure the maintenance of existing
contacts to prevent social isolation instead of making
human-to-human communication obsolete. ALIAS
is supposed to act as a companion that encourages
its owner to cultivate relationships and contacts to
the real world.
Figure 1: ALIAS robot platform.
Instead of classical interaction techniques solely
1
by using mouse and keybord, multi-modal human-
machine interaction techniques allow for more natu-
ral and convenient human-machine interaction (Ovi-
att, 1999; Jaimes and Sebe, 2007; Goetze et al,
2010a). Especially for technology in the domain of
ambient assisted living (AAL) which is mostly in-
tended to be used by older users - these users often
are less technophile than younger users (Meis et al,
2007) - multi-modal interaction strategies including
modalities like speech and touch pads show high ac-
ceptance (Boll et al, 2010).
A touch display and a robust speech recognition
and synthesis system enable the ALIAS robot plat-
form to interact with the user via speech or using
the mounted touch display (cf. Figure 1). Besides
communication with the robot by speech input and
output, communication with relatives and acquain-
tances via telephone channels, mobile phone chan-
nels and the internet is a central goal. An automatic
reminder system motivating the user to participate
actively in social interaction is developed. In ad-
dition, the user is encouraged to perform cognitive
activities in order to preserve quality of life.
The following Section 2 briefly describes the sys-
tem components of the ALIAS robot platform be-
fore Section 3 focuses on the multi-modal user-
interaction strategies.
2 System Components and Applied
Technologies
The ALIAS robot system has a variety of human-
machine communication features and sensors. Fig-
ure 2 shows the general overview of the robots soft-
ware modules which will be briefly introduced in the
following.
The dialogue manager (DM) is the robot?s most
central component since it is the software module
which is responsible for all decisions the robot has to
take. Therefore, it is connected to almost every other
module. The DM collects inputs and events from all
these modules, interprets them, and decides which
actions to perform, i.e. commands to send to which
modules. It may move the robot to check on its user,
initiate a video telephone call, or ask for a game of
chess. The dialogue manager runs on the Windows
computer, which is one of the two computer systems
in the ALIAS system.
Figure 2: Overview of the ALIAS robot?s software mod-
ules, distributed on two computers.
The graphical user interface (GUI) has a close
link to the dialogue manager since it integrates sev-
eral applications and receives user inputs of the Win-
dows computer?s operating system. Thus, it reacts
to touch input and displays menus and all software
modules with graphical output. (Section 3.1 pro-
vides more detailed information on the GUI.)
The automatic speech recognition (ASR) mod-
ule enables the robot to understand and react on spo-
ken commands (Moritz et al, 2011). It receives
recorded audio signals from the Jack audio-server
and converts it to a textual representation of spoken
words. This list of recognized words will be sent
to the DM for interpretation (cf. Section 3.2 for de-
tails).
The speech synthesis module enables the robot to
communicate with its owner verbally (together with
the ASR sytem). Speech synthesis (Taylor, 2009)
is the artificial production of human voice. Text-
to-speech (TTS) systems are used to convert writ-
ten text into speech. An advanced system should be
able to take any arbitrary text input and convert it
into speech, whereby the language of the text must
be known to be able to create the correct pronunci-
ation. Several systems for speech synthesis are al-
ready commercially available to realize such a sys-
tem. Speech output was found to be a desired user
interaction strategy for assistive systems (Goetze et
al., 2010a) if output phrases are properly designed
2
since there?s no need to reach out for the robot?s dis-
play unit in order to interact with it.
A link to the world-wide web is established by
integration of an easy-to-use web browser which
is seamlessly integrated into the GUI. To counter-
act isolation an event search web service was real-
ized (Khrouf and Troncy., 2011) that visualizes var-
ious events and corresponding pictures to the user
that have taken place or will take place close to the
user?s location. To achieve this the robot connects
to an online event search service. The service will
provide him/her with a personalized selection of so-
cial event near his/her current location and personal
preferences.
An input modality suitable for users that are
unable to touch the robot?s screen or to verbal-
ize a speech command (e.g. after a stroke) is the
brain computer interface (BCI) of the robot (Hin-
termu?ller et al, 2011). It uses a set of electrodes
placed on the user?s skull to measure electrical re-
sponses of the brain. These electrical potentials are
evoked by means of visual stimuli, e.g. flashing im-
ages on a control display. By focusing on certain
items on the BCI control display the user?s brain ac-
tivity can control the GUI of the robot. The BCI may
also be used for writing text messages which can be
sent using the integrated Skype? chat functionality
of the robot.
To distinguish between its owner and other per-
sons, the robot uses an acoustic speaker recogni-
tion module. This provides ALIAS with additional
information which can be used to differentiate be-
tween persons and interprete multiple speech inputs
according to their individual context.
In order to achieve more human-like character-
istics, the robot uses a face identification module.
So it is able to adjust its eyes to face the person it?s
talking to. The face detection algorithm utilizes the
robot?s 360? panorama camera located on top of the
robot?s head, and thus covers the robots surround-
ings, completely.
The navigation module handles the actual move-
ment, collision prevention, and odometry of the
robot. It drives ALIAS by plotting waypoints on
a pre-recorded map. Obstacles are detected using
ultra-sonic sensors, the laser scanner, and the front
camera. In case the robot?s path is blocked, the nav-
igation module will plot an alternative route in order
to reach the designated target location, evading the
obstacle (Kessler et al, 2011). The navigation mod-
ule may also be remotely controlled by another per-
son in order to check on the robot?s owner in case
an accident has been detected or the owner has re-
quested for help.
3 Multimodal Interaction Strategies
The robot?s user interface features different input
modalities; speech commands, the BCI, or the touch
screen (GUI). For speech input, the ASR mod-
ule processes the recorded speech commands and
translates them into multiple textual representations,
which are then sent to the DM for interpretation.
BCI and GUI include a display unit to provide
feedback to the user. Thus they require an addi-
tional pathway for receiving commands from the
DM. In case of the BCI, available items on its con-
trol screen may be switched by the DM to reflect the
current dialogue state, i.e. a selection of audio books
if the audio book module has been accessed. For the
GUI, which integrates several software applications
into one single module, there is also the possibility
of non-user related events, such as incoming phone
calls from the integrated Skype module. The GUI
has to relay these events to the DM for decision.
All user inputs and relevant system events are
gathered by the DM. As the ALIAS system?s cen-
tral control unit, the DM keeps track of all active
robot modules and relevant sensor data. It merges
all provided inputs, puts them into context, inter-
prets them, and decides which actions to perform.
Whereas some inputs may be redundant, others may
be invalid or highly dependent on the context.
For example, pushing a button on the touch screen
is most likely related to the application that is run-
ning on the screen. Whereas the spoken phrase ?on
the right? could mean that the user wants ALIAS to
push a button that is located on the right hand side of
its screen. Another interpretation would be that the
user wants the robot to turn to the right and move
aside. Or the user was talking to another person in
the room, possibly even on ALIAS? video telephone,
and the spoken statement is not to concern the robot
at all.
This section provides a closer look on the ALIAS
robot?s most frequently used user interfaces and
3
their design.
3.1 Graphical User Interface
The GUI consists of a series of menus containing a
few large buttons, each of them leading to another
menu or starting an application, i.e. an integrated
software module. The GUI?s main menu is shown
in Figure 3.
The GUI uses a minimalistic design, including
some light gradients and blur for non-essential back-
ground components. Whereas the actual buttons fea-
ture comprehensive icons and text labels with large
fonts, enclosed by high-contrast black frames. This
eases distinction between buttons and background.
Taking visual impairments into account the GUI
remains usable, while still being visually pleasing
for people with unimpaired vision. Due to each
users individual color perception, colors are used
sparsely and mustn?t be the sole cue to carry es-
sential information. Instead combinations of colors,
shapes, and labels are preferred.
Figure 3: ALIAS robot?s main menu.
The GUI depends on animations; buttons flash in
a different (dark) colors when pressed and menus
sliding on and off the screen when switched. Such
animations provide visual feedback to user inputs
and are unlikely to be missed by the user, since they
involve the whole screen, usually.
The GUI makes a clear distinction between menus
and application modules, though both are supposed
to look quite similar on the screen. Menus provide
access to sub-menus and integrated software mod-
ules i.e. applications, using a tree-like menu struc-
ture which is defined by a configuration file.
Application modules implement their very own
individual layouts, buttons, features, and remote-
control capabilities for the DM. By this, some fea-
tures are available after the related application has
been started, only. The GUI features a selection
of integrated application modules, like a Skype?-
based video telephone, a web-browser, a television
module, an audio book player, a selection of serious
games, and access to the robot?s Wii gaming con-
sole.
The GUI processes two kinds of user inputs; di-
rect inputs and indirect inputs. Both input types will
be further outlined below.
3.1.1 Direct Inputs
The GUI accepts normal user inputs, as they are
provided by the host computer?s operating system.
In case of the ALIAS robot the main source of such
inputs will be the touch screen. These inputs are
considered as direct inputs, since they are provided
by the computer?s operating system and are handled
by the GUI directly.
More generally every input falls into the group
of direct inputs if the GUI is directly receiving it.
Accordingly even an incoming phone call is a di-
rect input, because it is triggered by an integrated
GUI module. So, unless properly handled and prop-
agated, no other module would ever know about it.
Thus, most direct inputs also need to be relayed to
the dialogue manager that takes over the role of a
state machine to keep all modules on the robot syn-
chronized. If, for example, any input in the current
situation is not allowed or even undesirable the DM
can intervene and reject those inputs.
3.1.2 Indirect Inputs
A second kind of user inputs is represented by the
group of indirect inputs. Indirect inputs are system
messages, received by the GUI. Basically indirect
inputs are inputs that are handled by another mod-
ule, but require a reaction by the GUI. Typically such
indirect inputs are generated by the Dialogue Man-
ager, as response to a speech input for example.
The user may issue a verbal command to the
robot: ?Call Britta, please!? The sound wave is
picked up by the robot?s microphones, converted
4
into a sampled audio signal that is redirected by the
Jack Audio Server to the speech recognition mod-
ule. The speech recognition module converts the
audio signal to a textual representation that will be
interpreted and processed by the dialogue manager.
In case the dialogue manager finds a contact named
?Britta? in its data base, it sends a series of network
messages to the GUI, containing the required com-
mands to bring up the telephone application and ini-
tiate the phone call.
3.1.3 Multi-modal Input
Most parts of the GUI can be controlled by touch
display as well as by spoken commands. Further-
more, a control by the BCI is possible for parts of the
GUI (currently Skype chat and entertainment such
as audio books).
Figure 4: Multi-modal input dialog for appointments.
An example for a multi-modal interaction is the
appointment input window depicted in Figure 4. It
contains information about the category, the title, the
start and end time of the appointment and a possibil-
ity to set a reminder. The interface can be controlled
by mouse and keyboard as well as via speech com-
mands following a structured dialogue. By this, the
used is free to chose if he/she wants to use mouse
and keyboard as a fast way to enter an appointment
or speech if he/she is not close enough to the robot?s
touch display and is either not willing or not capable
to reach it.
3.2 Speech Recognition
Creating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) de-
vice requires different processing steps. Figure 5 il-
lustrates exemplary the structure of such a system.
Figure 5: Schematic technical design of the ASR system.
A very important step is to collect a sufficiently
large amount of speech data from many different
speakers. This speech data is used to train the acous-
tic models, which in this case are hidden Markov
models (HMM), and described in terms of well-
known Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
(Benesty et al, 2008). Besides the HMM models
of known words also so-called garbage models are
trained, since the ASR device needs to be capable to
distinguish not only between words that were trained
from the training utterances but also between known
and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
In addition to the acoustic models a proper speech
recognition system also needs a language model.
The language model provides grammatical infor-
mation about the utterances that are presented by
the subjects to the ASR system. Language models
can be separated into groups of statistical and non-
statistical models. The ALIAS ASR system com-
prises of two recognition systems that are running at
5
different grammatical rules (cf. Figure 6). The first
ASR system uses a non-statistical language model
that is typically used for ASR systems with small
vocabulary size and very strict input expectations.
This ASR system can be considered as a keyword
spotter. In contrast, N-gram models can also be used
for continuous speech recognition systems, where
the grammatical information can get a lot more com-
plex. Thus, the second recognizer uses statistical
grammar rules (N-gram) which consists of a 2-gram
forward and 3-gram backward model and enables
the system to make a more soft decision on the rec-
ognized sentence.
By this two-way approach, the keyword spotting
system can do a reliable search for important catch-
words, whereby the second recognizer tries to under-
stand more context from the spoken sentence. This
ensures an even broader heuristic processing for the
DM.

With the acoustic models and a valid language
model the speech recognition device is now able to
operate. The user utters any command, which is
picked up by a microphone. Since in real-world sce-
narios the microphones do not only pick up the de-
sired speech content but also disturbances like ambi-
ent noise or sounds produced by the (moving) robot
system itself, the microphone signal has to be en-
hanced by appropriate signal processing schemes
(Ha?nsler and Schmidt, 2004; Goetze et al, 2010a;
Cauchi et al, 2012) before ASR features (MFCCs)
are extracted from the speech input.A The extracted
features are then transferred to the decoding system
where the content of speech is analyzed.
ASR processing deals in terms of probabilities.
Although speech recognition has been identified as
a highly desired input modality for assistive systems
(Goetze et al, 2010a) the acceptance drastically de-
creases if the recognition rate is not sufficiently high.
For every acoustic input there are multiple recog-
nition alternatives, with varying probabilities. In-
stead of using only the most probable recognition
for output, the ASR module provides the DM with
a few additional alternatives. This allows the DM a
more thorough analysis and thus a more precise in-
terpretation of the provided speech input to decide
for an output on the GUI or an action (e.g. moving
the roboter).
4 Conclusion
This paper presented multimodal interaction strate-
gies for an robot assistant which has its main fo-
cus on support of communication. This includes
both, fostering of human-to-human communication
by providing communication capabilities over dif-
ferent channels and reminding on neglected relation-
ships as well as communication between the techni-
cal system and its user by means of speech recogni-
tion and speech output.
