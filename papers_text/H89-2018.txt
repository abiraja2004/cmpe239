ABSTRACT 
As part of our effort in developing a spoken language system for interactive problem solving, we recently 
collected a sizeable amount of speech data. This database is composed of spontaneous sentences which were 
collected uring a simulated human/machine dialogue. Since a computer log of the spoken dialogue was 
maintained, we were able to ask the subjects to provide read versions of the sentences as well. This paper 
documents he data collection process, and provides ome preliminary analyses of the collected ata. 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the first tasks confronting researchers developing a spoken language system is the collection of 
data for analysis, system training, and evaluation. Since people do not always say grammatically well- 
formed sentences during a spoken dialogue with a computer, the currently available read speech databases 
may not capture the acoustic and linguistic variabilities found in goal-directed spontaneous speech. As a 
first attempt o create a spontaneous speech database 1, we have recently collected a large amount of data 
from 100 subjects during simulated ialogues with the VOYAGER spoken language system. The purpose of 
this paper is to document the database construction process, and to provide some preliminary linguistic and 
acoustic analysis. 
VOYAGER is a system that knows about he physical environment ofa specific geographical rea as well as 
certain objects inside this area, and can provide assistance on how to get from one location to another within 
this area. It currently focuses on the geographic area of the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, between MIT 
and Harvard University, and can deal with several distinct concepts including directions, distance and time 
of travel between objects, relationships such as "nearest," and simple properties such as phone numbers or 
types of food served. VOYAQErt also has a limited amount of discourse knowledge which enables it to respond 
to queries uch as: "How do I get there?" It can also deal with certain clarification fragments such as: "The 
bank in Harvard Square." A detailed escription of the VOYAGER system can be found elsewhere in these 
proceedings \[1\]. 
VOYAGER is made up of three components. The first component, the SUMMIT speech recognition system 
\[2\], converts the speech signal into a set of word hypotheses. The natural anguage component, TINA \[3\], 
provides a linguistic interpretation f the set of words. The parse tree generated by TINA is translated into a 
query language form, which is used to produce a response. Currently VOYAGER can generate responses in the 
form of text, graphics, and synthetic speech. The back end is an enhanced version of a direction assistance 
program developed by Jim Davis of MIT's Media Laboratory \[4\].

lWe loosely use the terra spontaneous speech to mean the speech produced by a person "on the fly" when interacting with 
a computer for problem solving.

DATABASE CONSTRUCTION 
We believe that data should be collected under conditions that closely reflect the actual capabilities of 
the system. As a result, we have chosen to have subjects use the system as if they are trying to obtain actual 
information. The data were recorded in a simulation mode in which the speech recognition component was 
excluded. This step was taken partly to avoid long processing delays that would disrupt the human-machine 
interaction. Instead, an experimenter in a separate room typed in the utterances spoken by the subject, 
after removing false starts and hesitations. Subsequent processing by the natural language and response 
generation components was done automatically by the computer.

was hidden from the subject's view to avoid unnecessary distractions. 
DATA COLLECT ION 
The data were collected in an office environment where the ambient noise was approximately 65 dB SPL, 
measured on the C scale. A Sennheiser HMD-224 noise-cancelling microphone was used to record the speech. 
The subject sat in front of a computer console that displayed the geographical rea of interest as shown in 
Figure 1. The console was slaved to the experimenter's console in the adjacent room. The experimenter's 
typing, shown in the bottom of the display, was hidden from the subject to avoid unnecessary distractions. 
Two information sheets describing both the knowledge base of VOYAGER and its possible responses were 
available to the subject. The subjects referred to these sheets from time to time in order to stay within 
VOYAGER's domain of knowledge. 
During a subject's dialogue, both the input speech and the resulting responses were recorded on audio 
tape. The voice input, minus false starts, hesitations, and filled pauses, was typed verbatim to VOYAGER by an 
127 
experimenter, and saved automatically in a computer log. The system response was generated automatically 
from this text, which was also recorded into the log. The system's response typically took a second or two 
after the text had been entered. 
Whenever a sentence contained words or constructs that were unknown to the natural language compo- 
nent, the system would explain to the subject why a response could not be generated. In the event that 
the queries were outside of the knowledge domain and the system responses could not dislodge the subject 
from that line of questioning, the experimenter could override the system and trigger a canned response 
explaining that the system was currently unable to handle that kind of request. Another canned response 
was available for the case when the subject produced several queries at once. 
Each session lasted approximately 30 minutes, and began with a five minute introductory audio tape 
describing the task. This was followed by a 20 minute dialogue between the subject and VOYAGER. Following 
the dialogue, the subject was asked to read his or her sentences from the computer log. The resulting 
database therefore included both a read and a spontaneous version of the same sentence, modulo false starts, 
hesitations, and filled pauses in the spontaneous version. 
Fifty male and fifty female subjects were recruited as subjects from the general vicinity of MIT. They 
ranged in age from 18 to 59. The only requirement was that they be native speakers of American English with 
no known speech defects. For their efforts, each subject was given a gift certificate at a popular ice-cream 
parlor. The entire recording was carried out over a nine-day period in late July. Several of the sessions were 
also recorded on video tape to document the data collection process. 
D IG IT IZAT ION AND TRANSCRIPT ION 
The recordings made during the data collection were digitized at 16 kHz, after being band-limited at 
8 kHz. Special care was used to ensure that false starts, hesitations, mouth clicks, and breath noise were 
included as part of the digitized utterance. In addition, prg-determined conventions were established, and 
written instructions provided, for transcribing these non-speech and partial-word events both orthographi- 
cally and phonetically. We started with the notations uggested by Rudnicky \[5\], and made modifications 
to suit our needs. 
To date, the entire database of 9,692 utterances has been digitized and orthographically transcribed, 
including markers for false starts, partial words, and non-word sounds. In addition, an aligned phonetic 
transcription has been obtained for approximately 20% of the data. 
PREL IMINARY ANALYSIS 
We have divided the database into three parts according to speakers. Data from 70 arbitrarily selected 
speakers were designated as the training set. Of the remaining speakers, two-thirds were designated as the 
development set, and the rest as the ~est set. In each set, there were equal numbers of male and female 
speakers. In this section, we will report on the results of some preliminary analysis on parts of this database, 
carried out over the past few weeks. 
GENERAL STATISTICS 
From the computer log, we were able to automatically generate some preliminary statistics of the 
database. Table 1 summarizes some of the relevant statistics for the sum of the training and develop- 
ment sets. Note that the number of sentences refers to the spontaneous ones; the total number collected is 
double this amount. 
As the table reveals, approximately two-thirds of the sentences could be handled by the current version 
of VOYAGEa. The remaining third of the data is evenly divided between sentences with out-of-vocabulary 
words and sentences for which no parses were generated. These sentences can be used to extend VOYAGER'S

capabilities. Only a very small amount, about 1%, were parsed but not acted upon. This is a direct result 
of our conscious decision to constrain the coverage of the natural anguage component according to the 
capabilities of the back-end. 
The version of VOYAGER used for data collection had a vocabulary of about 300 words which were 
determined primarily from a small set of sentences that we made up. It is interesting to note that only 
about 200 of these words were actually used by the subjects. While the number of unknown words appears 
to be large, they actually account for less than 3% of the total number of words when frequency of usage is 
considered. 
The statistics of this database indicated that an average of slightly less than 50 sentences per subject 
were collected in each 20 minute dialogue. Thus we believe the database can easily be expanded as the 
capabilities of the system grow. 
ACOUSTIC  ANALYSIS 
Since time-aligned phonetic transcriptions were already available for part of the database, we performed 
some comparative acoustic analyses of the spontaneous and read utterances. These preliminary analyses 
were carried out using slightly over 1,750 sentences from 9 male and 9 female training speakers. While these 
data represent less than 20% of the recorded ata, there were more than 60,000 phonetic events. As a result, 
the quantitative differences were found to be statistically significant. Rather than exhaustively reporting our 
findings, we will make a few observations based on some interesting examples. 
Figure 2 compares the overall duration of the read and spontaneous tterances. In this and subsequent 
figures, the thin line denotes read speech, whereas the thick line denotes pontaneous speech. The horizontal 
bars show the means and standard eviations. These values, together with the sample size, are also displayed 
to the right. The figure suggests that spontaneous utterances are longer than their read counterparts by 
more than one-third. However, there is much more variability in the duration of spontaneous speech, as 
evidenced by its considerably arger standard eviation. 
There were nearly 1,000 pauses found in the spontaneous sentences in our dataset, or more than one per 
sentence on the average. 2 In contrast, there were only about 200 pauses found in the read sentences. As 
Figure 3 reveals, the pauses in spontaneous speech are about 2.5 times longer on the average than those in 
read speech. Their durations are also much more variable. 
There are nearly 400 non-speech vocalizations found in this database, including mouth clicks, breath

noise (both inhaling and exhaling), and filled pauses uch as "um, "uh," or "ah." Their distributions are 
shown in Table 2. Non-speech vocalizations occur about 2.7 times more often in spontaneous speech than in 
read speech. Almost all of the clicks appear at the beginning of sentences for read speech, whereas 25% of 
them occur sentence internally in spontaneous speech. Similarly, more than 20% of the breath no, ise occurs 
sentence internally, with five times as many in spontaneous speech as in read speech. All the filled pauses 
occur in spontaneous speech, two-thirds of them sentence internally. 
When we measured the durations of individual phonemes, we found very little difference between the 
two speech styles. Figure 4, for example, shows that the average vowel durations for read and spontaneous 
speech are 89 ms and 95 ms, respectively. Occasionally, we observed unusually long vowels in the spontaneous 
speech. They almost always correspond to words like "is" or "to," when the subject ries to decide what to 
say next. An example is shown in Figure 5. 
L INGUIST IC ANALYSIS 
When the database was transcribed orthographically, false starts and non-words uch as "ah," "um," or 
laughter were explicitly marked in the orthography. Therefore, it is possible to perform astatistical nalysis of

how often such events occurred. We distinguished between on-words internal to the sentence and non-words 
at the beginning or end of the sentence. In the training set containing about 3,300 spontaneous sentences, 
more than 10% of the sentences contained at least one of these effects. An additional 25% contained mouth 
clicks or breath noise, which may be a less serious effect. About half of the non-words appear sentence 
internally. 
False starts occurred in almost 4% of the spontaneous sentences. Table 3 categorizes the words following 
false starts in terms of whether a given word was the same as the intended word, a different word in the 
same category, a new linguistic category, or a back up to repeat words already uttered. An example is given 
for each case. Over 40% of the time, the talker repeated words after the false start. In order to recognize 
such sentences correctly, the system would have to detect false starts and back up to an appropriate arlier 
syntactic boundary.

We have examined the linguistic content of the training sentences and have begun to use them to expand 
VOYAGER's coverage. We have found a number of new linguistic patterns that are entirely appropriate for 
the domain, as well as a few recurring concepts currently outside of the domain that would be reasonable 
to add. An example of the latter is a comparison between two objects, such as "Which is closer to here, 
MIT or Harvard University?" In addition, we were surprised at the number of ways people said certain

things. For instance, for sentences like "What is the phone number of MIT?" the prepositions, "of," "at," 
"for," and "to" were all used. In a similar vein, the "from location" in a sentence requesting distance 
between two objects occurred in five distinct syntactic locations within the sentence. Users also sometimes 
spoke ungrammatically, violating both syntactic and semantic onstraints. In other cases they asked abstract 
questions or questions involving judgment calls that would be inappropriate for VOYAGER to handle. Some of 
these sentences were probably uttered ue to curiosity about how the system would respond. Some examples 
are given in Table 4. 
SUMMARY 
This paper documents our initial effort in developing a spontaneous speech database, and reports some 
preliminary analyses of the collected ata. We found the process of data collection to be relatively straight- 
forward, and we believe it will be fairly easy to collect more data at a later stage, after VOYAGER's capabilities 
have improved. In fact, we believe that incremental data collection done this way can be quite effective for 
development of spoken language systems. 
Our preliminary analysis of these data has already indicated some significant differences between spon- 
taneous and read speech. We are also beginning to use the database to train and evaluate the VOYAGER 
system, both at the acoustic-phonetic and the linguistic levels. The results of the preliminary evaluation are 
described in a companion paper \[6\].
