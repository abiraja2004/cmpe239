Abstract
Mistranslation of an ambiguous word can have
a large impact on the understandability of a
given sentence. In this article, we describe
a thorough evaluation of the translation qual-
ity of ambiguous nouns in three different se-
tups. We compared two statistical Machine
Translation systems and one dedicated Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system. Our
WSD system incorporates multilingual infor-
mation and is independent from external lex-
ical resources. Word senses are derived auto-
matically from word alignments on a parallel
corpus. We show that the two WSD classifiers
that were built for these experiments (English?
French and English?Dutch) outperform the
SMT system that was trained on the same cor-
pus. This opens perspectives for the integra-
tion of our multilingual WSD module in a sta-
tistical Machine Translation framework, in or-
der to improve the automated translation of
ambiguous words, and by consequence make
the translation output more understandable.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the NLP
task that consists in assigning a correct sense to
an ambiguous word in a given context. Tradition-
ally, WSD relies on a predefined monolingual sense-
inventory such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and
WSD modules are trained on corpora, which are
manually tagged with senses from these inventories.
A number of issues arise with these monolingual su-
pervised approaches to WSD. First of all, there is a
lack of large sense-inventories and sense-tagged cor-
pora for languages other than English. Furthermore,
sense inventories such as WordNet contain very fine-
grained sense distinctions that make the sense dis-
ambiguation task very challenging (even for human
annotators), whereas very detailed sense distinctions
are often irrelevant for practical applications. In ad-
dition to this, there is a growing feeling in the com-
munity that WSD should be used and evaluated in
real application such as Machine Translation (MT)
or Information Retrieval (IR) (Agirre and Edmonds,
2006).
An important line of research consists in the de-
velopment of dedicated WSD modules for MT. In-
stead of assigning a sense label from a monolin-
gual sense-inventory to the ambiguous words, the
WSD system has to predict a correct translation for
the ambiguous word in a given context. In (Vick-
rey et al, 2005), the problem was defined as a word
translation task. The translation choices of ambigu-
ous words are gathered from a parallel corpus by
means of word alignment. The authors reported
improvements on two simplified translation tasks:
word translation and blank filling. The evaluation
was done on an English-French parallel corpus but
is confronted with the important limitation of hav-
ing only one valid translation (the aligned transla-
tion in the parallel corpus) as a gold standard trans-
lation. Cabezas and Resnik (2005) tried to improve
an SMT system by adding additional translations to
the phrase table, but were confronted with tuning
problems of this dedicated WSD feature. Specia
(2006) used an inductive logic programming-based
WSD system which was tested on seven ambigu-
ous verbs in English-Portuguese translation. The lat-
ter systems already present promising results for the
use of WSD in MT, but really significant improve-
ments in terms of general machine translation qual-
52
ity were for the first time obtained by Carpuat and
Wu (2007) and Chan et al (2007). Both papers
describe the integration of a dedicated WSD mod-
ule in a Chinese-English statistical machine trans-
lation framework and report statistically significant
improvements in terms of standard MT evaluation
metrics.
Stroppa et al (2007) take a completely dif-
ferent approach to perform some sort of implicit
Word Sense Disambiguation in MT. They introduce
context-information features that exploit source sim-
ilarity, in addition to target similarity that is modeled
by the language model, in an SMT framework. For
the estimation of these features that are very simi-
lar to the typical WSD local context features (left
and right context words, Part-of-Speech of the focus
phrase and context words), they use a memory-based
classification framework.
The work we present in this paper is different
from previous research in two aspects. Firstly,
we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art
SMT systems and a dedicated WSD system on the
translation of ambiguous words. The comparison is
done against a manually constructed gold-standard
for two language pairs, viz. English?French and
English?Dutch. Although it is crucial to measure the
general translation quality after integrating a dedi-
cated WSD module in the SMT system, we think it is
equally interesting to conduct a dedicated evaluation
of the translation quality on ambiguous nouns. Stan-
dard SMT evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) or edit-distance metrics (e.g. Word
Error Rate) measure the global overlap of the trans-
lation with a reference, and are thus not very sen-
sitive to WSD errors. The mistranslation of an am-
biguous word might be a subtle change compared to
the reference sentence, but it often drastically affects
the global understanding of the sentence.
Secondly, we explore the potential benefits of a
real multilingual approach to WSD. The idea to use
translations from parallel corpora to distinguish be-
tween word senses is based on the hypothesis that
different meanings of a polysemous word are often
lexicalized across languages (Resnik and Yarowsky,
2000). Many WSD studies have incorporated this
cross-lingual evidence idea and have successfully
applied bilingual WSD classifiers (Gale and Church,
1993; Ng et al, 2003; Diab and Resnik, 2002) or
systems that use a combination of existing Word-
Nets with multilingual evidence (Tufis? et al, 2004).
Our WSD system is different in the sense that it is
independent from a predefined sense-inventory (it
only uses the parallel corpus at hand) and that it
is truly multilingual as it incorporates information
from four other languages (French, Dutch, Span-
ish, Italian and German depending on the target lan-
guage of the classifier). Although our classifiers are
still very preliminary in terms of the feature set and
parameters that are used, we obtain interesting re-
sults on our test sample of ambiguous nouns. We
therefore believe our system can have a real added
value for SMT, as it can easily be trained for differ-
ent language pairs on exactly the same corpus which
is used to train the SMT system, which should make
the integration a lot easier.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces the two machine transla-
tion systems we evaluated, while section 3 describes
the feature construction and learning algorithm of
our multilingual WSD system. Section 4 gives an
overview of the experimental setup and results. We
finally draw conclusions and present some future re-
search in Section 5.
2 Statistical Machine Translation Systems
For our experiments, we analyzed the behavior
of two phrase-based statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems on the translation of ambiguous
nouns. SMT generates translations on the basis
of statistical models whose parameters are derived
from the analysis of sentence-aligned parallel text
corpora. Phrase-based SMT is considered as the
dominant paradigm in MT research today. It com-
bines a phrase translation model (which is based on
the noisy channel model) and a phrase-based de-
coder in order to find the most probable translation e
of a foreign sentence f (Koehn et al, 2003). Usually
the Bayes rule is used to reformulate this translation
probability:
argmaxep(e|f) = argmaxep(f |e)p(e)
This allows for a language model p(e) that guar-
antees the fluency and grammatical correctness of
the translation, and a separate translation model
p(f |e) that focusses on the quality of the transla-
53
tion. Training of both the language model (on mono-
lingual data) as well as the translation model (on
bilingual text corpora) requires large amounts of text
data.
Research has pointed out that adding more train-
ing data, both for the translation as for the lan-
guage models, results in better translation quality,
(Callison-Burch et al, 2009). Therefore it is impor-
tant to notice that our comparison of the two SMT
systems is somewhat unfair, as we compared the
Moses research system (that was trained on the Eu-
roparl corpus) with the Google commercial system
that is trained on a much larger data set. It remains
an interesting exercise though, as we consider the
commercial system as the upper bound of how far
current SMT can get in case it has unlimited access
to text corpora and computational resources.
2.1 Moses
The first statistical machine translation system we
used is the off-the-shelf Moses toolkit (Koehn et al,
2007). As the Moses system is open-source, well
documented, supported by a very lively users fo-
rum and reaches state-of-the-art performance, it has
quickly been adopted by the community and highly
stimulated development in the SMT field. It also fea-
tures factored translation models, which enable the
integration of linguistic and other information at the
word level. This makes Moses a good candidate to
experiment with for example a dedicated WSD mod-
ule, that requires more enhanced linguistic informa-
tion (such as lemmas and Part-of-Speech tags).
We trained Moses for English?French and English?
Dutch on a large subsection of the Europarl corpus
(See Section 3 for more information on the corpus),
and performed some standard cleaning. Table 1 lists
the number of aligned sentences after cleaning the
bilingual corpus, and the number of uni-, bi- and tri-
grams that are comprised by the language model.
2.2 Google
In order to gain insights in the upper bounds for
current SMT, we also analyzed the output of the
Google Translate API1 for our set of ambiguous
nouns. Google Translate currently supports 57 lan-
guages. As both the amount of parallel and mono-

lingual training data as well as the computer power
are crucial for statistical MT, Google (that disposes
of large computing clusters and a network of data
centers for Web search) has very valuable assets at
its disposal for this task. We can only speculate
about the amount of resources that Google uses to
train its translation engine. Part of the training data
comes from transcripts of United Nations meetings
(in six official languages) and those of the Euro-
pean Parliament (Europarl corpus). Google research
papers report on a distributed infrastructure that is
used to train on up to two trillion tokens, which re-
sult in language models containing up to 300 billion
ngrams (Brants et al, 2007).
3 ParaSense
This section describes the ParaSense WSD system:
a multilingual classification-based approach to
Word Sense Disambiguation. Instead of using
a predefined monolingual sense-inventory such
as WordNet, we use a language-independent
framework where the word senses are derived
automatically from word alignments on a parallel
corpus. We used the sentence-aligned Europarl
corpus (Koehn, 2005) for the construction of our
WSD module. The following six languages were
selected: English (our focus language), Dutch,
French, German, Italian and Spanish. We only
considered the 1-1 sentence alignments between
English and the five other languages. This way we
obtained a six-lingual sentence-aligned subcorpus
of Europarl, that contains 884.603 sentences per
language. For our experiments we used the lexical
sample of twenty ambiguous nouns that was also
used in the SemEval-2010 ?Cross-Lingual Word
Sense Disambiguation? (CLWSD) task (Lefever
and Hoste, 2010b), which consists in assigning a
54
correct translation in five supported target languages
(viz. French, Italian, Spanish, German and Dutch)
for an ambiguous focus word in a given context.
In order to detect all relevant translations
for the twenty ambiguous focus words, we ran
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with its default set-
tings on our parallel corpus. The obtained word
alignment output was then considered to be the clas-
sification label for the training instances for a given
classifier (e.g. the French translation resulting from
the word alignment is the label that is used to train
the French classifier). This way we obtained all
class labels (or oracle translations) for all training
instances for our five classifiers (English as an input
language and French, German, Dutch, Italian and
Spanish as target languages). For the experiments
described in this paper, we focused on the English?
French and English?Dutch classifiers.
We created two experimental setups. The first
training set contains the automatically generated
word alignment translations as labels. A postpro-
cessing step was applied on these translations in or-
der to automatically filter leading and trailing deter-
miners and prepositions from the GIZA++ output.
For the creation of the second training set, we man-
ually verified all word alignment correspondences
of the ambiguous words. This second setup gives
an idea of the upperbound performance in case the
word alignment output could be further improved for
our ambiguous nouns.
3.1 Classifier
To train our WSD classifiers, we used the memory-
based learning (MBL) algorithms implemented in
TIMBL (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005),
which has successfully been deployed in previous
WSD classification tasks (Hoste et al, 2002). We
performed very basic heuristic experiments to de-
fine the parameter settings for the classifier, leading
to the selection of the Jeffrey Divergence distance
metric, Gain Ratio feature weighting and k = 7 as
number of nearest neighbours. In future work, we
plan to use an optimized word-expert approach in
which a genetic algorithm performs joint feature se-
lection and parameter optimization per ambiguous
word (Daelemans et al, 2003).
3.2 Feature Construction
For the feature vector construction, we combine lo-
cal context features that were extracted from the En-
glish sentence and a set of binary bag-of-words fea-
tures that were extracted from the aligned transla-
tions in the four other languages (that are not the
target language of the classifier).
3.2.1 Local Context Features
We extract the same set of local context features
from both the English training and test instances. All
English sentences were preprocessed by means of a
memory-based shallow parser (MBSP) (Daelemans
and van den Bosch, 2005) that performs tokeniza-
tion, Part-of-Speech tagging and text chunking. The
preprocessed English instances were used as input
to build a set of commonly used WSD features:
? features related to the focus word itself being
the word form of the focus word, the lemma,
Part-of-Speech and chunk information,
? local context features related to a window of
three words preceding and following the focus
word containing for each of these words their
full form, lemma, Part-of-Speech and chunk in-
formation
These local context features are to be considered
as a basic feature set. The Senseval evaluation ex-
ercises have shown that feeding additional informa-
tion sources to the classifier results in better system
performance (Agirre and Martinez, 2004). In fu-
ture experiments we plan to integrate a.o. lemma
information on the surrounding content words and
semantic analysis (e.g. Singular Value Decomposi-
tion (Gliozzo et al, 2005)) in order to detect latent
correlations between terms.
3.2.2 Translation Features
In addition to the commonly deployed local con-
text features, we also extracted a set of binary bag-
of-words features from the aligned translations that
are not the target language of the classifier (e.g.
for the French classifier, we extract bag-of-words
features from the Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Ger-
man aligned translations). We preprocessed all
aligned translations by means of the Treetagger
tool (Schmid, 1994) that outputs Part-of-Speech and
55
lemma information. Per ambiguous focus word, a
list of all content words (nouns, adjectives, adverbs
and verbs) that occurred in the aligned translations
of the English sentences containing this word, was
extracted. This resulted in one binary feature per se-
lected content word per language. For the construc-
tion of the translation features for the training set,
we used the Europarl aligned translations.
As we do not dispose of similar aligned trans-
lations for our test instances (where we only have
the English test sentences at our disposal), we had
to adopt a different strategy. We decided to use
the Google Translate API to automatically generate
translations for all English test instances in the five
target languages. This automatic translation pro-
cess can be done using whatever machine translation
tool, but we chose the Google API because of its
easy integration. Online machine translation tools
have already been used before to create artificial
parallel corpora that were used for NLP tasks such
as for instance Named Entity Recognition (Shah et
al., 2010). Similarly, Navigli and Ponzetto (2010)
used the Google Translate API to enrich BabelNet, a
wide-coverage multilingual semantic network, with
lexical information for all languages.
Once the automatic aligned translations were gen-
erated, we preprocessed them in the same way as we
did for the aligned training translations. In a next
step, we again selected all content words from these
translations and constructed the binary bag-of-words
features.
4 Evaluation
To evaluate the two machine translation systems as
well as the ParaSense system on their performance
on the lexical sample of twenty ambiguous words,
we used the sense inventory and test set of the Sem-
Eval Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation
task. The sense inventory was built up on the ba-
sis of the Europarl corpus: all retrieved translations
of a polysemous word were manually grouped into
clusters, which constitute different senses of that
given word. The test instances were selected from
the JRC-ACQUIS Multilingual Parallel Corpus2 and
BNC3. There were in total 50 test instances for each
2http://wt.jrc.it/lt/Acquis/
3http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/
of the twenty ambiguous words in the sample. To la-
bel the test data, native speakers assigned three valid
translations from the predefined clusters of Europarl
translations to each test instance. A more detailed
description of the construction of the data set can
be found in (Lefever and Hoste, 2010a). As eval-
uation metric, we used a straightforward accuracy
measure that divides the number of correct answers
by the total amount of test instances. As a baseline,
we selected the most frequent lemmatized transla-
tion that resulted from the automated word align-
ment (GIZA++).
The output of the ParaSense WSD module con-
sists of a lemmatized translation of the ambiguous
focus word in the target language. The output of
the two statistical machine translation systems,
however, is a translation of the full English input
sentence. Therefore we manually selected the
translation of the ambiguous focus word from the
full translation, and made sure the translation was
put in its base form (masculine singular form for
nouns and adjectives, infinitive form for verbs).
Table 2 lists the accuracy figures for the baseline,
two flavors of the ParaSense system (with and with-
out correction of the word alignment output), Moses
and Google for English?French and English?Dutch.
A first conclusion is that all systems beat the
most frequent sense baseline. As expected, the
Google system (where there was no limitation on
the training data) achieves the best results, but for
French the considerable difference in training size
only leads to modest performance gains compared
to the ParaSense System. Another interesting obser-
vation is that the ParaSense system that uses manu-
ally verified translation labels hardly beats the sys-
tem that uses automatically generated class labels.
This is promising as it makes the manual interven-
tions on the data superfluous and leads to a fully au-
tomatic system development process.
Figure 1 illustrates the accuracy figures for French
for all three systems (for the ParaSense system we
used the flavor that incorporates the non-validated
translation labels) on all individual test words.
The three curves follow a similar pattern, except
for some words where Moses (mood, scene, side) or
both Moses and ParaSense (figure) perform worse.
As the curves show, some words (e.g. coach, figure,

while others obtain very high scores (e.g. letter, mis-
sion, soil). The almost perfect scores for the latter
can be explained by the fact that these words all have
a very generic translation in French (respectively let-
tre, mission, sol) that can be used for all senses of
the word, although there might be more suited trans-
lations for each of the senses depending on the con-
text. As the manual annotators could pick three good
translations for each test instance, the most generic
translation often figures between the gold standard
translations.
The low scores for some other words can often be
explained through the relationship with the number
of training instances (corresponding to the frequency

ity (number of translations) per word. As is shown
in Table 3, both for coach and match there are very
few examples in the corpus, while figure and range
57
are very ambiguous (respectively 167 and 145 trans-
lations to choose from).
The main novelty of our ParaSense system lies in
the application of a multilingual approach to per-
form WSD, as opposed to the more classical ap-
proach that only uses monolingual local context fea-
tures. Consequently we also ran a set of additional
experiments to examine the contribution of the dif-
ferent translation features to the WSD performance.
Table 4 shows the accuracy figures for French and
Dutch for a varying number of translation features
including the other four languages: Italian, Span-
ish, French and Dutch for the French classifier or
French for the Dutch classifier. The scores clearly
confirm the validity of our hypothesis: the classifiers
using translation features are constantly better than
the one that merely uses English local context fea-
tures. For French, the other two romance languages
seem to contribute most: the classifier that uses Ital-
ian and Spanish bag-of-words features achieves the
best performance (75.50%), whereas the classifier
that incorporates German and Dutch translations ob-
tains the worst scores (71.90%). For Dutch, the in-
terpretation of the scores is less straightforward: the
Italian-German combination achieves the best result
(69%), but the difference with the other classifiers
that use two romance languages (Italian-Spanish:
67.70% and Italian-French: 67.20%) is less salient
than for French. In order to draw final conclusions
on the contribution of the different languages, we
probably first need to optimize our feature base and
classification parameters. For the current experi-
ments, we use very sparse bag-of-words features that
can be optimized in different ways (e.g. feature se-
lection, reduction of the bag-of-words features by
applying semantic analysis such as Singular Value
Decomposition, etc.).
5 Conclusion
We presented a thorough evaluation of two statis-
tical Machine Translation systems and one dedi-
cated WSD system on a lexical sample of English
ambiguous nouns. Our WSD system incorporates
both monolingual local context features and bag-
of-words features that are built from aligned trans-
lations in four additional languages. The best re-
sults are obtained by Google, the SMT system that

tational resources. Although there is still a lot of
room for improvement on the feature base and op-
timization of the WSD classifiers, our results show
that the ParaSense system outperforms Moses that is
built with the same training corpus.
We also noticed large differences among the test
words, often related to the number of training in-
stances and the number of translations the classifier
(or decoder) has to choose from.
Additional experiments with the ParaSense sys-
tem incorporating a number of varying translations
features allow us to confirm the validity of our hy-
pothesis. The classifiers that use the multilingual
bag-of-words features clearly outperform the clas-
sifier that only uses local context features.
In future work, we want to expand our feature set
and apply a genetic algorithm to perform joint fea-
ture selection, parameter optimization and instance
58
selection. In addition, we will apply semantic anal-
ysis tools (such as SVD or LSA) on our multilingual
bag-of-words sets in order to detect latent semantic
topics in the multilingual feature base. Finally, we
want to evaluate to which extent the integration of
our WSD output helps the decoder to pick the cor-
rect translation in a real SMT framework.
