Abstract
Detecting emotions in microblogs and so-
cial media posts has applications for industry,
health, and security. However, there exists no
microblog corpus with instances labeled for
emotions for developing supervised systems.
In this paper, we describe how we created such
a corpus from Twitter posts using emotion-
word hashtags. We conduct experiments to
show that the self-labeled hashtag annotations
are consistent and match with the annotations
of trained judges. We also show how the Twit-
ter emotion corpus can be used to improve
emotion classification accuracy in a different
domain. Finally, we extract a word?emotion
association lexicon from this Twitter corpus,
and show that it leads to significantly better
results than the manually crafted WordNet Af-
fect lexicon in an emotion classification task.1
1 Introduction
We use language not just to convey facts, but also
our emotions. Automatically identifying emotions
expressed in text has a number of applications, in-
cluding customer relation management (Bougie et
al., 2003), determining popularity of products and
governments (Mohammad and Yang, 2011), and
improving human-computer interaction (Vela?squez,
1997; Ravaja et al., 2006).
Twitter is an online social networking and mi-
croblogging service where users post and read mes-
sages that are up to 140 characters long. The mes-
sages are called tweets.
1Email the author to obtain a copy of the hash-tagged tweets
or the emotion lexicon: saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.
Often a tweet may include one or more words im-
mediately preceded with a hash symbol (#). These
words are called hashtags. Hashtags serve many
purposes, but most notably they are used to indicate
the topic. Often these words add to the information
in the tweet: for example, hashtags indicating the
tone of the message or their internal emotions.
From the perspective of one consuming tweets,
hashtags play a role in search: Twitter allows peo-
ple to search tweets not only through words in the
tweets, but also through hashtagged words. Con-
sider the tweet below:
We are fighting for the 99% that have been
left behind. #OWS #anger
A number of people tweeting about the Occupy
Wall Street movement added the hashtag #OWS to
their tweets. This allowed people searching for
tweets about the movement to access them simply
by searching for the #OWS hashtag. In this partic-
ular instance, the tweeter (one who tweets) has also
added an emotion-word hashtag #anger, possibly to
convey that he or she is angry.
Currently there are more than 200 million Twitter
accounts, 180 thousand tweets posted every day, and
18 thousand Twitter search queries every second.
Socio-linguistic researchers point out that Twitter is
primarily a means for people to converse with other
individuals, groups, and the world in general (Boyd
et al., 2010). As tweets are freely accessible to all,
the conversations can take on non-traditional forms
such as discussions developing through many voices
rather than just two interlocuters. For example, the
use of Twitter and Facebook has been credited with
246
providing momentum to the 2011 Arab Spring and
Occupy Wall Street movements (Skinner, 2011; Ray,
2011). Understanding how such conversations de-
velop, how people influence one another through
emotional expressions, and how news is shared to
elicit certain emotional reactions, are just some of
the compelling reasons to develop better models for
the emotion analysis of social media.
Supervised methods for emotion detection tend to
perform better than unsupervised ones. They use
ngram features such as unigrams and bigrams (indi-
vidual words and two-word sequences) (Aman and
Szpakowicz, 2007; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Mo-
hammad, 2012b). However, these methods require
labeled data where utterances are marked with the
emotion they express. Manual annotation is time-
intensive and costly. Thus only a small amount of
such text exists. Further, supervised algorithms that
rely on ngram features tend to classify accurately
only if trained on data from the same domain as the
target sentences (Mohammad, 2012b). Thus even
the limited amount of existing emotion-labeled data
is unsuitable for use in microblog analysis.
In this paper, we show how we automatically cre-
ated a large dataset of more than 20,000 emotion-
labeled tweets using hashtags. We compiled labeled
data for six emotions?joy, sadness, anger, fear, dis-
gust, and surprise?argued to be the most basic (Ek-
man, 1992). We will refer to our dataset as the Twit-
ter Emotion Corpus (TEC). We show through ex-
periments that even though the tweets and hashtags
cover a diverse array of topics and were generated
by thousands of different individuals (possibly with
very different educational and socio-economic back-
grounds), the emotion annotations are consistent and
match the intuitions of trained judges. We also show
how we used the TEC to improve emotion detection
in a domain very different from social media.
Finally, we describe how we generated a large lex-
icon of ngrams and associated emotions from TEC.
This emotion lexicon can be used in many applica-
tions, including highlighting words and phrases in a
piece of text to quickly convey regions of affect. We
show that the lexicon leads to significantly better re-
sults than that obtained using the manually crafted
WordNet Affect lexicon in an emotion classification
task.
2 Related Work
Emotion analysis can be applied to all kinds of text,
but certain domains and modes of communication
tend to have more overt expressions of emotions
than others. Genereux and Evans (2006), Mihalcea
and Liu (2006), and Neviarouskaya et al. (2009) ana-
lyzed web-logs. Alm et al. (2005) and Francisco and
Gerva?s (2006) worked on fairy tales. Boucouvalas
(2002), John et al. (2006), and Mohammad (2012a)
explored emotions in novels. Zhe and Boucouvalas
(2002), Holzman and Pottenger (2003), and Ma et al.
(2005) annotated chat messages for emotions. Liu et
al. (2003) and Mohammad and Yang (2011) worked
on email data. Kim et al. (2009) analyzed sadness in
posts reacting to news of Michael Jackson?s death.
Tumasjan et al. (2010) study Twitter as a forum for
political deliberation.
Much of this work focuses on six Ekman emo-
tions. There is less work on complex emotions, for
example, work by Pearl and Steyvers (2010) that fo-
cuses on politeness, rudeness, embarrassment, for-
mality, persuasion, deception, confidence, and dis-
belief. Bolen et al. (2009) measured tension, depres-
sion, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion in tweets.
One of the advantages of our work is that we can eas-
ily collect tweets with hashtags for many emotions,
well beyond the basic six.
Go et al. (2009) and Gonza?lez-Iba?n?ez et al. (2011)
noted that sometimes people use the hashtag #sar-
casm to indicate that their tweet is sarcastic. They
collected tweets with hashtags of #sarcasm and
#sarcastic to create a dataset of sarcastic tweets. We
follow their ideas and collect tweets with hashtags
pertaining to different emotions. Additionally, we
present several experiments to validate that the emo-
tion labels in the corpus are consistent and match
intuitions of trained judges.
3 Existing Emotion-Labeled Text
The SemEval-2007 Affective Text corpus has news-
paper headlines labeled with the six Ekman emo-
tions by six annotators (Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2007). More precisely, for each headline?emotion
pair, the annotators gave scores from 0 to 100 indi-
cating how strongly the headline expressed the emo-
tion. The inter-annotator agreement as determined
by calculating the Pearson?s product moment corre-

Table 1: Inter-annotator agreement (Pearson?s correla-
tion) amongst 6 annotators on the 1000-headlines dataset.
lation (r) between the scores given by each anno-
tator and the average of the other five annotators is
shown in Table 1. For our experiments, we consid-
ered scores greater than 25 to indicate that the head-
line expresses the corresponding emotion.
The dataset was created for an unsupervised com-
petition, and consisted of 250 headlines of trial data
and 1000 headlines of test data. We will refer to
them as the 250-headlines and the 1000-headlines
datasets respectively. However, the data has also
been used in a supervised setting through (1) ten-
fold cross-validation on the 1000-headlines dataset
and (2) using the 1000 headlines as training data and
testing on the 250-headlines dataset (Chaffar and
Inkpen, 2011).
Other datasets with sentence-level annotations of
emotions include about 4000 sentences from blogs,
compiled by Aman and Szpakowicz (2007); 1000
sentences from stories on topics such as educa-
tion and health, compiled by Neviarouskaya et al.
(2009); and about 4000 sentences from fairy tales,
annotated by Alm and Sproat (2005).
4 Creating the Twitter Emotion Corpus
Sometimes people use hashtags to notify others of
the emotions associated with the message they are
tweeting. Table 2 shows a few examples. On reading
just the message before the hashtags, most people
will agree that the tweeter #1 is sad, tweeter #2 is
happy, and tweeter #3 is angry.
However, there also exist tweets such as the fourth
example, where reading just the message before the
hashtag does not convey the emotions of the tweeter.
Here, the hashtag provides information not present
(implicitly or explicitly) in the rest of the message.
1. Feeling left out... #sadness
2. My amazing memory saves the day again! #joy
3. Some jerk stole my photo on tumblr. #anger
4. Mika used my photo on tumblr. #anger
5. School is very boring today :/ #joy
6. to me.... YOU are ur only #fear
Table 2: Example tweets with emotion-words hashtags.
There are also tweets, such as those shown in ex-
amples 5 and 6, that do not seem to express the
emotions stated in the hashtags. This may occur
for many reasons including the use of sarcasm or
irony. Additional context is required to understand
the full emotional import of many tweets. Tweets
tend to be very short, and often have spelling mis-
takes, short forms, and various other properties that
make such text difficult to process by natural lan-
guage systems. Further, it is probable, that only
a small portion of emotional tweets are hashtagged
with emotion words.
Our goal in this paper is to determine if we can
successfully use emotion-word hashtags as emotion
labels despite the many challenges outlined above:
? Can we create a large corpus of emotion-
labeled hashtags?
? Are the emotion annotations consistent, de-
spite the large number of annotators, despite no
control over their socio-economic and cultural
background, despite the many ways in which
hashtags are used, and despite the many id-
iosyncracies of tweets?
? Do the hashtag annotations match with the in-
tuitions of trained judges?
We chose to collect tweets with hashtags corre-
sponding to the six Ekman emotions: #anger, #dis-
gust, #fear, #happy, #sadness, and #surprise.
Eisenstein et al. (2010) collected about 380,000
tweets2 from Twitter?s official API.3 Similarly, Go
et al. (2009) collected 1.6 million tweets.4 However,
these datasets had less than 50 tweets that contained
emotion-word hashtags. Therefore, we abandoned
the search-in-corpora approach in favor of the one
described below.

4.1 Hashtag-based Search on the Twitter
Search API
The Archivist5 is a free online service that helps
users extract tweets using Twitter?s Search API.6
For any given query, Archivist first obtains up to
1500 tweets from the previous seven days. Sub-
sequently, it polls the Twitter Search API every
few hours to obtain newer tweets that match the
query. We supplied Archivist with the six hashtag
queries corresponding to the Ekman emotions, and
collected about 50,000 tweets from those posted be-
tween November 15, 2011 and December 6, 2011.
We discarded tweets that had fewer than three
valid English words. We used the Roget Thesaurus
as the lexicon of English words.7 This helped filter
out most, if not all, of the non-English tweets that
had English emotion hashtags. It also eliminated
very short phrases, and some expressions with very
bad spelling. We discarded tweets with the prefix
?Rt?, ?RT?, and ?rt?, which indicate that the mes-
sages that follow are re-tweets (re-postings of tweets
sent earlier by somebody else). Like Gonza?lez-
Iba?n?ez et al. (2011), we removed tweets that did not
have the hashtag of interest at the end of the mes-
sage. It has been suggested that middle-of-tweet
hashtags may not be good labels of the tweets.8 Fi-
nally, we were left with about 21,000 tweets, which
formed the Twitter Emotion Corpus (TEC).
4.2 Distribution of emotion-word hashtags
Table 3 presents some details of the TEC. Observe
that the distribution of emotions in the TEC is very
different from the distribution of emotions in the
1000-headlines corpus (see Table 1). There are more
messages tagged with the hashtag #joy than any of
the other Ekman emotions.
Synonyms can often be used to express the same
concept or emotion. Thus it is possible that the true
distribution of hashtags corresponding to emotions
is different from what is shown in Table 3. In the
future, we intend to collect tweets with synonyms of
joy, sadness, fear, etc., as well.

5 Consistency and Usefulness of Emotion
Hashtagged Tweets
As noted earlier, even with trained judges, emotion
annotation obtains only a modest inter-annotator
agreement (see Table 1). As shown in Table 3, the
TEC has about 21,000 tweets from about 19,000 dif-
ferent people. If TEC were to be treated as manu-
ally annotated data (which in one sense, it is), then
it is data created by a very large number of judges,
and most judges have annotated just one instance.
Therefore, an important question is to determine
whether the hashtag annotations of the tens of thou-
sands of tweeters are consistent with one another. It
will also be worth determining if this large amount
of emotion-tagged Twitter data can help improve
emotion detection in sentences from other domains.
To answer these questions, we conducted two
automatic emotion classification experiments de-
scribed in the two sub-sections below. For these ex-
periments, we created binary classifiers for each of
the six emotions using Weka (Hall et al., 2009).9 For
example, the Fear?NotFear classifier determined
whether a sentence expressed fear or not. Note
that, for these experiments, we treated the emotion
hashtags as class labels and removed them from the
tweets. Thus a classifier has to determine that a
tweet expresses anger, for example, without having
access to the hashtag #anger.
We chose Support Vector Machines (SVM) with
Sequential Minimal Optimization (Platt, 1999) as
the machine learning algorithm because of its suc-
cessful application in various research problems. We
used binary features that captured the presence or
absence of unigrams and bigrams.

In order to set a suitable benchmark for experi-
ments with the TEC corpus, we first applied the clas-
sifiers to the SemEval-2007 Affective Text corpus.
We executed ten-fold cross-validation on the 1000-
headlines dataset. We experimented with using all
ngrams, as well as training on only those ngrams that
occurred more than once.
The rows under I in Table 4 give a breakdown
of results obtained by the EmotionX?NotEmotionX
classifiers. when they ignored single-occurrence n-
grams (where X is one of the six basic emotions).
#gold is the number of headlines expressing a par-
ticular emotion X . #right is the number of instances
that the classifier correctly marked as expressing X .
#guesses is the number of instances marked as ex-

show a breakdown of results by emotions for II and
III due to space constraints.
It is not surprising that the emotion classes with
the most training instances and the highest inter-
annotator agreement (joy, sadness, and fear) are also
the classes on which the classifiers perform best (see
Table 1).
The F-score of 40.1 obtained using all ngrams
is close to 39.6 obtained by Chaffar and Inkpen
(2011)?a sanity check for our baseline system. Ig-
noring words that occur only once in the train-
ing data seems beneficial. All classification results
shown ahead are for the cases when ngrams that oc-
curred only once were filtered out.
5.1 Experiment I: Can a classifier learn to
predict emotion hashtags?
We applied the binary classifiers described above to
the TEC. Table 5 shows ten-fold cross-validation re-
sults. Observe that even though the TEC was cre-
ated from tens of thousands of users, the automatic
classifiers are able to predict the emotions (hash-
tags) with F-scores much higher than the random
baseline, and also higher than those obtained on the
1000-headlines corpus. Note also that this is de-
spite the fact that the random baseline for the 1000-
headlines corpus (F = 30.3) is higher than the ran-
dom baseline for the TEC (F = 21.7). The results
suggest that emotion hashtags assigned to tweets are
consistent to a degree such that they can be used for
detecting emotion hashtags in other tweets.

gets the best results as it has the highest number of
training instances. The Sadness?NotSadness clas-
sifier performed relatively poorly considering the
amount of training instances available, whereas the
Fear-NotFear classifier performed relatively well. It
is possible that people use less overt cues in tweets
when they are explicitly giving it a sadness hashtag.
5.2 Experiment II: Can TEC improve emotion
classification in a new domain?
As mentioned earlier, supervised algorithms per-
form well when training and test data are from the
same domain. However, certain domain adaptation
algorithms may be used to combine training data in
the target domain with large amounts of training data
from a different source domain.
The Daume? (2007) approach involves the trans-
formation of the original training instance feature
vector into a new space made up of three copies of
the original vector. The three copies correspond to
the target domain, the source domain, and the gen-
eral domain. If X represents an original feature vec-
tor from the target domain, then it is transformed
into XOX, where O is a zero vector. If X repre-
sents original feature vector from the source domain,
then it is transformed into OXX. This data is given
to the learning algorithm, which learns information
specific to the target domain, specific to the source
domain, as well as information that applies to both
domains. The test instance feature vector (which
is from the target domain) is transformed to XOX.
Therefore, the classifier applies information specific
to the target domain as well as information common
to both the target and source domains, but not infor-
mation specific only to the source domain.
In this section, we describe experiments on us-
ing the Twitter Emotion Corpus for emotion clas-
sification in the newspaper headlines domain. We
applied our binary emotion classifiers on unseen
test data from the newspaper headlines domain?the
250-headlines dataset?using each of the following
as a training corpus:
? Target-domain data: the 1000-headlines data.
? Source-domain data: the TEC.
? Target and Source data: A joint corpus of the
1000-headlines dataset and the TEC.
Additionally, when using the ?Target and Source?
data, we also tested the domain adaptation algo-
rithm proposed in Daume? (2007). Since the Emo-
tionX class (the positive class) has markedly fewer
instances than the NotEmotionX class, we assigned
higher weight to instances of the positive class dur-
ing training.11 The rows under I in Table 6 give the
results. (Row II results are for the experiment de-
scribed in Section 6, and can be ignored for now.)
We see that the macro-averaged F-score when us-
ing target-domain data (row I.a.) is identical to the
score obtained by the random baseline (row III).
However, observe that the precision of the ngram
system is higher than the random system, and its
recall is lower. This suggests that the test data has
many n-grams not previously seen in the training
data. Observe that as expected, using source-domain
data produces much lower scores (row I.b.) than
when using target-domain training data (row I.a.).
Using both target- and source-domain data pro-
duced significantly better results (row I.c.1.) than
11For example, for the anger?NotAnger classifier, if 10 out
of 110 instances have the label anger, then they are each given
a weight of 10, whereas the rest are given a weight of 1.

domain adaptation technique described in Daume?
(2007), obtained even better results (row I.c.2.). (We
used the Fisher Exact Test and a confidence inter-
val of 95% for all precision and recall significance
testing reported in this paper.) The use of TEC
improved both precision and recall over just using
the target-domain text. This shows that the Twitter
Emotion Corpus can be leveraged, preferably with
a suitable domain adaptation algorithm, to improve
emotion classification results even on datasets from
a different domain. It is also a validation of the
premise that the self-labeled emotion hashtags are
consistent, at least to some degree, with the emotion
labels given by trained human judges.
6 Creating the TEC Emotion Lexicon
Word?emotion association lexicons are lists of
words and associated emotions. For example, the
word victory may be associated with the emotions
of joy and relief. These emotion lexicons have many
applications, including automatically highlighting
words and phrases to quickly convey regions of af-
fect in a piece of text. Mohammad (2012b) shows
that these lexicon features can significantly improve
classifier performance over and above that obtained
using ngrams alone.
WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004)
includes 1536 words with associations to the six Ek-
man emotions.12 Mohammad and colleagues com-
piled emotion annotations for about 14,000 words
by crowdsourcing to Mechanical Turk (Mohammad
12http://wndomains.fbk.eu/wnaffect.html
and Turney, 2012; Mohammad and Yang, 2011).13
This lexicon, referred to as the NRC emotion lexi-
con, has annotations for eight emotions (six of Ek-
man, trust, and anticipation) as well as for pos-
itive and negative sentiment.14 Here, we show
how we created an ngram?emotion association lex-
icon from emotion-labeled sentences in the 1000-
headlines dataset and the TEC.
6.1 Method
Given a dataset of sentences and associated emo-
tion labels, we compute the Strength of Association
(SoA) between an n-gram n and an emotion e to be:
SoA(n, e) = PMI (n, e)? PMI (n,?e) (3)
where PMI is the pointwise mutual information.
PMI (n, e) = log
freq(n, e)
freq(n) ? freq(e)
(4)
where freq(n, e) is the number of times n occurs in
a sentence with label e. freq(n) and freq(e) are the
frequencies of n and e in the labeled corpus.
PMI (n,?e) = log
freq(n,?e)
freq(n) ? freq(?e)
(5)
where freq(n,?e) is the number of times n occurs in
a sentence that does not have the label e. freq(?e) is
the number of sentences that do not have the label e.
Thus, equation 4 is simplified to:
SoA(n, e) = log
freq(n, e) ? freq(?e)
freq(e) ? freq(n,?e)

Table 7: Number of word types in emotion lexicons.
Since PMI is known to be a poor estimator of associ-
ation for low-frequency events, we ignored ngrams
that occurred less than five times.
If an n-gram has a stronger tendency to occur in
a sentence with a particular emotion label, than in
a sentence that does not have that label, then that
ngram?emotion pair will have an SoA score that is
greater than zero.
6.2 Emotion lexicons created from the
1000-headlines dataset and the TEC
We calculated SoA scores for the unigrams and bi-
grams in the TEC with the six basic emotions. All
ngram?emotion pairs that obtained scores greater
than zero were extracted to form the TEC emo-
tion lexicon. We repeated these steps for the 1000-
headlines dataset as well. Table 7 shows the number
of word types in the two automatically generated and
the two manually created lexicons. Observe that the
1000-headlines dataset produces very few entries,
whereas the large size of the TEC enables the cre-
ation of a substantial emotion lexicon.
6.3 Evaluating the TEC lexicon
We evaluate the TEC lexicon by using it for clas-
sifying emotions in a setting similar to the one dis-
cussed in the previous section. The test set is the
250-headlines dataset. The training set is the 1000-
headlines dataset. We used binary features that cap-
tured the presence or absence of unigrams and bi-
grams just as before. Additionally, we also used
integer-valued affect features that captured the num-
ber of word tokens in a sentence associated with dif-
ferent emotions labels in the TEC emotion lexicon
and the WordNet Affect lexicon. For example, if a
sentence has two joy words and one surprise word,
then the joy feature has value 2, surprise has value
1, and all remaining affect features have value 0.15
We know from the results in Table 6 (I.a. and I.c)
that using the Twitter Emotion Corpus in addition
15Normalizing by sentence length did not give better results.
to the 1000-headlines training data significantly im-
proves results. Now we investigate if the TEC lex-
icon, which is created from TEC, can similarly im-
prove performance. The rows under II in Table 6
give the results.
Observe that even though the TEC lexicon is a
derivative of the TEC that includes fewer unigrams
and bigrams, the classifiers using the TEC lexicon
produces an F-score (row II.a.) significantly higher
than in the scenarios of I.a. and almost as high as in
I.c.2. This shows that the TEC lexicon successfully
captures the word?emotion associations that are la-
tent in the Twitter Emotion Corpus. We also find that
the the classifiers perform significantly better when
using the TEC lexicon (row II.a.) than when using
the WordNet Affect lexicon (row II.b.), but not as
well as when using the NRC emotion lexicon (row
II.c.). The strong results of the NRC emotion lexi-
con are probably because of its size and because it
was created by direct annotation of words for emo-
tions, which required significant time and effort. On
the other hand, the TEC lexicon can be easily im-
proved further by compiling an even larger set of
tweets using synonyms and morphological variants
of the emotion words used thus far.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
We compiled a large corpus of tweets and associ-
ated emotions using emotion-word hashtags. Even
though the corpus has tweets from several thousand
people, we showed that the self-labeled hashtag an-
notations are consistent. We also showed how the
Twitter emotion corpus can be combined with la-
beled data from a different target domain to improve
classification accuracy. This experiment was espe-
cially telling since it showed that self-labeled emo-
tion hashtags correspond well with annotations of
trained human judges. Finally we extracted a large
word?emotion association lexicon from the Twitter
emotion corpus. Our future work includes collect-
ing tweets with hashtags for various other emotions
and also hashtags that are near-synonyms of the ba-
sic emotion terms described in this paper.
