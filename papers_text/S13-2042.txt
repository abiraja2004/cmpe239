Abstract 
This work introduces a new unsupervised 
approach to multilingual word sense 
disambiguation. Its main purpose is to 
automatically choose the intended sense 
(meaning) of a word in a particular context for 
different languages. It does so by selecting the 
correct Babel synset for the word and the 
various Wiki Page titles that mention the 
word. BabelNet contains all the output 
information that our system needs, in its Babel 
synset. Through Babel synset, we find all the 
possible Synsets for the word in WordNet. 
Using these Synsets, we apply the 
disambiguation method Ppr+Freq to find what 
we need. To facilitate the work with WordNet, 
we use the ISR-WN which offers the 
integration of different resources to WordNet. 
Our system, recognized as the best in the 
competition, obtains results around 69% of 
Recall. 
1 Introduction 
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) focuses on 
resolving the semantic ambiguity of a given word.  
This is an important task in Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) because in many applications, 
such as Automatic Translation, it is essential to 
know the exact meaning of a word in a given 
context. In order to solve semantic ambiguity, 
different systems have been developed. However, 
we can categorize them in two main groups: 
supervised and unsupervised systems. The 
supervised ones need large quantity of hand-tagged 
data in order to gather enough information to build 
rules, train systems, and so on. Unsupervised 
systems, on the other hand, do not need such a 
large amount of hand-tagged datasets. This means 
that, when there aren?t enough corpora to train the 
systems, an unsupervised system is a good option. 
A sub-task of WSD is Multilingual Word Sense 
Disambiguation (MWSD) (Navigli et al, 2013) 
that aims at resolving ambiguities in different 
languages. 
In a language, there are words that have only one 
sense (or meaning), but in other languages, the 
same words can have different senses. For 
example, ?patient? is a word that in English can be 
either a noun or an adjective, but in German, it 
only has one sense - ?viz? (a person that needs 
treatment). This shows that the information 
obtained by combining two languages can be more 
useful for WSD because the word senses in each 
language can complement each other. For it to be 
useful, MWSD needs a multilingual resource that 
contains different languages, such as BabelNet 
(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010; 2012) and 
EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998). 
241
As the preferred disambiguation method, we 
decided to use the Ppr+Freq (Personalized Page 
Rank combined with Frequencies of senses)  
(Guti?rrez, 2012) method because, among 
unsupervised systems, graph-based methods have 
obtained more promising results.  
It is worth mentioning the relevant approaches 
used by the scientific community to achieve 
promising results. One approach used is structural 
interconnections, such as Structural Semantic 
Interconnections (SSI), which create structural 
specifications of the possible senses for each word 
in a context (Navigli and Velardi, 2005). The other 
approaches used are ?Exploring the integration of 
WordNet? (Miller et al, 1990), FrameNet (Laparra 
et al, 2010) and those using Page-Rank such as 
(Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007) and (Agirre and Soroa, 
2009). 
The aforementioned types of graph based 
approaches have achieved relevant results in both 
the SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 competitions (see 
Table 1).

Table 1. Relevant WSD approaches. Recall measure is 
calculated recalls using SensEval-2 (English All Word 
task) guidelines over. 
Experiments using SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 
corpora suggest that Ppr+Freq (Guti?rrez, 2012) 
can lead to better results by obtaining over 64% of 
Recall. Therefore we selected Ppr+Freq as the 
WSD method for our system. 
The key proposal for this work is an 
unsupervised algorithm for MWSD, which uses an 
unsupervised method, Ppr+Freq, for semantic 
disambiguation with resources like BabelNet (as 
sense inventory only) (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010) 
and ISR-WN (as knowledge base) (Guti?rrez et al, 
2011a; 2010a). 
ISR-WN was selected as the default knowledge 
base because of previous NLP research, which 
included: (Fern?ndez et al, 2012; Guti?rrez et al, 
2010b; Guti?rrez et al, 2012; 2011b; 2011c; 
2011d), which achieved relevant results using ISR-
WN as their knowledge base. 
2 System architecture  
By using one of BabelNet (BN) features, our 
technique begins by looking for all the Babel 
synsets (Bs) linked to the lemma of each word in 
the sentence that we need to disambiguate.  
Through the Bs offsets, we can get its 
corresponding WordNet Synset (WNS), which 
would be retrieved from WordNet (WN) using the 
ISR-WN resource. As a result, for each lemma, we 
have a WordNet Synset List (WNSL) from which 
our Word Sense Disambiguation method obtains 
one WNS as the correct meaning. 
Our WSD method consists of applying a 
modification of the Personalizing PageRank (Ppr) 
algorithm (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), which 
involves the senses frequency. More specifically, 
the key proposal is known as Ppr+Freq (see 
Section 2.3).  
Given a set of WNSLs of WNSL, as words 
window, we applied the Synsets ranking method, 
Ppr+Freq, which ranks in a descending order, the 
Synsets of each lemma according to a calculated 
factor of relevance. The first Synset (WNS) of 
each WNSL (the most relevant) is established as 
the correct one and its associated Babel synset (Bs) 
is also tagged as correct. To determine the Wiki 
Page Titles (WK), we examine the WIKI 
(Wikipedia pages) and WIKIRED (Wikipedia 
pages redirections) in the correct Babel synset 
obtained. 
Figure 1 shows a general description of our 
system that is made up of the following steps: 
I. Obtaining lemmas  
II. Obtaing WN Synset of selected lemmas  
III. Applying Ppr+Freq method  
IV. Assigning Synset, Babel synset and Wiki 
page title 
Note that ISR-WN contains WN as its nucleus. 
This allows linking both resources, BabelNet and 
ISR-WN.

2.1 Obtaining lemmas  
For each input sentence, we extract the labeled 
lemmas. As an example, for the sentence, ?The 
struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be 
a near thing,? the selected lemmas are: ?struggle,? 
?drug_lord,? ?Colombia?, and ?near_thing.? 
 
Figure 2. Obtaining synset of lemmas. 
 
2.2 Obtaing WN Synset of selected lemmas  
For each lemma obtained in the previous section, 
we look through BabelNet to recover the Bs that 
contains the lemma among its labels. When BSs 
are mapped to WN, we use the ISR-WN resource 
to find the corresponding Synset. Since a lemma 
can appear in a different Bs, it can be mapped with 
several WNS. Thus, we get a Synset list for each 
lemma in the sentence. In case the lemma does not 
have an associated Bs, its list would be empty. An 
example of this step is shown on Figure 2. 
2.3 Applying Ppr+Freq method 
In the above case, Ppr+Freq modifies the ?classic? 
Page Rank approach instead of assigning the same 
weight for each sense of WN in the disambiguation 
graph (??).

and Soroa, 2009) in Word Sense Disambiguation 
thematic, and which has obtained relevant results, 
was an inspiration to us in our work. The main idea 
behind this algorithm is that, for each edge 
between ?i and ?j in graph ?, a vote is made from 
?i to ?j. As a result, the relevance of ?j is 
increased. 
On top of that, the vote strength from ? to ? 
depends on ???? relevance. The philosophy behind 
it is that, the more important the vertex is, the more 
strength the voter would have. Thus, PageRank is 
generated by applying a random walkthrough from 
the internal interconnection of ?, where the final 
relevance of ??  represents the random walkthrough 
probability over ?, and ending on ??. 
Ppr+Freq includes the existent semantic and 
frequency patterns of each sense of the word to 
disambiguate while finding a way to connect each 
one of these words in a knowledge base. 
The new graph-based approach of WSD 
generates a graph of disambiguated words for each 
input sentence. For that reason, it is necessary to 
classify the word senses according to the other 
words that compose the context. The general 
method is shown in Figure 3. This method is 
divided into three steps: 
I. Creation of a disambiguation graph 
II. Application of Ppr+Freq in the generated 
graph 
III. Selection of the correct answer 
Creation of a disambiguation graph: In the first 
step, a disambiguation graph is built by means of a 
Breath First Search (BFS) over the ?super? graph 
composed by all the resources integrated into ISR-
WN. The components involved in this process are: 
WordNet, SUMO (Zouaq et al, 2009) WordNet 
Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) WordNet 
Affects (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) Semantic 
Classes (Izquierdo et al, 2007) and eXtended 
WordNet (XWN) relations (Moldovan and Rus, 
2001). This search aims to recover all senses 
(nodes), domain labels (from WordNet Domain 
and WordNet Affects), SUMO categories, and 
Semantic Classes labels through the shortest path 
between every pair of senses in the WNSL set 
associated with the input sentence. Using ISR-WN 
as the KB, through experimentation, we obtained 
the shortest paths with a length of five edges. For a 
better understanding of this process, see (Guti?rrez, 
2012). 
Application of Ppr+Freq in the generated 
graph: In the second step, we use the weighted 
Personalized PageRank. Here, all the vertices from 
vector ? in ?? are initialized with the value  
1
?
 ; 
where ? is the number of nodes in ??. On the 
other hand, the vertices that represent word senses 
in the analyzed sentence are not initialized with 
this value. Instead, they are initialized with values 
in the range [0?1], which are associated to their 
occurrence frequency in SemCor1 (Corpus and 
sense frequencies knowledge). In the last step, 
after applying the Ppr+Freq algorithm over ??, we 
get a representative vector which contains ISR-WN 
nodes in ?? sorted in a descending order by a 
ranking score computed by this algorithm. For a 
better description, see (Guti?rrez, 2012). 
Selection of the correct answer: As the correct 
sense, we take the highest ranked sense of each 
target word involved in this vector. Note that 
domain labels, SUMO categories, semantic class 
labels, and affect labels are ranked too. They could 
be used in the future to determine relevant 
conceptualizations that would be useful for text 
classification and more. 
In our system, we assume the following 
configuration: dumping factor ? = 0.85 and like in 
(Agirre and Soroa, 2009) we used 30 iterations. A 
detailed explanation about PageRank algorithm 
can be found in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009). 
Table 2 shows an example that analyzes the 
Synset for each word in the sentence and also 
shows how the higher ranked Synsets of the target 
words are selected as the correct ones. For a 
detailed explanation of Ppr+Freq, see (Guti?rrez, 
2012). 
2.4 Assigning Synset, Babel synset and Wiki 
Pages 
In this step, English is handled differently from 
other languages because WordNet Synsets are 
available only for English. The following sections 
explain how we proceed in each case. Once the 
Synsets list is obtained for each lemma in section 
2.3, selecting the correct answer for the lemma is 
all that?s left to do.

Figure 3. General process of WSD with Ppr+Freq. 
2.4.1 English 
Given a lemma, we go through its Synset list from 
beginning to end looking for the first Synset that 
contains a key2 for the lemma. If such Synset 
exists, it is designated as the Synset for the lemma. 
Otherwise, no Synset is assigned. 
As already explained, each Synset in the list is 
connected to a Bs. Therefore, the lemma linked 
with the correct WNS selected in the previous step, 
is chosen as the correct lemma. In case no Synsets 
were designated as the correct ones, we take the 
first Bs in BN, which contains the lemma among 
its labels.  
To determine the Wiki pages titles (WK) we 
examine the WIKIRED and WIKI labels in the 
correct Bs selected in the preceding step. This 
search is restricted only to labels corresponding to 
the analyzed language and discriminating upper 
and lower case letters. Table 2 shows some sample 
results of the WSD process.

2A sense_key is the best way to represent a sense in 
semantic tagging or other systems that refer to WordNet 
senses. sense_key?s are independent of WordNet sense 
numbers and synset_offset?s, which vary between versions of 
the database. 
2.4.2 Other languages  
For this scenario, we introduce a change in the first 
step discussed in the previous section. The reason 
is that the Synsets do not contain any keys in any 
other language than English. Thus, the correct 
Synset for the lemma is the first in the Synset list 
for the lemma obtained, as described, in section 
2.3. 
3 Results 
We tested three versions (runs) of the proposed 
approach and evaluated them through a trial 
dataset provided by Task123 of Semeval-2013 
using babelnet-1.0.1. Table 3 shows the result for 
each run. Note that the table results were 
calculated with the traditional WSD recall 
measure, being this measure which has ranked 
WSD systems on mostly Semeval competitions. 
On the other hand, note that our precision and 
recall results are different because the coverage is 
not 100%. See Table 5.

than Run1 in the WK with a 78% in English and 
Bs with 60% in French. The best results are in the 
WK in French with a value of 85%. 
Since we can choose to include different 
resources into ISR-WN, it is important to analyze 
how doing so would affect the results. Table 4 
shows comparative results for Run 2 of a trial 
dataset with BabelNet version 1.1.1. 
As can be observed in Table 4, the result does not 
have a significant change even though we used the 
ISR-WN with all resources.  
A better analysis of Ppr+Freq in, as it relates to 
the influence of each resource involved in ISR-WN 
(similar to Table 4 description) assessing 
SensEval-2 and SensEval-3 dataset, is shown in 
(Guti?rrez, 2012). There are different resource 
combinations showing that only XWN1.7 and all 
ISR-WN resources obtain the highest performance. 
Other analysis found in (Guti?rrez, 2012) evaluates 
the influence of adding the sense frequency for 
Ppr+Freq.  
By excluding the Factotum Domain, we obtain 
the best result in Bs 54% for French (only 1% 
more than the version used in the competition). 
The other results are equal, with a 69% in WNS, 
66% in Bs, 64% in WK for English, and 69% in 
WK for French.

3.1 Run1 
In this Run, WNSLs consist of all the target words 
involved in each sentence. This run is applied at 
the sentence level. The results for the competition 
are shown in Table 5. For this Run, the best result 
was obtained for Spanish with a 70.3% in Bs and 
49.3% in WK of Recall. As we can see, for Run1 
the precision is high for Wikipedia disambiguation, 
obtaining for French the best result of the ranking. The 
low Recall in Wikipedia is due to the exact mismatching 
of labels between our system output and the gold 
standard. This fact, affects the rest of our runs. 
3.2 Run2 
In this Run, WNSLs consist of all the target words 
involved in each domain. We can obtain the target 
words because the training and test dataset contain 
the sentences grouped by topics.  For instance, for 
English, 13 WNSLs are established. This Run is 
applied at the corpora level. The results for the 
competition are shown in Table 5. It is important to 
emphasize that our best results ranked our 
algorithm as first place among all proposed 
approaches for the MWSD task. 
For this run, the best Recall was obtained for 
Spanish with a 70.8% in Bs and 50.2% in WK. 
This Run also has the best result of the three runs. 
For the English competition, it ended up with a 
64.5% in WNS, 68.5% in Bs, and 48.7% in WK. 
This Run obtained promising results, which took 
first place in the competition. It also had better 
results than that of the First Sense (Most Frequent 
Sense) baseline in Bs results for all languages, 
except for German. In Bs, it only obtained lower 
results in German with a 62% of Recall for our 
system and 67.3% for the First Sense baseline. 
3.3 Run3 
In this run, WNSLs consist of all the words 
included in each sentence. This run uses target 
words and non-target words of each sentence, as 
they are applied to the sentence level. The results 
for the competition are shown in Table 5.  
As we can see, the behavior of this run is similar 
to the previous runs. 
4 Conclusions and Future work  
The above results suggest that our proposal is a 
promising approach. It is also important to notice 
that a richer knowledgebase can be built by 
combining different resources such as BabelNet 
and ISR-WN, which can lead to an improvement 
of the results. Notwithstanding, our system has 
been recognized as the best in the competition, 
obtaining results around 70% of Recall. 
According to the Task12 results4, only the 
baseline Most Frequent Sense (MFS) could 
improve our scores in order to achieve better WK 
and German (DE) disambiguation. Therefore, we 
plan to review this point to figure out why we 
obtained better results in other categories, but not 
for this one. At the same time, further work will 
use the internal Babel network to run the Ppr+Freq 
method in an attempt to find a way to enrich the 
semantic network obtained for each target sentence 
to disambiguate. On top of that, we plan to 
compare Ppr (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) with 
Ppr+Freq using the Task12 dataset.
