Abstract
We present the results of several machine
learning tasks designed to predict rhetori-
cal relations that hold between clauses in
discourse. We demonstrate that organizing
rhetorical relations into different granularity
categories (based on relative degree of detail)
increases average prediction accuracy from
58% to 70%. Accuracy further increases to
80% with the inclusion of clause types. These
results, which are competitive with existing
systems, hold across several modes of written
discourse and suggest that features of informa-
tion structure are an important consideration
in the machine learnability of discourse.
1 Introduction
The rhetorical relations that hold between clauses
in discourse index temporal and event information
and contribute to a discourse?s pragmatic coherence
(Hobbs, 1985). For example, in (1) the NARRATION
relation holds between (1a) and (1b) as (1b) tempo-
rally follows (1a) at event time.
(1) a. Pascale closed the toy chest.
b. She walked to the gate.
c. The gate was locked securely.
d. So she couldn?t get into the kitchen.
The ELABORATION relation, describing the sur-
rounding state of affairs, holds between (1b) and
(1c). (1c) is temporally inclusive (subordinated)
with (1b) and there is no temporal progression at
event time. The RESULT relation holds between (1b-
c) and (1d). (1d) follows (1b) and its subordinated
ELABORATION relation (1c) at event time.
Additional pragmatic information is encoded in
these relations in terms of granularity. Granularity
refers to the relative increases or decreases in the
level of described detail. For example, moving from
(1b) to (1c), we learn more information about the
gate via the ELABORATION relation. Also, moving
from (1b-c) to (1d) there is a consolidation of infor-
mation associated with the RESULT relation.
Through several supervised machine learning
tasks, we investigate the degree to which granularity
(as well as additional elements of discourse struc-
ture (e.g. tense, aspect, event)) serves as a viable
organization and predictor of rhetorical relations in
a range of written discourses. This paper is orga-
nized as follows. Section 2 reviews prior research
on rhetorical relations, discourse structure, granular-
ity and prediction. Section 3 discusses the analyzed
data, the selection and annotation of features, and
the construction of several machine learning tasks.
Section 4 provides the results which are then dis-
cussed in Section 5.
2 Background
Rhetorical relation prediction has received consid-
erable attention and has been shown to be useful
for text summarization (Marcu, 1998). Prediction
tasks rely on a number of features (discourse con-
nectives, part of speech, etc.) (Marcu and Echihabi,
2002; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004). A wide range
of accuracies are also reported - 33.96% (Marcu and
Echihabi, 2002) to 70.70% (Lapata and Lascarides,
2004) for all rhetorical relations and, for individ-
ual relations, CONTRAST (43.64%) and CONTINU-
ATION (83.35%) (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2005).
44
We seek to predict the inventory of rhetorical
relations defined in Segmented Discourse Repre-
sentation Theory (?SDRT?) (Asher and Lascarides,
2003). In addition to the relations illustrated in
(1), we consider: BACKGROUND: It was Christ-
mas. Pascale got a new toy.; EXPLANATION: The
aardvark was dirty. It fell into a puddle.; CONSE-
QUENCE: If the aardvark fell in the puddle, then it
got dirty.; ALTERNATION: Pascale got an aardvark
or a stuffed bunny.; and CONTINUATION: Pascale
got an aardvark. Grimsby got a rawhide.
Discourses were selected based on Smith (2003)
who defines five primary discourse modes by: (1)
the situations (events and states) they describe; (2)
the overarching temporality (tense, aspect); and (3)
the type of text progression (temporal - text and
event time progression are similar; atemporal - text
and event time progression are not similar). These
contrastive elements inform the features selected
for the machine learning tasks discussed in Section
3.2. The five modes, narratives, reports (news ar-
ticles), description (recipes), information (scientific
essays), and argument (editorials) were selected to
ensure a balanced range of theoretically supported
discourse types.
2.1 Granularity of Information
Granularity in discourse refers to the relative degree
of detail. The higher the level of detail, the more
informative the discourse is. We assume that there
will be some pragmatic constraints on the informa-
tiveness of a discourse (e.g., consistent with Grice?s
(1975) Maxim of Quantity). For our purposes, we
rely specifically on granularity as defined in Mulkar-
Mehta et al (2011) (?MM?) who characterize gran-
ularity in terms of entities and events.
To illustrate, consider (2) where the rhetorical
structure indicates that (2b) is an ELABORATION of
(2a), the NARRATION relation holds between (2b)
and (2c) and (2c) and (2d), and the RESULT relation
between (2d) and (2e).
(2) a. The Pittsburgh Steelers needed to win.
b. Batch took the first snap.
c. Then he threw the ball into the endzone.
d. Ward caught the ball.
e. A touchdown was scored.
Entities and events can stand in part-whole and
causality relationships with entities and events in
subsequent clauses. A positive granularity shift in-
dicates movement from whole to part (more detail)
- e.g., Batch (2b) is a part of the whole Pittsburgh
Steelers (2a). A negative granularity shift indicates
movement from part to whole (less detail), or if
one event causes a subsequent event (if an event is
caused by a subsequent event, this is a positive shift)
- e.g., Ward?s catching of the ball (2d) caused the
scoring of the touchdown (2e). Maintained granular-
ities (not considered by MM) are illustrated in (2b-c)
and (2c-d). Clauses (2b) through (2d) are temporally
linked events, but there is no part-whole shift in, nor
a causal relationship between, the entities or events;
the granularity remains the same.
We maintain that there is a close relationship be-
tween rhetorical relations and granularity. Con-
sequently, rhetorical relations can be organized as
follows: positive: BACKGROUND, ELABORATION,
EXPLANATION; negative: CONSEQUENCE, RE-
SULT; and maintained: ALTERNATION, CONTINU-
ATION, NARRATION. The machine learning tasks
discussed in the remainder of the paper consider this
information in the prediction of rhetorical relations.
3 Data and Methods
Five written discourses of similar sentence length
were selected from each mode for 25 total dis-
courses. The discourses were segmented by inde-
pendent or dependent (subordinate) clauses, if the
clauses contained discourse markers (but, however),
and if the clauses were embedded in the sentence
provided in the orginal written discourse (e.g., John,
who is the director of NASA, gave a speech on Fri-
day). The total number of clauses is 1090, averaging
43.6 clauses per discourse (?=7.2).
3.1 Feature Annotation
For prediction, we use a feature set distilled from
Smith?s classification of discourses: TENSE and
ASPECT; EVENT (from the TimeML annotation
scheme (Pustejovksy, et al, 2005), Aspectual, Oc-
curence, States, etc.); SEQUENCE information as
the clause position normalized to the unit interval;
and discourse MODE. We also include CLAUSE
type - independent (IC) or dependent clauses (DC)
with the inclusion of a discourse marker (M) or not,

categories which are an organization of the SDRT
rhetorical relations (Asher and Lascarides, 2003),
summarized in Table 1.
All 25 discourses were annotated by one of the au-
thors using only a reference sheet. The other author
independently coded 80% of the data (20 discourses,
four from each mode). Average agreement and Co-
hen?s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) statistics were computed
and are within acceptable ranges: TENSE (99.65
/ .9945), ASPECT (99.30 / .9937), SDRT (77.42 /
.6850), and EVENT (75.88 / .6362).
These results are consistent with previously re-
ported annotations for rhetorical relations (Sporleder
and Lascarides, 2005; Howald and Katz, 2011),
event verbs and durations, tense and aspect (Puscasu
and Mititelu, 2008; Wiebe et al, 1997). Positive,
negative and maintained granularities were not an-
notated, but MM report a Kappa between .8500 and
1. The distribution of these granularities, based on
the organization of the annotated rhetorical relations
is presented in Table 1.
3.2 Machine Learning
Three supervised machine learning tasks were con-
structed to predict SDRT relations. The first task
(Uncollapsed) created a 8-way classifier to predict
the SDRT relations based on the feature set, omit-
ting the GRANULARITY feature. The second task
(Collapsed) created a 3-way classifier to predict
the GRANULARITY categories (the SDRT feature
was omitted). The third task (Combined) included

lapsed 8-way classifier. We utilized the WEKA
toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2005) and treated each
clause as a vector of information (SDRT, EVENT,
TENSE, ASPECT, SEQUENCE, CLAUSE, MODE,
GRANULARITY), illustrated in (3)1:

We report results from the Na??ve Bayes (NB), J48
(C4.5 decision tree (Quinlan, 1993)) and K* (Cleary
and Trigg, 1995) classifiers, run at 10-fold cross-
validation.
4 Results
Table 2 indicates that the best average accuracy for
the Uncollapsed task is 58.99 (J48). The accu-
racy increases to 70.18 (K*) for the Collapsed task.
The accuracy increases further to 80.00 (NB) for the
Combined task. All accuracies are statistically sig-
nificant over majority class baselines (?MCB?): Un-
collapsed (MCB = 35) - ?2 = 15.11, d.f. = 0, p ?
.001; Collapsed (MCB = 41) - ?2 = 20.51, d.f. =
0, p ? .001; and Combined (treating the best Col-
lapsed accuracy as the new baseline (MCB = 70)) -
?2 = 1.43, d.f. = 0, p ? .001.
As shown in Table 3, based on the NB 8-way
Combined classifier, the prediction accuracies of

or associated granularity, with the second clause in a clause pair.
Tasks were performed where clause information was paired, but
this did not translate into improved accuracies.

the individual modes are no more than 12 percent-
age points off of the average (80.00). Accura-
cies range from 68% A(rgument) (?=-12) to 92%
D(escription) (?=+12) with N(arrative), R(eport),
and I(nformation) being closest to average (?=-6-
8). For individual relation predictions, NARRATION,
RESULT and BACKGROUND have the highest total
accuracies followed by ELABORATION and CON-
TRAST. Performing less well is CONSEQUENCE,
ALTERNATION and CONTINUATION with EXPLA-
NATION performing the worst. All accuracies are
statistically significant above baseline (?2 = 341.89,
d.f. = 7, p ? .001).
5 Discussion and Conclusion
Using the Collapsed performance as a baseline for
the Combined classifier, we discuss the features
contributing to the 10 percentage point increase as
well as the optimal (minimal) set of features for pre-
diction. The best accuracies for the Combined ex-
periment only require CLAUSE and GRANULAR-
ITY information; achieving 79.08% (NB - 44 above
MCB, f-score=.750). Both CLAUSE and GRANU-
LARITY are necessary. Relying only on CLAUSE
achieves a 48.25% accuracy (J48) and relying only
on GRANULARITY achieves 70.36% for all clas-
sifiers, but this higher accuracy is an artifact of the
organization as evidenced by the f-score (.585).
The relationship between CLAUSE and the
rhetorical relations is straightforward. For example,
the CONSEQUENCE relation is often an ?intersenten-
tial? relation (if the aardvark fell in the puddle, then
it got dirty), each of the 16 CONSEQUENCE relations
are embedded. Similarly, 93% of all ELABORATION
relations, which are temporally subordinating, are
embedded. Clause types appear to be a viable source
of co-varying information in rhetorical relation pre-
diction in the tasks under discussion.
The aspects of syntactic-semantic form and prag-
matic function in the relationship between granular-
ity and rhetorical relations is of central interest in
this investigation. Asher and Lascarides represent
discourses hierarchically through coordination and
subordination of information which corresponds to
changes in granularity. However, while the notion
of granularity enters into the motivation and formu-
lation of the SDRT inventory, it is not developed fur-
ther. These results potentailly allow us to say some-
thing deeper about the structural organization of dis-
course as it relates to granularity.
In particualr, while there is some probabilistic
leverage in collapsing categories, it is not the case
that arbitrary categorizations will perform similarly.
This observation holds true even for theoretically
informed categorizations. For example, organizing
the SDRT inventory into coordinated and subordi-
nated relations yields lower performance on relation
prediction. Coordinated and subordinated can be
predicted with 80% accuracy, but the prediction of
the individual relations given the category performs
only at 70%. Since the granularity-based organiza-
tion presented here performs better, we suggest that
the pragmatic function of the relation is more sys-
tematic than the syntactic-semantic form of the rela-
tion.
Future research will focus on more data, differ-
ent machine learning techniques (e.g. unsupervised
learning) and automatization. Where clause, tense,
aspect and event are readily automatable, rhetorical
relations and granularity are less so. Automatically
extracting such information from an annotated cor-
pus such as the Penn Discourse Tree Bank is cer-
tainly feasible. However, the distribution of genres
in this corpus is somewhat limited (i.e., predomi-
nately news text (Webber, 2009)) and calls into ques-
tion the generalizeability of results to other modes of
discourse. Overall, we have demonstrated that the
inclusion of a granularity-based organization in the
machine learning prediction of rhetorical relations
increases performance by 37%, which is roughly
14% above previous reported results for a broader
range of discourses and relations.
