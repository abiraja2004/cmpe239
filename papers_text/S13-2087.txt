Abstract
In this paper, we describe our system for the
SemEval-2013 Task 2, Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter. We formed features that take into ac-
count the context of the expression and take a
supervised approach towards subjectivity and
polarity classification. Experiments were per-
formed on the features to find out whether
they were more suited for subjectivity or po-
larity Classification. We tested our model for
sentiment polarity classification on Twitter as
well as SMS chat expressions, analyzed their
F-measure scores and drew some interesting
conclusions from them.
1 Introduction
In recent years there has been a huge growth in pop-
ularity of vaious social media microblogging plat-
forms like Twitter. Users freely share their personal
opinions on various events and entities on these plat-
forms. However, while character constraints make
sure the opinions are short and to the point, they also
contribute to the noisy nature of Twitter data.
The contextual polarity of the phrase in which a
particular instance of a word appears may be quite
different from the word?s prior polarity. Positive
words are used in phrases expressing negative sen-
timents, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that
are positive or negative out of context are neutral in
context, meaning they are not even being used to ex-
press a sentiment. This is evident from the example
of underlined phrase in the following tweet:
Lana Del Rey at Hammersmith Apollo in
May...Very badly want tickets
In a technique with large lexicon of words marked
with their prior polarity, badly would have a negative
score making the whole sentence with negative sen-
timent. Even if we perform phrase-level analysis for
the phrase ?Very badly?, Very only acts as an intensi-
fier for badly and the whole sentence is still marked
negative. It?s only when we look further from the
underlined phrase that we realize that ?Very badly?
in the context of wanting something shows positive
sentiment.
Early work on sentiment analysis is based on
document-level analysis of reviews (Pang, B., and
Lee, L., 2004). This approach isn?t feasible for mi-
croblogging data due to the extremely small size of
individual documents. The results on the effective-
ness of part-of-speech features are mixed. While
most regard POS features helpful in subjectivity
classification (Barbosa, L. and Feng, J., 2010), some
report very insignificant improvement on using them
(Kouloumpis, E., Wilson, T. and Moore, J., 2011).
However, most phrase-level approaches began with
a large lexicon of words marked with their prior po-
larity (Kim, S. M., and Hovy, E., 2004; Hu, M., and
Liu, B, 2004). Wilson, Wiebe and Hoffman (2005)
sought to include contextual polarity in the foray by
using various dependency relation based features for
subjectivity and polarity classification. Our goal is
to perform contextual sentiment polarity classifica-
tion in the domain of noisy expressions from tweets
and SMS messages.
2 Data
We use the annotated Twitter expressions provided
by SemEval-2013 Task 2 (Wilson et al, 2013) or-
525
ganizers for training our model. Each instance of
the data contains an expression and its parent tweet.
There are a total of 24939 tweet expressions in the
training dataset and they are annotated into four
classes:
? Objective: Expressions carrying no opinion by
themselves or even in the context of their parent
tweet.
? Positive: Expressions carrying positive senti-
ment in the context of the parent tweet.
? Negative: Expressions carrying negative senti-
ment in the context of the parent tweet.
? Neutral: Expressions carrying prior subjectiv-
ity but are rendered objective in the context of
their parent tweet.
Two separate lexicons for emoticons and interjec-
tions having non-zero prior polarities were created.
47 Subjective emoticons were extracted from train-
ing data as well as from various popular chat ser-
vices. 212 Subjective interjections were extracted
from training data as well from Wiktionary1.
We test our trained model on two separate test
datasets provided by SemEval-2013 Task 2 organiz-
ers, 1) Twitter expressions and 2) SMS expressions.
2.1 Preprocessing
Data preprocessing consists of three steps: 1) To-
kenization, 2) Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and
3) Normalization. For the first two steps we use
Twitter NLP and Part-of-Speech Tagging system
(Gimpel, K., et al, 2011). It is a Tokenizer and
POS Tagger made for Twitter dataset and thus
contains separate POS tags for hash-tags(#), at-
mention(@), URLs and E-Mail addresses(U) and
emoticons(E). The POS Tagger identifies common
abbreviations and tags them accordingly. We use
Twitter NLP and Part-of-Speech Tagging system for
the SMS expressions too due to similar noisy na-
ture of SMS data. For the normalization process,
all upper case letters are converted to lower case,
and instances of repeated characters are replaced
by a repetition of two characters. This is done
1http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:
English_interjections
so that existing legal words having characters re-
peating two times aren?t harmed. #hash-tags are
stripped of the # character and then treated as a nor-
mal word/phrase, at-mention(@) denote the name of
a person/organization and thus they are treated as
proper noun and since URLs don?t carry any senti-
ment, they are ignored in the expression. We expect
the normalization process to aid in forming better
features and in turn improving the performance of
the system as a whole.
3 Features
We use three types of features for our classification
experiments,
? Phrase Prior Polarity Features
? POS Tag Pattern Features
? Noisy data specific Features
Both Phrase Prior Polarity and POS Tag features are
computed for the expression to be analyzed as well
as, if available, two words 2 before and after the ex-
pression.
3.1 Phrase Prior Polarity Feature
Every expression in the dataset is represented by
its aggregate positive and negative polarity score.
Senti-Wordnet (Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., and Se-
bastiani, F., 2010), Emoticon Lexicon and an Inter-
jection Lexicon are used to calculate these prior po-
larities. Bigrams and trigrams are identified by their
presence in Senti-Wordnet. For each identified un-
igram, bigram or trigram, we compute the mean of
all its subjective wordnet sense scores under the POS
tag assigned to it. If a unigram word isn?t present in
Senti-Wordnet, its stemmed3 form is searched keep-
ing the original POS Tag. We perform negation de-
tection by enabling a flag whenever a word occur-
ring in negation list appears. The negation list con-
sists of words like no, not, never, etc, as well all
words ending with -n?t. Negation words act as po-
larity reversers, for e.g., consider the following ex-
pression:?not so sure?. In a simple bag of words ap-
proach, ?not so sure? wouldn?t be classified as neg-
ative due to the presence of sure. To overcome this,
2The figure of two words was reached empirically upon try-
ing various lengths.
3The stemmer used is Snowball Stemmer for English.

prior polarities of all words are reversed on the oc-
currence of a negation word. Some negation words
such as no, not, never, also carry their own negative
score (-1), in case no subjective word is found in the
expression, their individual negative score is added
to the aggregate prior polarity of the expression. Ad-
jectives and adverbs are treated as polarity shifters.
They either shift the prior polarities of nouns and
verbs, or in case of objective nouns and verbs, con-
tribute their own prior polarities to the expression,
e.g., ?exceedingly slow?, ?little truth?, ?amazing
car?, etc.
On encountering any emoticon or interjection in
the expression that is present in our lexicon, its cor-
responding score is added to the aggregate prior po-
larity of the expression.
Finally, both positive and negative prior polarities
of the expression are normalized by the number of
words in the expression after tokenization.
3.2 POS Tag Pattern Feature
Both Tweets and SMS messages are extremely short.
Twitter is a social microblogging platform having
just 140 character space for a tweet while SMS mes-
sages have little word length due to typing con-
straints on a mobile device. All the above factors
contribute to the noisiness of data. Hence, it isn?t
enough to find prior polarities of n-grams occurring
in the expression. We thus formed a heuristic tech-
nique of using POS tag patterns as features. POS tag
patterns carry information regarding POS tags com-
bined with the location of their occurrence in the ex-
pression as a feature. For e.g., the POS tag pattern
for the expression ?not so sure? in the tweet
@thehuwdavies you think the Boro will
beat Swansea? I?m not so sure, Decem-
ber/January is when we implode
will be RRA, where R = Adverb and A = Adjective.
3.3 Noisy data specific Features
Interjections and emoticons are useful indicators of
subjectivity in a sentence. Even if many interjections
or emoticons don?t carry a defininte sentiment polar-
ity, they do indicate that some sort of opinion from
the user is available in the tweet or sms. Some ex-
amples of interjections and emoticons with no fixed
prior polarity are, ?wow?, ?oh my god?, ?:-o?, etc.
4 Experiments and Results
Our goal for these experiments is two-fold. First,
we want to evaluate the effectiveness of our features
when using them for subjectivity classification as
compared to sentiment polarity classification. Sec-
ond, we want to evaluate and compare the perfor-
mance of our learnt model when tested upon Twitter
and SMS expression data. We use Naive Bayes clas-
sifier in Weka (Hall, M., et al, 2009) as the learning
algorithm.
Feature Analysis between Subjectivity and Polar-
ity Classification For our first set of experiments,
we re-label all positive, negative and neutral expres-
sions as subjective for subjectivity classification in
the training dataset. For polarity classification we
remove all objective expressions from the training
dataset and perform 3-way classification between
positive, negative and neutral expressions. In both
cases we perform 10-fold cross validation on the
training dataset. For subjectivity classification we
have 24939 tweet expressions with 15565 objective
and 9374 subjective expressions. Subjective expres-
sions contain 5787 positive, 3131 negative and 456
neutral expressions. Table 1 shows the accuracy of
subjectivity and sentiment polarity classification re-
sults and improvement due to each feature.
It is fairly evident from Table 1 that phrase prior
polarity features are equally important for both sub-
jectivity and sentiment polarity classification. The
same however, doesn?t completely hold true for the
other two feature types. While POS Tag pattern
features provide an improvement of 1.89% in sub-
jectivity classification accuracy, they only provide a
0.64% increase in accuracy in polarity classification.
Many inferences can be drawn from this result and
a deeper analysis is required on POS tag patterns to
prove that this wasn?t a mere aberration. Emoticon
and interjection feature too give lower improvement
in accuracies during sentiment polarity classifica-
tion (0.44%) as compared to subjectivity classifica-
tion (0.83%). This, however, is expected since most
common emoticons and interjections with prior po-
larities are already covered in the total score of the
expression. Thus, the noisy data based binary fea-
tures have significant contribution only when the
emoticons and interjections aren?t present in the lex-
icon. This implies that these binary features only

hint towards the expression being subjective. The
context features, i.e., phrase prior polarity and POS
tag pattern features defined for 2 words before and
after the expression also carry more significance dur-
ing subjectivity classification than in sentiment po-
larity classification.
Polarity Classification comparison for Twitter
and SMS expression data For the second set of
experiments comparing the performance of polarity
classification in Twitter expressions and SMS ex-
pressions, we use the polarity classification model
learnt in the above experiment. Tables 2(a) and 2(b)
shows the precision, recall and F-measure scores for
both Twitter and SMS expressions.
The polarity classification accuracies for Twitter
and SMS expressions are 74.76% and 70.82%, re-
spectively. Closer inspection of test data shows that
SMS expressions exhibit more aggressive usage of
abbreviations and slangs and are in general noisier
than Twitter expressions. This is probably due to the
fact that typing on a cellphone is more cumbersome
than on a keyboard. The quantitative distribution of
positive, negative and neutral classes in both datasets
affects the F-measure scores of individual classes.
This is evident from the difference in positive and
negative F-measures of Twitter and SMS expres-
sions data. In both datasets, neutral class F-measure
is extremely low. This is partially expected due to
the low quantity of neutral class expressions in Twit-
ter (160/4435) and SMS (159/2334) data. Still, it

seems that more fine-grained analysis of neutral ex-
pressions is required for better polarity classification
accuracy.
Our method ranks 16th (F-measure: 0.7441) out
of 28 participating systems for Twitter data and 12th
(F-measure: 0.7348) out of 26 participating systems
for SMS data. The best performing system have
0.8893(NRC-Canada) and 0.8837(GUMLTLT) av-
eraged(positive, negative) F-measure score for Twit-
ter and SMS data, respectively.
5 Conclusions
Our experiments on features show that phrase prior
polarity features give good results for both subjec-
tivity and polarity classification. POS tag pattern
features, emoticon and interjection features, on the
other hand, are better suited for subjectivity classi-
fication. A deeper analysis is required and various
relational and dependency features should be iden-
tified and used to improve the performance of po-
larity classification. SMS expressions are noisier in
general than Twitter expressions and thus the polar-
ity classifier gives less accurate results for it. How-
ever, both of these datasets face problems common
to the polarity classifier. More research is needed
with a balanced dataset to understand various under-
lying relational causes for an expression to become
neutral and to further confirm the conclusions of this
paper.
