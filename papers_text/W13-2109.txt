Abstract
Pointing gestures are pervasive in human
referring actions, and are often combined
with spoken descriptions. Combining ges-
ture and speech naturally to refer to objects
is an essential task in multimodal NLG
systems. However, the way gesture and
speech should be combined in a referring
act remains an open question. In particu-
lar, it is not clear whether, in planning a
pointing gesture in conjunction with a de-
scription, an NLG system should seek to
minimise the redundancy between them,
e.g. by letting the pointing gesture indi-
cate locative information, with other, non-
locative properties of a referent included
in the description. This question has a
bearing on whether the gestural and spo-
ken parts of referring acts are planned sep-
arately or arise from a common underly-
ing computational mechanism. This paper
investigates this question empirically, us-
ing machine-learning techniques on a new
corpus of dialogues involving multimodal
references to objects. Our results indi-
cate that human pointing strategies inter-
act with descriptive strategies. In partic-
ular, pointing gestures are strongly asso-
ciated with the use of locative features in
referring expressions.
1 Introduction
Referring Expression Generation (REG) is consid-
ered a core task in many NLG systems (Krahmer
and van Deemter, 2012). Typically, the REG task is
defined in terms of identification: a referent needs
to be unambiguously identified in a discourse, en-
abling the reader or listener to pick it out from
among its potential distractors. Most work in this
area has focused on algorithms that select the con-
tent for definite descriptions (Dale, 1989; Dale and
Reiter, 1995), or on the best form for a referring
expression given the discourse context, for exam-
ple, whether it should be a full definite description,
a reduced one, or a pronoun (McCoy and Strube,
1999; Callaway and Lester, 2002; Krahmer and
Theune, 2002).
Less attention has been payed to the role of
gestures in referring actions and the way these
can be coupled with discursive strategies for ref-
erent identification. This question becomes partic-
ularly important in the context of multimodal sys-
tems, for example, those involving embodied con-
versational agents, where the ?naturalness? of an
interaction hinges in part on the appropriate use
of embodied actions, including referring actions.
Multimodal strategies can also make communica-
tion more efficient. For example, Louwerse and
Bangerter (2010) found that the use of pointing
gestures resulted in significantly faster resolution
of ambiguous referring expressions; crucially, this
result was replicated when the pointing gesture
was artificially generated, rather than made by a
human.
Like human communicators, embodied agents
need the ability to plan multimodal referring acts,
combining both linguistic reference and pointing.
An important question is whether these two com-
ponents of a referring act should be planned in or-
der to minimise redundancy between them or not.
For example, given that a pointing gesture can ef-
ficiently locate a target referent in a visual do-
main, should an accompanying description avoid
mentioning locative properties, thereby minimis-
ing redundancy? This question is the main focus
of this paper. However, it bears on a deeper is-
sue, of relevance to the architecture of multimodal
systems (and the cognitive architectures whose be-
haviours such systems seek to emulate): Should
gestural and descriptive strategies be viewed as
separate (implying that a REG module can plan
its linguistic referring expressions more or less in-
82
dependently of whether a pointing gesture is also
used) or should they be viewed as tightly coupled?
If they are indeed coupled, are there any features
of a linguistic description (for example, an object?s
location) which are excluded when a pointing ges-
ture is used, or are linguistic features always re-
dundant with pointing?
The present paper addresses these questions in a
data-driven fashion, using a multimodal corpus of
dialogues collected specifically to study referring
actions at both the linguistic and gestural levels.
We focus on pointing (that is, deictic) gestures di-
rected at an intended referent (as opposed to, say,
iconic gestures) and investigate the extent to which
pointing interacts with linguistic means for refer-
ent identification. Following an overview of pre-
vious work on pointing and reference (Section 2)
and a description of the corpus (Section 3), we de-
scribe a number of machine-learning experiments
that address the main empirical question (Section
4), concluding with a discussion.
2 Background: Pointing and describing
There is a growing consensus in the psycholin-
guistic literature, especially following the work
of McNeill (McNeill, 1985), that gesture and
language share a number of underlying mental
processes and are therefore coupled to a signif-
icant degree. This view is in part based on the
observation that gestures are temporally coupled
with speech and contribute meaningfully to the
achievement of a communicative intention (Mc-
Neill and Duncan, 2000). For instance, in the ex-
ample below, extracted from our corpus (see Sec-
tion 3), a speaker identifies a landmark (composed
of a collection of five circles) on a map through a
combination of a pointing gesture and the mention
of the size and colour of the elements making up
the landmark.
(1) there?s a group of five large red ones [points]
In this case, the pointing gesture further con-
tributes to the communicative aim of identifying
the cluster of five objects, in tandem with the vi-
sual features mentioned in the description. Mc-
Neill?s proposal (McNeill and Duncan, 2000) is
that speech and gesture should be considered as
the joint outcome of the language production pro-
cess, rather than as outcomes of separate pro-
cesses. Various models have been proposed which
are more or less congruent with this view. For
example, de Ruiter (2000) proposes that the two
modalities are planned together at early stages of
conceptualisation during speech production, while
Kita and O?zyu?rek (2003) suggest that gestures are
planned by spatio-motoric processes which differ
from the planning of speech production, but inter-
act with it at particular points.
Recent computational work has also taken these
ideas on board. For example, Kopp et. al. (2008)
describe a system for the concurrent planning and
generation of gesture and speech, whose archi-
tecture is inspired by Kita and O?zyu?rek (2003)
and which makes use of ?multimodal concepts?
(inspired by McNeill?s ?growth points?) combin-
ing both propositional and visuo-spatial proper-
ties. This contrasts with earlier architectures, such
as that proposed by Andre? and Rist (1996), where
generation of text and gesture is undertaken by
separate modules communicating with a central
planner.
The idea that the planning of language is tightly
coupled with that of gesture raises the possibility
that the two modalities may overlap to different
degrees. Gesture may be completely redundant
with speech, or may encode aspects of the com-
municative intention that are not included in the
linguistic message itself. This raises an interesting
question for multimodal REG: are there features of
objects that tend to be mentioned in tandem with
a pointing gesture; if so, which are they? For ex-
ample, the reference in (1) mentions the size and
colour of the landmark, but not its location, pos-
sibly suggesting that the speaker relied on point-
ing to convey the ?where? of the target referent, as
opposed to the ?what?, which is conveyed by the
description. This, however, is not the case in the
example below, where pointing is accompanied by
a mention of the referent?s location.

[points]
There are at least two views on the relationship
between pointing and describing (de Ruiter et al,
2012). On the one hand, the trade-off hypothesis
holds that the decision to use a pointing gesture de-
pends on the effort or ?cost? involved (the further
away from the speaker and the smaller a referent
is, the more costly it would be to point at it), com-
pared to the effort involved in describing a referent
linguistically.
On the other hand, pointing and (some aspects
of) describing might proceed hand in hand, so that
83
there is some degree of redundancy between the
two modalities. Under this view, pointing may be
chosen not based on (low) cost assessment but as
part of a specifically multimodal cognitive strat-
egy.
Evidence for the trade-off hypothesis is reported
by Bangerter (2004), who found that, as pointing
became easier in a task-oriented dialogue (because
the distance between the speaker and the referent
was shorter), there was a decrease in verbal effort,
as measured by the number of words produced, as
well as a decrease in the use of locative and visual
features such as colour. Piwek (2007) also found
that referring acts accompanied by pointing tended
to include descriptions containing fewer properties
than those which were not. These results are com-
patible with a view of the speaker/generator as es-
sentially seeking to minimise effort in the commu-
nicative act, adopting the easiest available strategy
that will not compromise communicative success
(Beun and Cremers, 1998).
Similar results are reported by van der Sluis and
Krahmer (2007), who model the trade-off hypoth-
esis in a multimodal REG algorithm based on the
graph-based framework of Krahmer et. al. (2003).
The algorithm chooses to use pointing gestures,
with various degrees of precision, depending on
their cost relative to that of features that can be
used in a linguistic description.
There is also evidence against the trade-off
model. Recent experimental work by de Ruiter
et. al. (2012) showed that the tendency for speak-
ers to point was unaffected by the difficulty of re-
ferring to an object using linguistic features, al-
though pointing did decrease with repeated refer-
ence to the same entities. Interestingly, the authors
observed a correlation between the rate of pointing
and the use of locative properties of objects. This
would appear to favour a model in which the lin-
guistically describable features of objects are dif-
ferentiated: speakers may be using locative prop-
erties and pointing together as part of a strategy to
identify the ?where? of an object. This is in line
with the observation by Louwerse and Bangerter
(2010) that, in visual domains, using pointing ges-
tures with locative expressions increases the speed
with which references are resolved.
The evidence from de Ruiter et. al would seem
to contradict the assumptions underlying current
multimodal REG models. As we have seen, van der
Sluis and Krahmer (van der Sluis and Krahmer,
2007) assume a trade-off between speech and ges-
ture. A similar assumption is made by Kranstedt
and Wachsmuth (2005), who view pointing ges-
turs as mainly concerned with the ?where? of an
object. Their algorithm, which underlies the plan-
ning of multimodal references by a virtual agent,
extends the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Re-
iter, 1995) as follows. Given an object in a 3D
space, the algorithm first considers the possibil-
ity of producing an unambiguous pointing ges-
ture; failing this, a pointing gesture covering the
intended referent and some of its surrounding dis-
tractors may be planned. In the latter case, the al-
gorithm then integrates other features of the ob-
ject (e.g. its colour), in an effort to exclude the
distractors that remain within the scope of the am-
biguous point. One of the claims underlying this
model is that ?absolute? location, which is covered
by pointing, is given first preference after pointing
itself, with other features of a referent being con-
sidered afterwards, in a preference order that will
only use relative location if all other options (such
as colour) are exhausted.
In summary, the empirical evidence for the
relationship between pointing and describing is
mixed. While the view that the planning of lan-
guage in different modalities should be tightly
coupled has proven useful and productive, the pre-
cise way in which the two interact in a referring act
is still an open question, especially where the re-
lationship between location and the other features
of a target referent is concerned. In the remain-
der of this paper, we report on an empirical study
that used machine learning methods with a view to
establishing the relationship between descriptive
features and pointing in multimodal references.
Our study is not committed to a specific architec-
ture for multimodal reference planning; rather, our
aim is to establish whether pointing and describ-
ing can partly overlap in the information that they
convey about a referent. Specifically, we are in-
terested in whether the use of a description that
includes spatial or locative information excludes a
pointing gesture.

logues elicited using a task similar to the Map-
Task (Anderson et al, 1991), in which a director
and a follower talked about a map displayed on a
wall in front of them, approximately 1 metre away.
Each also had a private copy of the map; the di-
rector?s map had an itinerary on it, and her task
was to communicate the itinerary to the follower,
who marked it on his own private map. Partici-
pants were free to interact using speech and ges-
ture, without touching the shared map or standing
up. They could see each other, but could not see
each other?s private maps. Figure 1(a) displays the
basic experimental setup.
The maps consisted of shapes (squares or cir-
cles), with a sequence of landmarks constituting
the itinerary (initially known only to the director).
The maps were designed to manipulate a number
of independent variables, in a balanced design:
? Cardinality The target destinations in the
itineraries were either individual landmarks
(in 2 of the maps) or sets of 5 landmarks with
the same attributes (e.g., all green squares);
? Visual Attributes: Targets on the itinerary
differed from their distractors ? the objects
in their immediate vicinity (the focus area)
? in colour, or in size, or in both colour and
size. The focus area was defined as the set of
objects immediately surrounding a target;
? Prior reference: Some of the targets were
visited twice in the itinerary;
? Shift of domain focus: Targets were located
near to or far away from the previous target.
Note that if two targets t1 and t2 were in the
near condition, then t1 is one of the distrac-
tors of t2 and vice versa.
Each participant dyad did all four maps (single-
ton squares and circles; group squares and circles),
85
in a pseudo-random order, alternating in the di-
rector/matcher role so that each was director for
two of the maps. Figure 1(b) displays the direc-
tor?s map consisting of group circles. Note that the
itinerary is marked by numbering the target land-
marks. Landmarks with two numbers are visited
twice (for example, the first landmark is marked
1, but is also marked 5, meaning that it is the first
and the fifth landmark in the itinerary). During the
experiment, the map was mounted on a wall and
blown up to A0 size; this significantly reduced the
impression of visual clutter.
Data was collected from 8 pairs of participants3.
In the present study, we focus exclusively on the
directors? utterances. These were transcribed and
split up according to the landmark to which they
corresponded. In case a landmark was described
over multiple turns in the dialogue, each turn was
annotated as a separate utterance. Utterances were
annotated with the features displayed in Table 1.
Broadly, features are divided into four types: (a)
Deictic/Anaphoric, pertaining to the use of de-
ictic demonstratives, and/or references to previ-
ously identified entities; (ii) Visual, that is, cor-
responding to a landmark?s perceptual properties;
(iii) Locative, involving a description of the ob-
ject?s location; and (iv) Action, pertaining to ges-
ture and gaze. All features are frequencies per
utterance, except for Action features, which are
boolean.

tures relative to different object types.
As expected, linguistic features are much more
frequent than pointing gestures. In fact only
16.4% of the utterances in the corpus are accompa-
nied by pointing gestures. Previous studies, such
as that by Beun and Cremers (Beun and Cremers,
1998) report a higher incidence of pointing (48%
overall). Note, however, that Beun and Cremers
focussed exclusively on first mention descriptions
(which numbered 145 in all), while our corpus in-
cludes subsequent mentions, as well as multiple
consecutive references to the same object divided
over several utterances (which are counted sepa-
rately in our totals).
Table 3 shows frequency figures for the pointing
gestures in the corpus relative to the type of object
they refer to (group vs. singleton): in accordance
with the trade-off theory, which predicts that larger
objects should be easier to point at, we see a sig-
nificant difference (?2(1) = 4.769, p = 0.028)
between the two types, with more pointing occur-
ring with group objects (that is, in group maps).
4 Experiments
In much of the work discussed in Section 2, the
generation of pointing gestures is viewed as de-
pendent on physical characteristics of the refer-
ents, in other words on their being suitable for
pointing. This is especially true of work related
to the trade-off hypothesis, in which the costs of
pointing gestures are calculated as a function of
the referent object?s size and its distance from the
speaker. In the present paper, by contrast, we
are interested in investigating the relation between
pointing and linguistic means of referent identi-
fication. More specifically, we address the ques-
tion to what degree the different linguistic expres-
sions used by the speaker to refer to objects in
86
the MREDI dialogues, can be used to predict the
occurrence of pointing gestures. Note that this
question addresses the correlation between prop-
erties in a description and the occurrence of point-
ing, rather than the issue of how pointing and de-
scribing should be planned. Nevertheless, as we
have emphasised in Section 2, the question of co-
occurrence of the two referential strategies does
have a bearing on architectural issues.
A first set of experiments were run in order to
test the general trade-off hypothesis. We tested
a number of classifiers on the task of classifying
the binary feature point, given all the linguistic
features in the corpus. More specifically, the at-
tributes used for the classification were MapConfl,
DIR, RP, AP, FP, S, Sh, C, D, I, Point. They are
all explained and exemplified in Table 1 with the
exception of MapConfl, which indicates whether a
specific case in the data comes from a group or a
singleton map. This feature was included because,
as noted in the previous section, whether a target
landmark was a singleton or a group made a dif-
ference, presumably because groups are larger and
more visually salient. Note further that one of the
Action features, GZ (gaze), is ignored in the ex-
periments because it is an almost univocal predic-
tor of pointing. Indeed, gazing is involved roughly
every time Point has the value y (yes) (but not the
other way round).
The experiments were run using the Weka (Wit-
ten and Frank, 2005) tool, which gives access
to many different algorithms, and 10-fold cross-
validation was used throughout. The results are
shown in Table (4) in terms of Precision, Recall
and F-measure for each of the classifiers.

Table 4: Predicting pointing gestures given all the
linguistic features in the corpus: classification re-
sults.
Two baselines were created to evaluate the re-
sults. The first one is provided by the ZeroR clas-
sifier, which always chooses the most frequent
class, in this case n (no pointing gesture). The
F-measure obtained by this method is somewhat
high at 0.761, because there are relatively few
pointing gestures in the data. The second base-
line, which provides a slightly more interesting re-
sult against which to evaluate the other classifiers,
is provided by OneR. It achieves an F-measure of
0.765 by predicting a pointing gesture if DIR >=
2.5, in other words if there are at least 2.5 occur-
rences of direction expressions in the utterance.
Using this rule has the effect of predicting a few
of the pointing gestures, with an F-measure on the
y class (occurrence of pointing gestures) of 0.031.
The other four sets of results were obtained
by running four different classification algorithms
with the same set of attributes. Apart from SMO
(an algorithm using support vector machines), all
the classifiers perform better than the baseline.
The best results are produced by the decision tree
classifier J48, which obtains an overall F-measure
of 0.833, and an F-measure of 0.421 on the y class.
The confusion matrix generated by J48 on this
data-set is shown in Table (5)

1794 91 a = n

Table 5: Predicting pointing given all the linguistic
features in the corpus: confusion matrix.
The model created by the decision tree classi-
fier (J48) is quite complex (size=57 and no. of
leaves=29). The first branching, which corre-
sponds to no AP (Absolute Position) and no C
(Colour), assigns n to as many as 1571 instances
(with 115 errors). The tree is shown in Fig-
ure (2). The tree also shows that certain combina-
tions of features are more likely to be associated
with pointing gestures. These are predominantly
combinations including occurrences of AP, or, in
the absence of absolute position, combinations in-
cluding positive values for FP (Frequency of ref-
erence on Path) and DIR (Direction).
The maximum entropy model, built by the lo-
gistic regression algorithm (Logistic), shows sim-
ilar tendencies in that the attributes that are as-
signed the highest weights are AP, C and DIR.
These results confirm the general hypothesis
that there is a strong relationship between linguis-
tic features used in a description and pointing ges-
tures. Indeed, it is possible to predict pointing ges-
tures on the basis of the linguistic features used.

Table 6: Predicting pointing gestures with different feature combinations: classification results.
In particular, the results suggest a difference be-
tween features that express locative properties and
those having to do with the visual description of
the same object (its colour, size and shape). More
specifically, it would seem that locative features
are more useful to the classifiers than visual prop-
erties.
To test this second hypothesis, we ran a series
of experiments where the task was still to predict
pointing gestures, but different subsets of the lin-
guistic features were tested one at the time. For
each feature combination, we run the classification
using J48, Naive Bayes and the Logistic regression
algorithm. In Table (6), we show the best result
obtained for each feature combination. The classi-
fiers are ordered from the most accurate to the least
accurate, and the combination of features used by
each of them is listed in the last column. The best
results and the two baselines from the previous set
of experiments are included for the sake of com-
parison. Note that the term Loc is used to refer to
all the locative attributes AP, DIR, RP, AP and FP,
88
while Visual refers to S, Sh and C.
The best results are those obtained when the
complete feature set is used in the training. How-
ever, the next best results are achieved by the clas-
sifiers using the locative features, either alone or
together with features concerning the map type,
identity with a previously mentioned object and
deictic reference, with an F-measure in the range
0.802?0.808. If visual features are used instead,
the F-measure is in the range 0.775?0.779. The
worst results are obtained if neither location nor
visual description are used. Thus, although the dif-
ferences between the best and the worst classifiers
are not dramatic, in this data we see a tendency for
the locative features to be slightly better predictors
of pointing gestures than features corresponding to
visual descriptions.
5 Discussion and conclusions
The automatic classification experiments de-
scribed above show that to a certain extent, the
pointing gestures occurring in the MREDI corpus
can be predicted based on the linguistic expres-
sions used by the speaker in conjunction with
pointing. More precisely, linguistic descriptions
can be used to predict about one third of the point-
ing gestures that speakers have produced in the
corpus. This is an interesting and novel result,
which not only supports the general notion that
gestures and speech should be seen as tightly cou-
pled, but also suggests that this coupling does not
result in a minimisation of redundancy between
the two modalities. Rather, it appears that a num-
ber of pointing gestures accompanied descriptions
containing locative properties, something that con-
tradicts the predictions of models based on the
trade-off hypothesis (Kranstedt and Wachsmuth,
2005; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2007).
There are a number of limitations of the present
study, which we plan to address in future work.
First, pointing gestures in our corpus were rela-
tively scarce (16.4% of utterances were accompa-
nied by pointing). This in part explains the relative
accuracy of our baselines: predicting the major-
ity class (that is, no pointing) in every case will
clearly yield reasonable results given that the size
of the class is so large. On the other hand, the
relative scarcity of pointing may also indicate that
pointing is somewhat more costly than linguistic
description, in cognitive and physical terms. In
fact, the difference we see in the number of point-
ing gestures between singleton and group maps
also seems to confirm this assumption: in the
group maps, where objects are larger, and thus
more easily pointed at according to the trade-off
model, there are in fact significantly more pointing
gestures. The incidence of pointing may also have
been affected by the nature of the domains used:
although the shared maps in the experiments were
large and quite close to the interlocutors, the pres-
ence of objects of the same shape may have added
to the general visual clutter of the maps, making
pointing less likely.
Another aspect of the data that we have not
investigated is the presence of individual strate-
gies. We know that speakers differ a lot in their
use of gesturing as regards e.g. frequency, type
of gesture and representation techniques. Recent
models of gesture production for embodied agents
are taking such differences into account (Neff et
al., 2008; Bergmann and Kopp, 2009). Similarly,
some speakers might have a greater preference for
pointing than others. For example, Beun and Cre-
mers (1998) note that certain speakers in their cor-
pus explicitly stated that they had attempted to per-
form the task in their dialogues without pointing,
in spite of their having been told that they could
point. Recent data-driven experiments on referen-
tial descriptions by Dale and Viethen (Dale and Vi-
ethen, 2010), In a domain quite similar to the one
used here, suggest that speakers do indeed clus-
ter according to their preferred referential strat-
egy. Similar assumptions have informed REG al-
gorithms trained on the TUNA Corpus, in the con-
text of the Generation Challenges (Gatt and Belz,
2010) (Bohnet, 2008; Di Fabbrizio et al, 2008).
In future work, we plan to address this question
in a multimodal context, where results by Piwek
(2007) have already suggested that such individ-
ual strategies may play an important role.
The hypothesis that specific combinations of
pointing and linguistic descriptions (for example,
an object?s colour or size) can be excluded, is
clearly not borne out by the data. There is, how-
ever, a tendency for locative features to act as
stronger predictors of pointing gestures. Although
the trend is not very strong, it is an interesting
one since it confirms the experimental results by
de Ruiter et. al. reviewed earlier (de Ruiter et al,
2012). This may suggest that a pointing gesture
may ultimately be planned within the same system
as locative features (i.e. the decision of whether or
89
not to point is not dependent on the decision of
whether or not to describe inherent, visual proper-
ties of the object, but on whether the object?s lo-
cation is to be indicated). Another feature that is
worth exploring further is deixis, specifically the
difference between proximal and distal deictic ex-
pressions and their interaction with pointing ges-
tures. For example, Piwek et al (2007) found that
proximal deictic expressions tend to be associated
with a more intensive attentional focusing mecha-
nism, while Bangerter (2004) also observes an as-
sociation between pointing and the use of deictic
expressions.
From an NLG perspective, our results suggest
that decisions to generate a pointing gesture and
those to select visual attributes might take place
independently (perhaps in parallel, perhaps in dif-
ferent modules). From a cognitive perspective, it
suggests two types of interaction between atten-
tion/vision and language/gesture, related to the de-
scription of the ?what? of an object and its ?where?
(Landau and Jackendoff, 1993).
Finally, our study focused on the relationship
between the two modalities involved in a referen-
tial act, addressing the question of redundancy be-
tween them. We have not addressed the impact of
the visual properties of a target referent in relation
to its surrounding objects, on the choices speakers
make in these two modalities. This is a priority for
future work, given that the corpus was designed to
balance the presence or absence of various visual
properties of an object (see Section 3). Taking this
even further, it remains to be investigated, for ex-
ample, whether there would be interesting differ-
ences in the relationship betwene pointing and de-
scribing between 2D scenes of the kind used here,
and 3D environments of the sort used by Kranst-
edt and Wachsmuth (2005). Another priority is
to take into account the interactive nature of the
dialogues, with particular focus on the follower?s
feedback to the director, as an indicator of the suc-
cess of referential expressions. This is another as-
pect of the dialogue situation that may have an im-
pact on planning multimodal referential acts.
