Abstract
We present an approach for generation of mor-
phologically rich languages using statistical
machine translation. Given a sequence of lem-
mas and any subset of morphological features,
we produce the inflected word forms. Testing
on Arabic, a morphologically rich language,
our models can reach 92.1% accuracy starting
only with lemmas, and 98.9% accuracy if all
the gold features are provided.
1 Introduction
Many natural language processing (NLP) applica-
tions, such as summarization and machine trans-
lation (MT), require natural language generation
(NLG). Generation for morphologically rich lan-
guages, which introduce a lot of challenges for NLP
in general, has gained a lot of attention recently, es-
pecially in the context of statistical MT (SMT). The
common wisdom for handling morphological rich-
ness is to reduce the complexity in the internal ap-
plication models and then generate complex word
forms in a final step.
In this paper,1 we present a SMT-based approach
for generation of morphologically rich languages.
Given a sequence of lemmas and any subset of mor-
phological features, we produce the inflected word
forms. The SMT model parameters are derived from
a parallel corpus mapping lemmas and morphologi-
cal features to the inflected word forms.
As a case study, we focus on Arabic, a mor-
phologically rich language. Our models can reach
92.1% accuracy starting only with tokenized lem-
mas and predicting some features, up from 55.0%
accuracy without inflecting the lemmas. If all of the
gold morphological features are provided as input,
our best model achieves 98.9% accuracy.

2 Related Work
In the context of morphological generation for MT,
the state-of-the-art factored machine translation ap-
proach models morphology using generation factors
in the translation process (Koehn et al, 2007). One
of the limitations of factored models is that gen-
eration is based on the word level not the phrase
level and the context is only captured through a lan-
guage model. Minkov et al (2007) and Toutanova et
al. (2008) model translation and morphology inde-
pendently for English-Arabic and English-Russian
MT. They use a maximum entropy model to predict
inflected word forms directly. Clifton and Sarkar
(2011) use a similar approach for English-Finnish
MT where they predict morpheme sequences. Un-
like both approaches, we generate the word forms
from the deeper representation of lemmas and fea-
tures.
As for using SMT in generation, there are many
previous efforts. Wong and Mooney (2007) use
SMT methods for tactical NLG. They learn through
SMT to map meaning representations to natural lan-
guage. Quirk et al (2004) apply SMT tools to gen-
erate paraphrases of input sentences in the same lan-
guage. Both of these efforts target English, a mor-
phologically poor language. Our work is conceptu-
ally closer to Wong and Mooney (2007), except that
we focus on the question of morphological genera-
tion and our approach includes an optional feature
prediction component. In a related publication, we
integrate our generation model as part of end-to-end
English-Arabic SMT (El Kholy and Habash, 2012).
In that work, we make use of English features in the
Arabic morphology prediction component, e.g., En-
glish POS and parse trees.

3 Arabic Challenges
Arabic is a morphologically complex language. One
aspect of Arabic?s complexity is its orthography
which often omits short vowel diacritics. As a re-
sult, ambiguity is rampant. Another aspect is the
various attachable clitics which include conjunction
proclitics, e.g., +? w+ ?and?, particle proclitics, e.g.,
+? l+ ?to/for?, the definite article +?@ Al+ ?the?, and
the class of pronominal enclitics, e.g., ??+ +hm
?their/them?. Beyond these clitics, Arabic words
inflect for person (PER), gender (GEN), number
(NUM), aspect (ASP), mood (MOD), voice (VOX),
state (STT) and case (CAS). Arabic inflectional
features are realized as affixes as well as templatic
changes, e.g., broken plurals.2
These three phenomena, optional diacritics, at-
tachable clitics and the large inflectional space, lead
to thousands of inflected forms per lemma and a high
degree of ambiguity: about 12 analyses per word,
typically corresponding to two lemmas on average
(Habash, 2010). The Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)
tokenization scheme (Maamouri et al, 2004), which
we use in all our experiments, separates all clitics
except for the determiner clitic Al+ (DET). As such
we consider the DET as an additional morphological
feature.
Arabic has complex morpho-syntactic agreement
rules in terms of GEN, NUM and definiteness. Ad-
jectives agree with nouns in GEN and NUM but plu-
ral irrational nouns exceptionally take feminine sin-
gular adjectives. Moreover, verbs agree with sub-
jects in GEN only in VSO order while they agree
in GEN and NUM in SVO order (Alkuhlani and
Habash, 2011). The DET in Arabic is used to dis-
tinguish different syntactic constructions such as the
possessive or adjectival modification. These agree-
ment rules make the generation of correctly inflected
forms in context a challenging task.
4 Approach
In this section, we discuss our approach in gener-
ating Arabic words from Arabic lemmas (LEMMA)
using a pipeline of three steps.
1. (Optional)Morphology Prediction of linguis-
tic features to inflect LEMMAs.
2The Arabic NLP tools we use in this paper do not model all
templatic inflectional realizations.

2. Morphology Generation of inflected Arabic
tokens from LEMMAs and any subset of Ara-
bic linguistic features.
3. Detokenization of inflected Arabic tokens into
surface Arabic words.
Morphology generation is the main contribution
of this paper which in addition to detokenization rep-
resents an end-to-end inflection generator. The mor-
phology prediction step is an optional step that com-
plements the whole process by enriching the input
of the morphology generation step with one or more
predicted morphological features.
We follow numerous previously published efforts
on the value of tokenization for Arabic NLP tasks
(Badr et al, 2008; El Kholy and Habash, 2010). We
use the best performing tokenization scheme (PATB)
in machine translation in all our experiments and fo-
cus on the question of how to generate Arabic in-
flected words from LEMMAs and features. Figure 1
shows an example of a tokenized word and its de-
composition into a LEMMA and morphological fea-
tures.
Morphology Prediction This optional step takes
a sequence of LEMMAs and tries to enrich them
by predicting one or more morphological features.
It is implemented using a supervised discriminative
learning model, namely Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) (Lafferty et al, 2001). Table 1 shows the
accuracy of the CRF module on a test set of 1000
sentences compared to using the most common fea-
ture value baseline. Some features, such as CAS and
STT are harder to predict but they also have very low
baseline values. GEN, DET and NUM have a mod-
erate prediction accuracy while ASP, PER, VOX and
MOD have high prediction accuracy (but also very
high baselines). This task is similar to POS tagging

except that it starts with lemmas as opposed to in-
flected forms (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Alkuh-
lani and Habash, 2012). As such, we expect it to
perform worse than a comparable POS tagging task.
For example, Habash and Rambow (2005) report
98.2% and 98.8% for GEN and NUM, respectively,
compared to our 84.2% and 87.3%.
In the context of a specific application, the per-
formance of the prediction could be improved us-
ing information other than the context of provided
LEMMAs. For example, in MT, source language lex-
ical, syntactic and morphological information could
be used in the prediction module (El Kholy and
Habash, 2012).
The morphology prediction step produces a lat-
tice with all the possible feature values each having
an associated confidence score. We filter out options
with very low confidence scores to control the expo-
nential size of the lattice when combining more than
one feature. We tried some experiments using only
one or two top values but got lower performance.
The morphology generation step takes the lattice and
decides on the best target inflection.
Morphology Generation This step is imple-
mented using a SMT model that translates from a
deeper linguistic representation to a surface repre-
sentation. The model parameters are derived from a
parallel corpus mapping LEMMAs plus morphologi-
cal features to Arabic inflected forms. The model is
monotonic and there is neither reordering nor word
deletion/addition. We plan to consider these varia-
tions in the future. The main advantage of this ap-
proach is that it only needs monolingual data which
is abundant.
The morphology generation step can take a se-
quence of LEMMAs and a subset of morphological
features directly or after enriching the sequence with
one or more morphological features using the mor-
phology prediction step.
Detokenization Since we work on tokenized Ara-
bic, we use a detokenization step which simply
stitches the words and clitics together as a post-
processing step after morphology generation. We
use the best detokenization technique presented by
El Kholy and Habash (2010).
5 Evaluation
Evaluation Setup All of the training data we use
is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC).3 For SMT training and language modeling
(LM), we use 200M words from the Arabic Giga-
word corpus (LDC2007T40). We use 5-grams for
all LMs implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002).
MADA+TOKAN (Habash and Rambow, 2005;
Habash et al, 2009) is used to preprocess the
Arabic text for generation and language modeling.
MADA+TOKAN tokenizes, lemmatizes and selects
all morphological features in context.
All generation experiments are conducted using
the Moses phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al,
2007). The decoding weight optimization is done
using a set of 300 Arabic sentences from the 2004
NIST MT evaluation test set (MT04). The tuning is
based on tokenized Arabic without detokenization.
We use a maximum phrase length of size 4. We
report results on the Arabic side of the 2005 NIST
MT evaluation set (MT05), our development set.
We use the Arabic side of MT06 NIST data set for
blind test. We evaluate using BLEU-1 and BLEU-4
(Papineni et al, 2002). BLEU is a precision-based
evaluation metric commonly used in MT research.
Given the way we define our generation task to ex-
clude reordering and word deletion/addition, BLEU-
1 can be interpreted as a measure of word accuracy.
BLEU-4 is the geometric mean of unigram, bigram,
trigram and 4-gram precision.4 Since Arabic text

that appear in the reference divided by the number of all possi-
ble n-word sequences in the test.

is generally written without diacritics, we evaluate
on undiacritized text only. In the future, we plan
to study generation into diacritized Arabic, a more
challenging goal.
Baseline We conducted two baseline experiments.
First, as a degenerate baseline, we only used deto-
kenization to generate the inflected words from
LEMMAs. Second, we used a generation step be-
fore detokenization to generate the inflected tokens
from LEMMAs. The BLEU-1/BLEU-4 scores of
the two baselines on the MT05 set are 55.04/24.51
and 91.54/82.19. We get a significant improvement
(?35% BLEU-1 & ?58% BLEU-4) by using the
generation step before detokenization.
Generation with Gold Features We built several
SMT systems translating from LEMMAs plus one or
more morphological features to Arabic inflected to-
kens. We then use the detokenization step to recom-
bine the tokens and produce the surface words.
Table 2 shows the BLEU scores for MT05 set as
LEMMAs plus different morphological features and
their combinations. We greedily combined the fea-
tures based on the performance of each feature sep-
arately. Features with higher performance are com-
bined first. As expected, the more features are in-
cluded the better the results. Oddly, when we add
the POS to the feature combination, the performance
drops. That could be explained by the redundancy in
information provided by the POS given all the other
features and the added sparsity.
Although STT and MOD features hurt the per-
formance when added incrementally to the feature
combination, removing them from the complete fea-
ture set led to a drop in performance. We suspect
that there are synergies in combining different fea-
tures. We plan to investigate this point extensively
in the future. BLEU scores are very high because
the input is golden in terms of word order, lemma
choice and features. These scores should be seen as
the upper limit of our model?s performance. Most of
the errors are detokenization and word form under-
specification errors.
Generation with Predicted Features We com-
pare results of generation with a variety of predicted
features (see Table 3). The results show that us-
ing predicted features can help improve the gener-
ation quality over the baseline in some cases, e.g.,

when the LEMMAs are enriched with CAS, ASP,
PER, VOX or MOD features. Our best performer is
LEMMA+MOD. Unlike gold features, greedily com-
bining predicted features hurts the performance and
the more features added the worse the performance.
One explanation is that each feature is predicted in-
dependently which may lead to incompatible feature
values. In the future, we plan to investigate ways
of combining features that could help performance
such predicting more than one feature together and
filtering out bad feature combinations. The feature
prediction accuracy (Table 1) does not always cor-
relate with the generation performance, e.g., CAS
has lower accuracy than GEN, but has a relatively
higher BLEU score. This may be due to the fact that
some features are mostly realized as diacritics (CAS)
which are ignored in our evaluation.
Blind Test Set To validate our results, we ap-
plied different versions of our system to a blind
test set (MT06). Our results are as follows
(BLEU-1/BLEU-4): detokenization without inflec-
tion (55.64/24.92), generation from LEMMAs only
(86.70/72.69), generation with gold MOD feature
(87.00/73.31), and generation with predicted MOD
feature (86.96/73.29). These numbers are generally

conclusions are consistent.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We present a SMT-based approach to generation of
morphologically rich languages. We evaluate our
approach under a variety of settings for Arabic. In
the future, we plan to improve the quality of feature
prediction and test our approach on other languages.
