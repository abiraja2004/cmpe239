Abstract 
This paper presents factors in designing a sys-
tem for automatically skimming text docu-
ments in response to a question. The system 
will take a potentially complex question and a 
single document and return a Web page con-
taining links to text related to the question. 
The goal is that these text areas be those that 
visual readers would spend the most time on 
when skimming for the answer to a question. 
To identify these areas, we had visual readers 
skim for an answer to a complex question 
while being tracked by an eye-tracking sys-
tem. Analysis of these results indicates that 
text with semantic connections to the question 
are of interest, but these connections are much 
looser than can be identified with traditional 
Question-Answering or Information Retrieval 
techniques. Instead, we are expanding tradi-
tional semantic treatments by using a Web 
search. The goal of this system is to give non-
visual readers information similar to what vis-
ual readers get when skimming through a 
document in response to a question. 
1 Introduction 
This paper describes semantic considerations in 
developing a system for giving nonvisual readers 
information similar to what visual readers glean 
when skimming through a document in response to 
a question. Our eventual system will be unique in 
that it takes both simple and complex questions, 
will work in an unrestricted domain, will locate 
answers within a single document, and will return 
not just an answer to a question, but the informa-
tion visual skimmers acquire when skimming 
through a document.  
1.1 Goals 
Production of our skimming system will require 
the attainment of three major goals: 
1. Achieving an understanding of what information 
in the document visual skimmers pay attention 
to when skimming in response to a question 
2. Developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
techniques to automatically identify areas of text 
visual readers focus on as determined in 1. 
3. Developing a user interface to be used in con-
junction with screen reading software to deliver 
the visual skimming experience. 
In this paper we focus on the first two of these 
goals. Section 2 will discuss experiments analyzing 
visual skimmers skimming for answers to ques-
tions. Section 3 will discuss developing NLP tech-
niques to replicate the results of Section 2. Section 
4 will discuss future work. 
1.2 Impetus 
The impetus for this system was work done by the 
author with college students with visual impair-
ments who took significantly longer to complete 
homework problems than their visually reading 
counterparts. Students used both ScreenReaders, 
which read electronic text aloud, and screen mag-
nifiers, which increase the size of text on a screen. 
While these students were comfortable listening to 
the screenreader reading at rates of up to 500 
words per minute, their experience was quite dif-
ferent from their visual-reading peers. Even after 
listening to an entire chapter, when they wanted to 
return to areas of text that contained text relevant 
to the answer, they had to start listening from the 
beginning and traverse the document again. Doing 
98
homework was a tedious, time-consuming task 
which placed these students at a serious disadvan-
tage. It is clear that individuals with visual im-
pairments struggle in terms of education. By 
developing a system that levels the playing field in 
at least one area, we may make it easier for at least 
some individuals to succeed. 
2 Visual Skimming  
If our intention is to convey to nonvisual readers 
information similar to what visual readers acquire 
when skimming for answers to questions, we first 
must determine what information visual readers get 
when skimming. For our purposes, we were inter-
ested in what text readers focused on in connection 
to a question. While many systems exist that focus 
on answering simple, fact-based questions, we 
were more interested in more complex questions in 
which the answer could not be found using pattern 
matching and in which the answer would require at 
least a few sentences, not necessarily contiguous 
within a document. From an NLP standpoint, lo-
cating longer answers with relevant information 
occuring in more than one place that may or may 
not have words or word sequences in common with 
the question poses an interesting and difficult prob-
lem. The problem becomes making semantic con-
nections within any domain that are more loosely 
associated than the synonyms, hypernyms, hypo-
nyms, etc. provided by WordNet (Felbaum, 1998). 
Indeed, the questions that students had the most 
difficulty with were more complex in nature. Thus 
we needed to find out whether visual skimmers 
were able to locate text in documents relevant to 
complex questions and, if so, what connections 
visual skimmers are making in terms of the text 
they choose to focus on.  
2.1 Task Description 
To identify how visual readers skim documents to 
answer questions, we collected 14 questions ob-
tained from students? homework assignments, 
along with an accompanying document per ques-
tion from which the answer could be obtained. The 
questions chosen were on a wide variety of topics 
and were complex in nature. An example of a typi-
cal question is, ?According to Piaget, what tech-
niques do children use to adjust to their 
environment as they grow?? Documents largely 
consisted of plain text, although each had a title on 
the first page. They held no images and few sub-
titles or other areas users might find visually inter-
esting. Twelve of the documents were two pages in 
length, one was eight pages in length, and one was 
nine pages long. In each case, the answer to the 
question was judged by the researchers to be found 
within a single paragraph in the document.  
Forty-three visual reading subjects skimmed for 
the answer to between 6 ? 13 questions. The sub-
jects sat in front of a computer screen to which the 
Eye Tracker 1750 by Tobii Technologies was in-
stalled. The questions and accompanying docu-
ments were displayed on the computer screen and, 
after being calibrated, subjects were tracked as 
they skimmed for the answer. For the two-page 
documents, the question appeared at the top of the 
first page. For the longer documents, the question 
appeared at the top of each page. Subjects had no 
time limit for skimming and switched pages by 
pressing the space bar. When done skimming each 
document, subjects were asked to select a best an-
swer in multiple choice form (to give them a rea-
son to take the skimming task seriously).  
2.2 Results 
Results showed that subjects were reliably able to 
correctly answer the multiple choice question after 
skimming the document. Of the 510 questions, 423 
(about 86%) were answered correctly. The two 
questions from longer documents were the least 
likely to be answered correctly (one had 10 correct 
answers of 21 total answers, and the other had 10 
incorrect answers and only one correct answer).  
Clearly for the shorter documents, subjects were 
able to get appropriate information out of the doc-
ument to successfully answer the question. With 
that established, we were interested in analyzing 
the eye tracking data to see if there was a connec-
tion between where subjects spent the most time in 
the document and the question. If there was an un-
derstandable connection, the goal then became to 
automatically replicate those connections and thus 
automatically locate places in the text where sub-
jects were most likely to spend the most time. 
The Tobii Eye Tracking System tracks the path 
and length of time a subject gazes at a particular 
point as a subject skims through a document. The 
system allows us to define Areas of Interest (AOIs) 
and then track the number of prolonged gaze points 
99
within those areas of interest. For our analysis, we 
defined areas of interest as being individual para-
graphs. While we purposely chose documents that 
were predominantly text, each had a title as well. 
Titles and the few subtitles and lists that occurred 
in the documents were also defined as separate 
AOIs. For each skimming activity, the eye tracking 
system gave us a gaze plot showing the order in 
which individuals focused on particular areas, and 
a hot spot image showing the gaze points, with 
duration indicated with color intensity, that oc-
curred in each AOI (see Figure 1).  
In looking at the hot spot images, we found that 
subjects used three techniques to peruse a docu-
ment. One technique subjects used was to move 
their gaze slowly throughout the entire document, 
indicating that they were most likely reading the 
document. A second technique used was to move 
randomly and quickly from top to bottom of the 
document (described as ?fixations distributed in a 
rough zig-zag down the page? by McLaughlin in 
reference to speed reading (1969)), without ever 
focusing on one particular area for a longer period 
of time. This technique was the least useful to us 
because it gave very little information A third 
technique was a combination of the first two, in 
which the subject?s gaze darted quickly and ran-
domly around the page, and then appeared to focus 
on a particular area for an extended period of time. 
Figure 1 is a good example of this technique. The 
data from this group was clearly relevant to our 
task since their fixation points clearly showed what 
areas subjects found most interesting while skim-
ming for an answer to a question.  
2.3 Analysis of Skimming Data 
To determine exactly which AOIs subjects focused 
on most frequently, we counted the number of gaze 
points (or focus points) in each AOI (defined as 
paragraphs, titles, subtitles) across all subjects. In 
looking at what information individuals focused on 
while skimming, we found that individuals did fo-
cus on the title and subtitles that occurred in the 
documents. Subjects frequently focused on the first 
paragraph or paragraphs of a document. There was 
less of a tendency, but still a trend for focusing on 
the first paragraph on each page. Interestingly, al-
though a few subjects focused on the first line of 
each paragraph, this was not a common practice. 
This is significant because it is a technique availa-
ble to users of screenreaders, yet it clearly does not 
give these users the same information that visual 
skimmers get when skimming through a document.  
We also wanted to look at AOIs that did not 
have physical features that may have attracted at-
tention. Our conjecture was that these AOIs were 
focused on by subjects because of their semantic 
?
Figure 1. Hot spot image results of skimming for the answer to the question, ?What are two dietary factors 
thought to raise and lower cholesterol?? using the Tobii Eye Tracking System 
100
relationship to the question. Indeed, we did find 
evidence of this. Results indicated that subjects did 
focus on the areas of text containing the answer to 
the question. As an example, one of the questions 
used in the study was, 
?How do people catch the West Nile Vi-
rus?? 
The paragraph with the most gaze points for the 
most subjects was: 
?In the United States, wild birds, especial-
ly crows and jays, are the main reservoir 
of West Nile virus, but the virus is actually 
spread by certain species of mosquitoes. 
Transmission happens when a mosquito 
bites a bird infected with the West Nile vi-
rus and the virus enters the mosquito's 
bloodstream. It circulates for a few days 
before settling in the salivary glands. Then 
the infected mosquito bites an animal or a 
human and the virus enters the host's 
bloodstream, where it may cause serious 
illness. The virus then probably multiplies 
and moves on to the brain, crossing the 
blood-brain barrier. Once the virus 
crosses that barrier and infects the brain 
or its linings, the brain tissue becomes in-
flamed and symptoms arise.? 
This paragraph contains the answer to the ques-
tion, yet it has very few words in common with the 
question. The word it does have in common with 
the question, ?West Nile Virus?, is the topic of the 
document and occurs fairly frequently throughout 
the document, and thus cannot account for sub-
jects' focusing on this particular paragraph. 
 The subjects must have made semantic connec-
tions between the question and the answer that 
cannot be explained by simple word matching or 
even synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms. In the 
above example, the ability of the user to locate the 
answer hinged on their ability to make a connec-
tion between the word ?catch? in the question and 
its meaning ?to be infected by?. Clearly simple 
keyword matching won?t suffice in this case, yet 
equally clearly subjects successfully identified this 
paragraph as being relevant to the question. This 
suggests that when skimming subjects were able to 
make the semantic connections necessary to locate 
question answers, even when the answer was of a 
very different lexical form than the question. 
Other areas of text focused on also appear to 
have a semantic relationship with the question. For 
example, with the question, 
?Why was Monet?s work criticized by the 
public?? 
the second most frequently focused on paragraph 
was: 
?In 1874, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Renoir, 
Pissarro, Sisley and Monet put together an 
exhibition, which resulted in a large finan-
cial loss for Monet and his friends and 
marked a return to financial insecurity for 
Monet. It was only through the help of 
Manet that Monet was able to remain in 
Argenteuil. In an attempt to recoup some 
of his losses, Monet tried to sell some of 
his paintings at the Hotel Drouot. This, 
too, was a failure. Despite the financial 
uncertainty, Monet?s paintings never be-
came morose or even all that sombre. In-
stead, Monet immersed himself in the task 
of perfecting a style which still had not 
been accepted by the world at large. Mo-
net?s compositions from this time were ex-
tremely loosely structured, with color 
applied in strong, distinct strokes as if no 
reworking of the pigment had been at-
tempted. This technique was calculated to 
suggest that the artist had indeed captured 
a spontaneous impression of nature.? 
Of the 30 subjects who skimmed this document, 
15 focused on this paragraph, making it the second 
most focused on AOI in the document, second only 
to the paragraph that contained the answer (fo-
cused on by 21 of the subjects). The above para-
graph occurred within the middle of the second 
page of the document, with no notable physical 
attributes that would have attracted attention. Upon 
closer inspection of the paragraph, there are refer-
ences to ?financial loss,? ?financial insecurity,? 
?losses,? ?failure,? and ?financial uncertainty.? 
The paragraph also includes ?morose? and ?somb-
er? and even ?had not been accepted by the world 
at large.? Subjects appeared to be making a con-
nection between the question topic, Monet?s work 
being criticized by the public, and the above terms. 
Intuitively, we do seem to make this connection. 
Yet the connection being made is not straightfor-
ward and cannot be replicated using the direct se-
101
mantic connections that are available via WordNet. 
Indeed, the relationships made are more similar to 
Hovy and Lin?s (1997) Concept Signatures created 
by clustering words in articles with the same edi-
tor-defined classification from the Wall Street 
Journal. Our system must be able to replicate these 
connections automatically. 
 Upon further examination, we found other pa-
ragraphs that were focused on by subjects for rea-
sons other than their physical appearance or 
location, yet their semantic connection to the ques-
tion was even more tenuous. For instance, when 
skimming for the answer to the question, 
?How does marijuana affect the brain?? 
the second most frequently focused on paragraph 
(second to the paragraph with the answer) was,  
?The main active chemical in marijuana is 
THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The 
protein receptors in the membranes of cer-
tain cells bind to THC. Once securely in 
place, THC kicks off a series of cellular 
reactions that ultimately lead to the high 
that users experience when they smoke 
marijuana.? 
While this paragraph does appear to have loose 
semantic connections with the question, the con-
nections are less obvious than paragraphs that fol-
low it, yet it was this paragraph that subjects chose 
to focus on. The paragraph is the third to last para-
graph on the first page, so its physical location 
could not explain its attraction to subjects. Howev-
er, when we looked more closely at the previous 
paragraphs, we saw that the first paragraph deals 
with definitions and alternate names for marijuana 
(with no semantic links to the question), and the 
second and third paragraph deal with statistics on 
people who use marijuana (again, with no semantic 
connection to the question). The fourth paragraph, 
the one focused on, represents a dramatic semantic 
shift towards the topic of the question. Intuitively it 
makes sense that individuals skimming through the 
document would pay more attention to this para-
graph because it seems to represent the start of the 
area that may contain the answer, not to mention 
conveying topological information about the layout 
of the document and general content information 
as well.  
Data collected from these experiments suggest 
that subjects do make and skim for semantic con-
nections. Subjects not only glean information that 
directly answers the question, but also on content 
within the document that is semantically related to 
the question. While physical attributes of text do 
attract the attention of skimmers, and thus we must 
include methods for accessing this data as well, it 
is clear that in order to create a successful skim-
ming device that conveys information similar to 
what visual skimmers get when skimming for the 
answer to a question, we must come up with a me-
thod for automatically generating loose semantic 
connections and then using those semantic connec-
tions to locate text skimmers considered relevant 
within the document. 
3 NLP Techniques  
In order to automatically generate the semantic 
connections identified above as being those visual 
skimmers make, we want to explore Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) techniques. 
3.1 Related Research 
Potentially relevant methodologies may be found 
in Open Domain Question Answering Systems. 
Open Domain Question Answering Systems in-
volve connecting questions within any domain and 
potential answers. These systems usually do not 
rely on external knowledge sources and are limited 
in the amount of ontological information that can 
be included in the system. The questions are usual-
ly fact-based in form (e.g., ?How tall is Mt. Ever-
est??). These systems take a question and query a 
potentially large set of documents (e.g., the World 
Wide Web) to find the answer. A common tech-
nique is to determine a question type (e.g., ?How 
many ??? would be classified as ?numerical?, 
whereas ?Who was ??? would be classified as 
?person?, etc.) and then locate answers of the cor-
rect type (Abney et al, 2000; Kwok et al, 2001; 
Srihari and Li, 2000; Galea, 2003). Questions are 
also frequently reformulated for pattern matching 
(e.g., ?Who was the first American Astronaut in 
space?? becomes, ?The first American Astronaut 
in space was? (Kwok et al, 2001; Brill et al, 
2002)). Many systems submit multiple queries to a 
document corpus, relying on redundancy of the 
answer to handle incorrect answers, poorly con-
structed answers or documents that don?t contain 
the answer (e.g., Brill et al, 2002; Kwok et al, 
102
2001). For these queries, systems often include 
synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc. in the query 
terms used for document and text retrieval (Hovy 
et al,2000; Katz et al, 2005). In an attempt to an-
swer more complex relational queries, Banko et al 
(2007) parsed training data into relational tuples 
for use in classifying text tagged for part of speech, 
chunked into noun phrases, and then tagged the 
relations for probability. Soricut and Brill (2006) 
trained data on FAQ knowledge bases from the 
World Wide Web, resulting in approximately 1 
million question-answer pairs. This system related 
potential answers to questions using probability 
models computed using the FAQ knowledge base. 
Another area of research that may lend useful 
techniques for connecting and retrieving relevant 
text to a question is query-biased text summariza-
tion. With many summarization schemes, a good 
deal of effort has been placed on identifying the 
main topic or topics of the document. In query bi-
ased text summarization, however, the topic is 
identified a priori, and the task is to locate relevant 
text within a document or set of documents. In 
multidocument summarization systems, redundan-
cy may be indicative of relevance, but should be 
eliminated from the resulting summary. Thus a 
concern is measuring relevance versus redundancy 
(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Hovy et al, 2005; 
Otterbacher et al, 2006). Like Question Answering 
systems, many summarization systems simply 
match the query terms, expanded to include syn-
onyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc., to text in the 
document or documents (Varadarajan and Hristi-
dis, 2006; Chali, 2002)  
Our system is unique in that it has as its goal not 
just to answer a question or create a summary, but 
to return information visual skimmers glean while 
skimming through a document. Questions posed to 
the system will range from simple to complex in 
nature, and the answer must be found within a sin-
gle document, regardless of the form the answer 
takes. Questions can be on any topic. With com-
plex questions, it is rarely possible to categorize 
the type of question (and thus the expected answer 
type). Intuitively, it appears equally useless to at-
tempt reformulation of the query for pattern match-
ing. This intuition is born out by Soricut and Brill 
(2006) who stated that in their study reformulating 
complex questions more often hurt performance 
than improved it. Answering complex questions 
within a single document when the answer may not 
be straightforward in nature poses a challenging 
problem. 
3.2 Baseline Processing 
Our baseline system attempted to identify areas of 
interest by matching against the query in the tradi-
tion of Open Domain Question Answering. For our 
baseline, we used the nonfunction words in each 
question as our query terms. The terms were 
weighted with a variant of TF/IDF (Salton and 
Buckley, 1988) in which terms were weighted by 
the inverse of the number of paragraphs they oc-
curred in within the document. This weighting 
scheme was designed to give lower weight to 
words associated with the document topic and thus 
conveying less information about relevance to the 
question. Each query term was matched to text in 
each paragraph, and paragraphs were ranked for 
matching using the summation of, for each query 
term, the number of times it occurred in the para-
graph multiplied by its weight.  
Results of this baseline ranking were poor. In 
none of the 14 documents did this method connect 
the question to the text relevant to the answer. This 
was expected. This original set of questions was 
purposely chosen because of the complex relation-
ship between the question and answer text. 
Next we expanded the set of query terms to in-
clude synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms as 
defined in WordNet (Felbaum, 1998). We included 
all senses of each word (query term). Irrelevant 
senses resulted in the inclusion of terms that were 
no more likely to occur frequently than any other 
random word, and thus had no effect on the result-
ing ranking of paragraphs. Again, each of the 
words in the expanded set of query terms was 
weighted as described above, and paragraphs were 
ranked accordingly. 
Again, results were poor. Paragraphs ranked 
highly were no more likely to contain the answer, 
nor were they likely to be areas focused on by the 
visual skimmers in our collected skimming data.  
Clearly, for complex questions, we need to ex-
pand on these basic techniques to replicate the se-
mantic connections individuals make when 
skimming. As our system must work across a vast 
array of domains, our system must make these 
connections ?on the fly? without relying on pre-
viously defined ontological or other general know-
ledge. And our system must work quickly: asking 
103
individuals to wait long periods of time while the 
system creates semantic connections and locates 
appropriate areas of text would defeat the purpose 
of a system designed to save its users time. 
3.3 Semantically-Related Word Clusters 
Our solution is to use the World Wide Web to form 
clusters of topically-related words, with the topic 
being the question. The cluster of words will be 
used as query terms and matched to paragraphs as 
described above for ranking relevant text.  
Using the World Wide Web as our corpus has a 
number of advantages. Because of the vast number 
of documents that make up the World Wide Web, 
we can rely on the redundancy that has proved so 
useful for Question Answering and Text Summari-
zation systems. By creating the word clusters from 
documents returned from a search using question 
words, the words that occur most frequently in the 
related document text will most likely be related in 
some way to the question words. Even relatively 
infrequently occurring word correlations can most 
likely be found in some document existing on the 
Web, and thus strangely-phrased questions or 
questions with odd terms will still most likely 
bring up some documents that can be used to form 
a cluster. The Web covers virtually all domains. 
Somewhere on the Web there is almost certainly an 
answer to questions on even the most obscure top-
ics. Thus questions containing words unique to 
uncommon domains or questions containing un-
usual word senses will return documents with ap-
propriate cluster words. Finally, the Web is 
constantly being updated. Terms that might not 
have existed even a year ago will now be found on 
the Web. 
Our approach is to use the nonstop words in a 
question as query terms for a Web search. The 
search engine we are using is Google 
(www.google.com). For each search engine query, 
Google returns an ranked list of URLs it considers 
relevant, along with a snippet of text it considers 
most relevant to the query (usually because of 
words in the snippet that exactly match the query 
terms). To create the cluster of words related se-
mantically to the question, we are taking the top 50 
URLs, going to their correlating Web page, locat-
ing the snippet of text within the page, and creating 
a cluster of words using a 100-word window sur-
rounding the snippet. We are using only nonstop 
words in the cluster, and weighting the words 
based on their total number of occurrences in the 
windows. These word clusters, along with the ex-
panded baseline words, are used to locate and rank 
paragraphs in our question document. 
Our approach is similar in spirit to other re-
searchers using the Web to identify semantic rela-
tions. Matsuo et al (2006) looked at the number of 
hits of each of two words as a single keyword ver-
sus the number of hits using both words as key-
words to rate the semantic similarity of two words. 
Chen et al (2006) used a similar approach to de-
termine the semantic similarity between two 
words: with a Web search using word P as the 
query term, they counted the number of times word 
Q occurred in the snippet of text returned, and vice 
versa. Bollegala et al (2007) determined semantic 
relationships by extracting lexico-syntactic patterns 
from the snippets returned from a search on two 
keywords (e.g.,??x? is a ?y??) and extracting the 
relationship of the two words based on the pattern. 
Sahami and Heilman (2006) used the snippets from 
a word search to form a set of words weighted us-
ing TF/IDF, and then determined the semantic si-
milarity of two keywords by the similarity of two 
word sets returned in those snippets.  
Preliminary results from our approach have been 
encouraging. For example, with the question, 
?How does Marijuana affect the brain??, the ex-
panded set of keywords included, ?hippocampus, 
receptors, THC, memory, neuron?. These words 
were present in both the paragraph containing the 
answer and the second-most commonly focused on 
paragraph in our study. While neither our baseline 
nor our expanded baseline identified either para-
graph as an area of interest, the semantically-
related word clusters did. 
4 Future Work 
This system is a work in progress. There are many 
facets still under development, including a finer 
analysis of visual skimming data, a refinement of 
the ranking system for locating areas of interest 
within a document, and the development of the 
system?s user interface. 
4.1 Skimming Data Analysis 
For our initial analysis, we focused on the length of 
time users spent gazing at text areas. In future 
104
analysis, we will look at the order of the gaze 
points to determine exactly where the subjects first 
gazed before choosing to focus on a particular 
area. This may give us even more information 
about the type of semantic connection subjects 
made before choosing to focus on a particular area. 
In addition, in our initial analysis, we defined AOIs 
to be paragraphs. We may want to look at smaller 
AOIs. For example, with longer paragraphs, the 
text that actually caught the subject?s eye may have 
occurred only in one portion of the paragraph, yet 
as the analysis stands now the entire content of the 
paragraph is considered relevant and thus we are 
trying to generate semantic relationships between 
the question and potentially unrelated text. While 
the system only allows us to define AOIs as rec-
tangular areas (and thus we can?t do a sentence-by-
sentence analysis), we may wish to define AOIs as 
small as 2 lines of text to narrow in on exactly 
where subjects chose to focus.  
4.2 Ranking System Refinement 
It is worth mentioning that, while a good deal of 
research has been done on evaluating the goodness 
of automatically generated text summaries (Mani 
et al,2002; Lin and Hovy, 2003; Santos et al, 
2004) our system is intended to mimic the actions 
of skimmers when answering questions, and thus 
our measure of goodness will be our system?s 
ability to recreate the retrieval of text focused on 
by our visual skimmers. This gives us a distinct 
advantage over other systems in measuring good-
ness, as defining a measure of goodness can prove 
difficult. In future work, we will be exploring dif-
ferent methods of ranking text such that the system 
returns results most similar to the results obtained 
from the visual skimming studies. The system will 
then be used on other questions and documents and 
compared to data to be collected of visual skim-
mers skimming for answers to those questions. 
Many variations on the ranking system are poss-
ible. These will be explored to find the best 
matches with our collected visual skimming data. 
Possibilities include weighting keywords different-
ly according to where they came from (e.g., direct-
ly from the question, from the text in retrieved 
Web pages, from text from a Web page ranked 
high on the returned URL list or lower, etc.), or 
considering how a diversity of documents might 
affect results. For instance, if keywords include 
?falcon? and ?hawk? the highest ranking URLs will 
most likely be related to birds. However, in G.I. 
Joe, there are two characters, Lieutenant Falcon 
and General Hawk. To get the less common con-
nection between falcon and hawk and G.I. Joe, one 
may have to look for diversity in the topics of the 
returned URLs. Another area to be explored will 
be the effect of varying the window size surround-
ing the snippet of text to form the bag of words.  
4.3 User Interface 
The user interface for our system poses some inter-
esting questions. It is important that the output of 
the system provide the user with information about 
(1) document topology, (2) document semantics, 
and (3) information most relevant to answering the 
question. At the same time, it is important that us-
ing the output be relatively fast. The output of the 
system is envisioned as a Web page with ranked 
links at the top pointing to sections of the text like-
ly to be relevant to answering the question.  
An important issue that must be explored in 
depth with potential users of the system is the ex-
act form of the output web page. We need to ex-
plore the best method for indicating text areas of 
interest and the overall topology. The goal is that 
reading the links simulate what a visual skimmer 
gets from lightly skimming. The user would actual-
ly follow the links that appeared to be ?worth read-
ing? in more detail in the same way that skimmers 
focus in on particular text segments that appear 
worth reading.  
5 Conclusion 
This system attempts to correlate NLP techniques 
for creating semantic connections with the seman-
tic connections individuals make. Using the World 
Wide Web, we may be able to make those seman-
tic connections across any topic in a reasonable 
amount of time without any previously defined 
knowledge. We have ascertained that people can 
and do make semantic links when skimming for 
answers to questions, and we are currently explor-
ing the best use of the World Wide Web in repli-
cating those connections. In the long run, we 
envision a system that is user-friendly to nonvisual 
and low vision readers that will give them an intel-
ligent way to skim through documents for answers 
to questions.
