Abstract
Though much research has been conducted
on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA)
during the last decade, little work has fo-
cused on Arabic. In this work, we focus on
SSA for both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
news articles and dialectal Arabic microblogs
from Twitter. We showcase some of the chal-
lenges associated with SSA on microblogs.
We adopted a random graph walk approach to
extend the Arabic SSA lexicon using Arabic-
English phrase tables, leading to improve-
ments for SSA on Arabic microblogs. We
used different features for both subjectivity
and sentiment classification including stem-
ming, part-of-speech tagging, as well as tweet
specific features. Our classification features
yield results that surpass Arabic SSA results
in the literature.
1 Introduction
Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has gained con-
siderable attention in the last few years. SSA has
many applications ranging from identifying con-
sumer sentiment towards products to voters? reac-
tion to political adverts. A significant amount of
work has focused on analyzing English text with
measurable success on news articles and product re-
views. There has been recent efforts pertaining to
expanding SSA to languages other than English and
to analyzing social text such as tweets. To enable ef-
fective SSA for new languages and genres, two main
requirements are necessary: (a) subjectivity lexicons
that broadly cover sentiment carrying words in the
genre or language; and (b) tagged corpora to train
subjectivity and sentiment classifiers. These two
are often scarce or nonexistent when expanding to
new languages or genres. In this paper we focus
on performing SSA on Arabic news articles and mi-
croblogs. There has been some recent work on Ara-
bic SSA. However, the available resources continue
to lag in the following ways:
(1) The size of existing subjectivity lexicons is
small, with low coverage in practical application.
(2) The available tagged corpora are limited to the
news domain, with no publicly available tagged cor-
pora for tweets.
To address the issue of limited lexicons, we applied
two methods to build large coverage lexicons. In the
first, we used Machine Translation (MT) to trans-
late an existing English subjectivity lexicon. In the
second, we employed a random graph walk method
to automatically expand a manually curated Ara-
bic lexicon. For the later method, we used Arabic-
English MT phrase tables that include both Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) as well as dialectal Arabic.
As for tagged corpora, we annotated a new corpus
that includes 2,300 Arabic tweets. We describe in
detail the process of collecting tweets and some of
the major attributes of tweets.
The contribution of this paper is as follows:
- We introduce strong baselines that employ Arabic
specific processing including stemming, POS tag-
ging, and tweets normalization. The baseline outper-
forms state-of-the-art subjectivity classification for
the news domain.
- We provide a new annotated dataset for Arabic
tweet SSA.
- We employ a random graph walk algorithm to ex-
55
pand SSA lexicons, leading to improvements for
SSA for Arabic tweets.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 surveys related work; section 3
introduces some of the challenges associated with
Arabic SSA; section 4 describes the lexicons we
used; section 5 presents the experimental setup and
results; and section 6 concludes the paper and dis-
cusses future work.
2 Related Work
There has been a fair amount work on SSA.
Liu (2010) offers a thorough survey of SSA re-
search. He defines the problem of sentiment anal-
ysis including associated SSA terms such as ob-
ject, opinion, opinion holder, emotions, sentence
subjectivity, etc. He also discusses the more popu-
lar two stage sentiment and subjectivity classifica-
tion approach at different granularities (document
and sentence levels) using different machine learn-
ing approaches (supervised and unsupervised) along
with different ways to construct the required data re-
sources (corpora and lexicon). In our work, we clas-
sify subjectivity and sentiment in a cascaded fashion
following Wilson et al (2005).
2.1 Subjectivity Analysis
One of most prominent features for subjectivity
analysis is the existence of words in a subjectivity
lexicon. Mihalcea et al (2007) translated an ex-
isting English subjectivity lexicon from Wiebe and
Riloff (2005) using a bilingual dictionary. They also
used a subjectivity classifier to automatically anno-
tate the English side of an English-Romanian paral-
lel corpus and then project the annotations to the Ro-
manian side. The projected annotations were used
to train a subjectivity classifier. In follow on work,
Banea et al (2010) used MT to exploit annotated
SSA English corpora for other languages, including
Arabic. They also integrated features from multiple
languages to train a combined classifier. In Banea
et al (2008), they compared the automatic annota-
tion of non-English text that was machine translated
into English to automatically or manually translating
annotated English text to train a classifier in the tar-
get language. In all these cases, they concluded that
translation can help avail the need for building lan-
guage specific resources. In performing both subjec-
tivity and sentiment classification, researchers have
used word, phrase, sentence, and topic level fea-
tures. Wilson et al (2005) report on such features
in detail, and we use some of their features in our
baseline runs. For Arabic subjectivity classification,
Abdul-Mageed et al (2011) performed sentence-
level binary classification. They used a manually cu-
rated subjectivity lexicon and corpus that was drawn
from news articles (from Penn Arabic tree bank).
They used features that are akin to those devel-
oped by Wilson et al (2005). In later work, Abdul-
Mageed et al (2012) extended their work to social
content including chat sessions, tweets, Wikipedia
discussion pages, and online forums. Unfortunately,
their tweets corpus is not publicly available. They
added social media features such as author informa-
tion (person vs. organization and gender). They
also explored Arabic specific features that include
stemming, POS tagging, and dialect vs. MSA. Their
most notable conclusions are: (a) POS tagging helps
and (b) Most dialectal Arabic tweets are subjective.
Concerning work on subjectivity classification on
English tweets, Pak and Paroubek (2010) created a
corpus of tweets for SSA. They made a few funda-
mental assumptions that do not generalize to Arabic
well, namely:
- They assumed that smiley and sad emoticons imply
positive and negative sentiment respectively. Due
to the right-to-left orientation of Arabic text, smi-
ley and sad emoticons can be easily interchanged by
mistake in Arabic.
- They also assumed that news tweets posted by
newspapers Twitter accounts are neutral. This as-
sumption is not valid for Arabic news articles be-
cause many Arabic newspapers are overly critical or
biased in their reporting of news. Thus, the major-
ity of news site tweets have sentiment. Consider the
following headline:

meaning: Religious Council critical of State Secu-
rity over interference in hiring of clerics.
- They constructed their tweet sets to be uniformly
distributed between subjective and objective classes.
However, our random sample of Arabic tweets
showed that 70% of Arabic tweets are subjective.
So this kind of training is misleading especially for a
Na??ve Bayesian classifier that utilizes the prior prob-
ability of classes.
2.2 Sentiment Analysis
Abbasi et al (2008) focused on conducting senti-
ment classification at document level. They used
56
syntactic, stylistic, and morphological (for Arabic)
features to perform classification. Abdul-Mageed et
al. (2011) performed sentence-level sentiment clas-
sification for MSA. They concluded that the ap-
pearance of a positive or negative adjective, based
on their lexicon, is the most important feature. In
later work, Abdul-Mageed et al (2012) extended
their work to social text. They concluded that: (a)
POS tags are not as effective in sentiment classifi-
cation as in the subjectivity classification, and (b)
most dialectal Arabic tweets are negative. Lastly,
they projected that extending/adapting polarity lex-
icon to new domains; e.g. social media; would re-
sult in higher gains. Kok and Brockett (2010) in-
troduced a random-walk-base approach to generate
paraphrases from parallel corpora. They proved to
be more effective in generating more paraphrases by
traversing paths of lengths longer than 2. El-Kahky
et al (2011) applied graph reinforcement on translit-
eration mining problem to infer mappings that were
unseen in training. We used this graph reinforce-
ment method in our work.
3 Challenges for SSA of Arabic
Arabic SSA faces many challenges due to the poor-
ness of language resources and to Arabic-specific
linguistic features.
Lexicon: Lexicons containing words with prior
polarity are crucial feature for SSA. The most com-
mon English lexicon that has been used in liter-
ature is the Multi-Perspective Question Answer-
ing (MPQA) lexicon, which contains 8,000 words.
Some relied on the use of MT to translate English
lexicons to languages that lack SSA resources (Mi-
halcea et al, 2007). A lexicon that is translated
into Arabic may have poor coverage due to the mor-
phological and orthographic complexities of Arabic.
Arabic nouns and verbs are typically derived from a
set of 10,000 roots that are cast into stems using tem-
plates that may add infixes, double letters, or remove
letters. Stems can accept the attachment of prefixes
or suffixes, such as prepositions, determiners, pro-
nouns, etc. The number of possible Arabic surface
forms is in the order of billions. In this work, we
employed stemming and graph reinforcement to im-
prove the converge of lexicons.
Negation: Negation in dialects can be expressed
in many ways. In MSA, the word ?
? (meaning
?not?) is typically used to negate adjectives. Dialects
use many words to negate adjectives including:??A?,
??, ??, A?, ?	J?, etc. These words can have other
meanings also. For example, ??A? also means ?what
is?. As for verbs, some dialects like Egyptian and
Levantine use a negation construct akin to the ?ne
... pas? construct in French. All these make detect-
ing negation hard. We use word n-gram features to
overcome this problem.
Emoticons: Another challenge has to do with
the limited usefulness of emoticons, because Ara-
bic?s smileys and sad emoticons are often mistak-
enly interchanged. Thus, many tweets have words
and emoticons that are contradictory in sentiment.
For example:
): ??

A? @ 	?? ?J
?? ?<

? @ ???.
meaning: with the help of God over your pain (pos-
itive) : followed by a sad face
(: A?D
?? ?<

? @ ?


?
.
?k I
	
k

@' ?


Y
	
J? A
	
K

@
meaning: I have a sister from which I seek the pro-
tection of Allah (negative) : followed by a smilie
Use of dialects: Though most Arabic speakers
can read and understand MSA, they generally use
different Arabic dialects in their daily interactions
including online social interaction 1. There are
6 dominant dialects, namely Egyptian, Moroccan,
Levantine, Iraqi, Gulf, and Yemeni. Dialects intro-
duce many new words into the language, particularly
stopwords (ex. YgA? and ?	J ? mean ?no one? and
?what? respectively). Dialects lack spelling stan-
dards (ex. ? 	Q??A? and ? 	Q??? are varying spellings
of ?I did not know? in Egyptian). Different dialects
make different lexical choices for concepts (ex. ?


?AK.
and ?


	
?A? mean ?good? in Morrocan and Libyan re-
spectively). Due to morphological divergence of di-
alectal text from MSA, word prefixes and suffixes
could be different. For example, Egyptian and Lev-
antine tend to insert the letter H. (?ba?) before verbs
in present tense. Building lexicons that cover multi-
ple dialects is cumbersome. Further, using MT to
build SSA lexicons would be suboptimal because
most MT systems perform poorly on dialects of Ara-
1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_
of_Arabic
57
bic.
Tweet specific phenomena: Tweets may con-
tain transliterated words (?LOL? ? ???) and non-
Arabic words, particularly hashtags such as #syria.
Tweets are often characterized by the informality
of language and the presence of name mentions
(@user mention), hashtags, and URL?s. Further,
tweets often contain a significant percentage of mis-
spelled words.
Contradictory language: Often words with neg-
ative sentiment are used to express positive senti-
ment:

meaning: a female pretends to be cold and uninter-
ested and may even use hurtful words. Know that
she painfully loves you.
Other observations: We also observed the fol-
lowing:
- Users tend to express their feelings through ex-
tensive use of Quranic verses, Prophetic sayings,
proverbs, and poetry.
- Of the annotated tweets in our corpus, nearly
13.5% were sarcastic.
- People primarily use tweets to share their thoughts
and feelings and to report facts to a lesser extent. In
the set we annotated, 70% of the tweets were sub-
jective and 30% were objective. Of the subjective
tweets (positive and negative only), the percentage
of positive tweets was 66% compared to 34% for
negative tweets.
4 SSA Lexicon
We employed two lexicons that were available to us,
namely:
- The MPQA lexicon, which contains 8,000 English
words that were manually annotated as strong sub-
jective (subjective in most contexts) or weak sub-
jective (subjective in some contexts) and with their
prior polarity (positive, negative, neutral, or both).
We used the Bing online MT system 2 to translate
the MPQA lexicon into Arabic.
- The ArabSenti lexicon (Abdul-Mageed et al,
2011) containing 3,982 adjectives that were ex-
tracted from news data and labeled as positive, neg-
2http://www.bing.com/translator/
Figure 1: Example mappings seen in phrase table
ative, or neutral. We optionally used graph rein-
forcement to expand the ArabSenti lexicon using
MT phrase tables, which were modeled as a bipar-
tite graph (El-Kahky et al, 2011). As shown in Fig-
ure 1, given a seed lexicon, graph reinforcement is
then used to enrich the lexicon by inferring addi-
tional mappings. Specifically, given the word with
the dotted outline, it may map to the words ?unfair?
and ?unjust? in English that in turn map to other Ara-
bic words, which are potentially synonymous to the
original word. We applied a single graph reinforce-
ment iteration over two phrase tables that were gen-
erated using Moses (Koehn et al, 2007). The two
phrase tables were:
- an English-MSA phrase table, which was trained
on a set of 3.69 million parallel sentences contain-
ing 123.4 million English tokens. The sentences
were drawn from the UN parallel data along with
a variety of parallel news data from LDC and the
GALE project. The Arabic side was stemmed (by
removing just prefixes) using the Stanford word seg-
menter (Green and DeNero, 2012).
- an English-Dialect phrase table, which was trained
on 176K short parallel sentences containing 1.8M
Egyptian, Levantine, and Gulf dialectal words and
2.1M English words (Zbib et al, 2012). The Ara-
bic side was also stemmed using the Stanford word
segmenter.
More formally, Arabic seed words and their En-
glish translations were represented using a bipartite
graph G = (S, T, M), where S was the set of Arabic
words, T was the set of English words, and M was
the set of mappings (links or edges) between S and
T. First, we found all possible English translations
T ? ? T for each Arabic word si ? S in the seed
lexicon. Then, we found all possible Arabic trans-
lations S? ? S of the English translations T ?. The
mapping score m(sj ? S?|si) would be computed
58
as:
1?
?
?sj ,si?S,t?T ?
(1?
p(t|si)
?
t p(si|t)
p(sj |t)
?
sj
p(t|sj)
) (1)
where the terms in the denominator are normaliza-
tion factors and the product computes the probability
that a mapping is not correct given all the paths from
which it was produced. Hence, the score of an in-
ferred mapping would be boosted if it was obtained
from multiple paths, because the product would have
a lower value.
5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Corpus, Classification, and Processing
For subjectivity and sentiment classification exper-
iments on Arabic MSA news, we used the trans-
lated MPQA dataset and the ArabSenti dataset re-
spectively. As for SSA on Arabic tweets, to the
best of our knowledge, there is no publicly avail-
able dataset. Thus, we built our own. We crawled
Twitter using the Twitter4j API (Yanamoto, 2011)
using the query ?lang:ar? to restrict tweets to Ara-
bic ones only. In all, we collected 65 million unique
Arabic tweets in the time period starting from Jan-
uary to December 2012; we made sure that dupli-
cate tweets were ignored during crawling. Then we
randomly sampled 2300 tweets (nearly 30k words)
from the collected set and we gave them to two na-
tive Arabic speakers to manually annotate. If the two
annotators disagreed on the annotation of a tweet,
they discussed it to resolve the disagreement. If they
couldn?t resolve the disagreement, then the tweet
was discarded, which would somewhat affect the
SSA effectiveness numbers. They applied one of
five possible labels to the tweets, namely: neutral,
positive, negative, both, or sarcastic. For subjectiv-
ity analysis, all classes other than neutral were con-
sidered subjective. As for sentiment analysis, we
only considered positive and negative tweets. For
both subjectivity and sentiment classification exper-
iments, we used 10-fold cross validation with 90/10
training/test splits. We used the NLTK (Bird, 2006)
implementation of the Na??ve Bayesian classifier for
all our experiments. In offline experiments, the
Bayesian classifier performed slightly better than an
SVM classifier. The classifier assigned a sentence or
tweet the class c ? C that maximizes:
argmax
c?C
P (c)
n?
i=1
P (fi|c) (2)
where f is the feature vector and C is the set of
pre-defined classes. As for stemming and POS
Tagging, we used an in-house reimplementation of
AMIRA (Diab, 2009). We report accuracy as well
as precision, recall and F-measure for each class.
5.2 Baseline: SSA for MSA
5.2.1 Subjectivity Classification
As mentioned in section 2, we employed some of
the SSA features that were shown to be successful in
the literature (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wilson et al,
2005; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) to construct
our baseline objective-subjective classifier. We used
the automatically translated MPQA and the Arab-
Senti lexicons. We tokenized and stemmed all words
in the dataset and the lexicon. Part of the tokeniza-
tion involved performing letter normalization where
the variant forms of alef (

@,

@, and @) were normal-
ized to the bare alef ( @), different forms of hamza ( ?'
and Z?') were normalized to hamza (Z), ta marbouta
( ?) was normalized to ha ( ?), and alef maqsoura (?)
was normalized to ya (?


). We used the following
features:
Stem-level features:
- Stem is a binary features that indicates the presence
of the stem in the sentence.
- Stem prior polarity as indicated in the translated
MPQA and ArabSenti lexicons (positive, negative,
both or neutral). Stems and their prior polarity were
reportedly the most important features in Wilson et
al. (2005).
- Stem POS, which has been shown to be effective in
the work done by (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). Although Abdul-Mageed
et al (2011) used a feature to indicate if a stem
is an adjective or not, other tags, such as adverbs,
nouns, and verbs, may be good indicators of senti-
ment. Thus, we used a feature that indicates the POS
tag of a stem as being: adjective, adverb, noun, IV,
PV, or other, concatenated with the stem. For exam-
ple, the stem ?play? may be assigned ?play-noun?
if it appears as a noun in a sentence. We chose this
reduced POS set based on the frequency distribution

of POS tags and subjectivity classes in the training
data.
- Stem context as the stem bi-gram containing the
stem along with the previous stem. We experi-
mented with higher order stem n-grams, but bigrams
yielded the best results.
Sentence features: These features have been
shown to be effective by Wiebe and Riloff (2005).
They include:
- Counts of stems belonging to so-called reliabil-
ity classes (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), which are ba-
sically either strong-subjective and weak-subjective
tokens (as indicated in the SSA lexicon).
- Counts of POS tags where we used the counts of
the POS tags that used for stem features (adjective,
adverb, noun, IV, and PV).
We compared our baseline results with the results
reported by Banea et al (2010) for Arabic subjec-
tivity classification. We used their Arabic MPQA
corpus that has been automatically translated from
English and then projected subjectivity labels with
the same training/test splits. The 9,700 sentences
in this corpus are nearly balanced with a 55/45 sub-
jective/objective ratio. Table 1 shows the results for
MSA subjectivity classification compared to the re-
sults of Banea et al (2010). Our baseline system im-
proved upon the results of Banea et al (2010) by 5%
(absolute) in accuracy with significant gains in both
precision and recall. Using MPQA or ArabSenti lex-
icons yielded comparable results with MPQA yield-
ing marginally better results. We think that much
of improvement that we achieve over the results of
Banea et al (2010) could be attributed to stemming
and POS tagging.
5.2.2 Polarity Classification
For polarity classification experiments, we used
the positive and negative sentences from the Arab-
Senti dataset (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2011).
From the 2,855 sentences in ArabSenti, 45% were
objective, 17.2% were positive, 24.1% were nega-
tive and the rest were both. We employed the fol-
lowing features:
Stem-level features:
- Stem, Stem prior polarity, and Stem POS tag as in
subjectivity classification
- Stem context where we considered a stem and the
two preceding stems. In offline experiments, we
tried looking at more and less context and using the
two previous stems yielded the best results. The in-
tuition to use stem context is to compensate for the
difficulties associated with ?negation? in Arabic (as
mentioned earlier section 3).
Sentence-level features: We used only one bi-
nary feature that checks for the occurrence of pos-
itive adjectives in the sentence. We experimented
with other features that aggregate other POS tags
with their prior polarity including negative adjec-
tives and all led to worse classification results.
Table 2 reports on the baseline results of doing
sentiment classification. The results of using either
MPQA or ArabSenti lexicons were comparable.

5.3 Baseline: SSA of Arabic Microblogs
5.3.1 Subjectivity Classification
We have four baselines for subjectivity classifica-
tion of Arabic tweets, namely:
Baseline-Majority-Class for which we considered
all the tweets to be subjective, where ?subjective?
was the majority class.
Baseline-MSA for which we used the aforemen-
tioned MSA subjectivity classifier using the MPQA
lexicon (section 5.2).
Baseline-MPQA and Baseline-ArabSenti for
which we used microblog specific features and the
MPQA and ArabSenti lexicons respectively. We
used the following features:
Stem-level features:
- Stems, where we normalized words using the
scheme described by Darwish et al (2012). Their
work extended the basic Arabic normalization to
handle non-Arabic characters that were borrowed
from Farsi and Urdu for decoration decorate and
words elongation and shortening. After normaliza-
tion, words were stemmed.
- MSA or dialect, which is a binary feature that indi-
cates whether the stem appears in a large MSA stem
list (containing 82,380 stems) which was extracted
from a large Arabic news corpus from Aljazeera.net.
- Stem prior polarity and Stem POS as those for
MSA subjectivity classification.
Tweets-specific features: Following Barbosa and
Feng (2010) and Kothari et al (2013), we took ad-
vantage of tweet specific features, namely:
- Presence of hashtag (#tag).
- Presence of user mention (@some user) and posi-
tion in the tweet (start, end and middle).
- Presence of URL and position in the tweet (start,
end and middle).
- Presence of retweet symbol ?RT? and position in
the tweet (start, end and middle).
?RT? and URL?s usually appear in the beginning
and end of tweets respectively, particularly when
retweeting news articles. A change in their position
may indicate that the person retweeting added text
to the tweet, often containing opinions or sentiment.
Language-independent features: These are bi-
nary features that look for non-lexical markers that
may indicate sentiment. They are:
- Usage of decorating characters. e.g. ? instead of
?.
- Elongation (detecting both repeated uni-gram & bi-
gram character patterns. e.g. ?????? (looool), A?A?A?
(hahaha).
- Punctuation; exclamation and question marks.
- Elongated punctuation marks (e.g. ???, !!!!!)
- Emoticons (e.g. :), :(, :P ... etc.).
Sentence-level features: We used the counts of
so-called reliability classes, which count the number
of strong-subjective and weak-subjective words.
Table 3 shows the results for subjectivity anal-
ysis on tweets. Baseline-Majority-Class was the
best given that most Arabic tweets were subjec-
61
tive. Tweet-specific features were not discrimina-
tive enough to outperform Baseline-Majority-Class.
Thus, assuming that all tweets are subjective seems
to be the most effective option. However, it is worth
noting that using a classifier that was trained on di-
alectal tweets yielded better results than using a clas-
sifier that was trained on news in MSA. Again using
either lexicon made little difference.
5.3.2 Polarity Classification
Our work on MSA showed that stem and stem
prior polarity are the most important features for
this task. We used these two features, and we added
a third binary feature that indicates the presence of
positive emoticons. Negative emoticons appeared
infrequently in both training and test sets. Hence us-
ing a feature that indicates the presence of negative
emoticons would be unreliable. Again we used the
MPQA or ArabSenti lexicons, both of which were
constructed from news domain (Baseline-MPQA
and Baseline-ArabSenti respectively). For refer-
ence, we used the sentiment classifier trained on the
MSA news set as a reference (Baseline-MSA). Ta-
ble 4 shows the results for sentiment classification
on tweets. Training a classifier with in-domain data
(tweets) enhanced classification effectiveness signif-
icantly with a gain of 17.4% (absolute) in accuracy
and 17.2% and 16.1% (absolute) improvement in
F-measure for positive and negative classes respec-
tively. We saw that MPQA led to slightly better re-
sults than ArabSenti.
5.4 Lexicon Expansion
We chose to expand the ArabSenti lexicon using
graph reinforcement instead of the MPQA lexi-
con because the ArabSenti was curated manually.
The MPQA lexicon had many translation errors
and automatic expansion would have likely mag-
nified the errors. We repeated all our Baseline-
ArabSenti experiments using the expanded Arab-
Senti lexicon. We expanded using the English-MSA
(Expanded-ArabSenti-MSA) and the English-
Dialect (Expanded-ArabSenti-Dialect) phrase ta-
bles.
Table 1 reports on the expansion results for MSA
news subjectivity classification. The expanded lexi-
con marginally lowered classification effectiveness.
This is surprising given that the number of tokens
that matched the lexicon increased more than five
fold compared to the baseline (105k matches for
the baseline and 567k and 550k matches for the
English-MSA and English-Dialect phrase tables re-
spectively). As shown in Table 2, we observed a
similar outcome for the expanded lexicon results,
compared to baseline results, for MSA sentiment
classification. Though expansion had little effect
on classification, we believe that the expanded lex-
icon can help generalize the lexicon to new out-of-
domain data.
Tables 3 and 4 report subjectivity and sentiment
classification of Arabic tweets respectively. Lexi-
con expansion had some positive impact on subjec-
tivity classification with improvements in both accu-
racy, precision, and recall. Lexicon expansion had a
larger effect on sentiment classification for tweets
with improvement accuracy, precision, and recall
with improvements ranging between 1-3% (abso-
lute). The coverage of the lexicon increased nearly
4-folds compared to the baseline (19k matches for
baseline compared to 75k matches with expansion
for subjectivity, and 7k matches for baseline com-
pared to 28k matches with expansion for sentiment
classification). For both subjectivity and sentiment
classification, using the English-MSA phrase table
was better than using the English-Dialect phrase ta-
ble. This is not surprising given the large difference
in size between the two phrase tables.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we presented a strong baseline system
for performing SSA for Arabic news and tweets. In
our baseline, we employed stemming and POS tag-
ging, leading to results that surpass state-of-the-art
results for MSA news subjectivity classification. We
also introduced a new tweet corpus for SSA, which
we plan to release publicly. We also employed tweet
specific language processing to improve classifica-
tion. Beyond our baseline, we employed graph rein-
forcement based on random graph walks to expand
the SSA lexicon. The expanded lexicon had much
broader coverage than the original lexicon. This led
to improvements in both subjectivity and sentiment
classification for Arabic tweets.
For future work, we plan to explore other features
that may be more discriminative. We would like to
62
investigate automatic methods to increase the size
of SSA training data. This can be achieved by either
utilizing bootstrapping methods or applying MT on
large English tweets corpora. Another problem that
deserves thorough inspection is the identification of
polarity modifiers such as negation.
