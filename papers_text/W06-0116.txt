Abstract
We present a Chinese Named Entity
Recognition (NER) system submitted to
the close track of Sighan Bakeoff2006.
We define some additional features via do-
ing statistics in training corpus. Our sys-
tem incorporates basic features and addi-
tional features based on Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs). In order to correct in-
consistently results, we perform the post-
processing procedure according to n-best
results given by the CRFs model. Our fi-
nal system achieved a F-score of 85.14 at
MSRA, 89.03 at CityU, and 76.27 at LDC.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition task in the 2006 Sighan
Bakeoff includes three corpora: Microsoft Re-
search (MSRA), City University of Hong Kong
(CityU), and Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).
There are four types of Named Entities in the cor-
pora: Person Name, Organization Name, Location
Name, and Geopolitical Entity (only included in
LDC corpus).
We attend the close track of all three cor-
pora. In the close track, we can not use any
external resources. Thus except basic features,
we define some additional features by applying
statistics in training corpus to replace external re-
sources. Firstly, we perform word segmentation
using a simple left-to-right maximum matching al-
gorithm, in which we use a word dictionary gen-
erated by doing n-gram statistics. Then we de-
fine the features based on word boundaries. Sec-
ondly, we generate several lists according to the
relative position to Named Entity (NE). We de-
fine another type of features based on these lists.
Using these features, we build a Conditional Ran-
dom Fields(CRFs)-based Named Entity Recogni-
tion (NER) System. We use the system to generate
n-best results for every sentence, and then perform
a post-processing.
2 Conditional Random Fields
2.1 The model
Conditional Random Fields(CRFs), a statistical
sequence modeling framework, was first intro-
duced by Lafferty et alLafferty et al, 2001).
The model has been used for chunking(Sha and
Pereira, 2003). We only describe the model
briefly since full details are presented in the pa-
per(Lafferty et al, 2001).
In this paper, we regard Chinese NER as a se-
quence labeling problem. For our sequence label-
ing problem, we create a linear-chain CRFs based
on an undirected graph G = (V,E), where V is
the set of random variables Y = {Yi|1 ? i ? n},
for each of n tokens in an input sentence and
E = {(Yi?1, Yi)|1 ? i ? n} is the set of n ? 1
edges forming a linear chain. For each sentence x,
we define two non-negative factors:
exp(?Kk=1 ?kfk(yi?1, yi, x)) for each edge
exp(?K?k=1 ?
?
kf
?
k(yi, x)) for each node
where fk is a binary feature function, and K and
K ? are the number of features defined for edges
and nodes respectively. Following Lafferty et
al(Lafferty et al, 2001), the conditional probabil-
ity of a sequence of tags y given a sequence of
tokens x is:
P (y|x) = 1Z(x)exp(
?
i,k
?kfk(yi?1, yi, x) +

k(yi, x))

where Z(x) is the normalization constant. Given
the training data D, a set of sentences (characters

with their corresponding tags), the parameters of
the model are trained to maximize the conditional
log-likelihood. When testing, given a sentence x
in the test data, the tagging sequence y is given by
Argmaxy?P (y?|x).
CRFs allow us to utilize a large number of ob-
servation features as well as different state se-
quence based features and other features we want
to add.
2.2 CRFs for Chinese NER
Our CRFs-based system has a first-order Markov
dependency between NER tags.
In our experiments, we do not use feature selec-
tion and all features are used in training and test-
ing. We use the following feature functions:
f(yi?1, yi, x, i) = p(x, i)q(yi?1, yi) (2)
where p(x, i) is a predicate on the input sequence
x and current position i and q(yi?1, yi) is a predi-
cate on pairs of labels. For instance, p(x, i) might
be ?the char at position i is?(and)?.
In our system, we used CRF++ (V0.42)1 to im-
plement the CRFs model.
3 Chinese Named Entity Recognition
The training data format is similar to that of the
CoNLL NER task 2002, adapted for Chinese. The
data is presented in two-column format, where the
first column consists of the character and the sec-
ond is a tag.
Table 1 shows the types of Named Entities in the
data. Every character is to be tagged with a NE
type label extended with B (Beginning character
of a NE) and I (Non-beginning character of a NE),
or 0 (Not part of a NE).
To obtain a good-quality estimation of the con-
ditional probability of the event tag, the observa-
tions should be based on features that represent the
difference of the two events. In our system, we de-
fine three types of features for the CRFs model.
1CRF++ is available at
http://chasen.org/ taku/software/CRF++/
3.1 Basic Features
The basic features of our system list as follows:
? . Cn(n = ?2,?1, 0, 1, 2)
? . CnCn+1(n = ?1, 0)
Where C refers to a Chinese character while C0
denotes the current character and Cn(C?n) de-
notes the character n positions to the right (left)
of the current character.
For example, given a character sequence ???
????, when considering the character C0 de-
notes ???, C?1 denotes ???, C?1C0 denotes ??
??, and so on.
3.2 Word Boundary Features
The sentences in training data are based on char-
acters. However, there are many features related to
the words. For instance, the word ???? can be a
important feature for Person Name. We perform
word segmentation using the left-to-right maxi-
mum matching algorithm, in which we use a word
dictionary generated by doing n-gram statistics in
training corpus. Then we use the word boundary
tags as the features for the model.
Firstly, we construct a word dictionary by ex-
tracting N-grams from training corpus as follows:
1. Extract arbitrary N-grams (2 ? n ? 10,
Frequency ? 10 ) from training corpus. We
get a list W1.
2. Use a tool to perform statistical substring
reduction in W1[ described in (Lv et al,
2004)]2. We get a list W2.
3. Construct a character list (CH)3, in which the
characters are top 20 frequency in training
corpus.
4. Remove the strings from W2, which contain
the characters in the list CH. We get final N-
grams list W3.
Secondly, we use W3 as a dictionary for left-
to-right maximum matching word segmentation.
We assign word boundary tags to sentences. Each
character can be assigned one of 4 possible bound-
ary tags: ?B? for a character that begins a word
and is followed by another character, ?M? for a

character that occurs in the middle of a word, ?E?
for a character that ends a word, and ?S? for a char-
acter that occurs as a single-character word.
The word boundary features of our system list
as follows:
? . WTn(n = ?1, 0, 1)
Where WT refers to the word boundary tag while
WT0 denotes the tag of current character and
WTn(WT?n) denotes the tag n positions to the
right (left) of the current character.
3.3 Char Features
If we can use external resources, we often use the
lists of surname, suffix of named entity and prefix
of named entity for Chinese NER. In our system,
we generate these lists automatically from training
corpus by the procedure as follows:
? PSur: uni-gram characters, first characters of Person
Name. (surname)
? PC: uni-gram characters in Person Name.
? PPre: bi-gram characters before Person Name. (prefix
of Person Name)
? PSuf: bi-gram characters after Person Name. (suffix of
Person Name)
? LC: uni-gram characters in Location Name or Geopo-
litical entity.
? LSuf: uni-gram characters, the last characters of Loca-
tion Name or Geopolitical Entity. (suffix of Location
Name or Geopolitical Entity)
? OC: uni-gram characters in Organization Name.
? OSuf: uni-gram characters, the last characters of Orga-
nization Name. (suffix of Organization Name)
? OBSuf: bi-gram characters, the last two characters of
Organization Name. (suffix of Organization Name)
We remove the items in uni-gram lists if their fre-
quencies are less than 5 and in bi-gram lists if
their frequencies are less than 2. Based on these
lists, we assign the tags to every character. For in-
stance, if a character is included in PSur list, then
we assign a tag ?PSur 1?, otherwise assign a tag
?PSur 0?. Then we define the char features as fol-
lows:
? . PSur0PC0;
? . PSurnPCnPSurn+1PCn+1(n = ?1, 0);
? . PPre0;
? . PSuf0;
? . LC0OC0;
S is the list of sentences, S = {s1, s2, ..., sn}.
T is m-best results of S, T = {t1, t2, ..., tn}, which ti
is a set of m-best results of si.
pij is the score of tij , that is the jth result in ti.
Collect NE list:
Loop i in [1, n]
if(pi0 ? 0.5){
Exacting all NEs from ti0 to add into NEList.}
Replacing:
Loop i in [1, n]
if(pi0 ? 0.5){
FinalResult(si) = ti0.}
else{
TmpResult = ti0.
Loop j in [m, 1]
if(the NEs in tij is included in NEList){
Replace the matching string in TmpResult with new
NE tags.}
FinalResult(si) = TmpResult.
}

4 Post-Processing
There are inconsistently results, which are tagged
by the CRFs model. Thus we perform a post-
processing step to correct these errors.
The post-processing tries to assign the correct
tags according to n-best results for every sentence.
Our system outputs top 20 labeled sequences for
each sentence with the confident scores. The post-
processing algorithm is shown at Table 2. Firstly,
we collect NE list from high confident results.
Secondly, we re-assign the tags for low confident
results using the NE list.
5 Evaluation Results
5.1 Results on Sighan bakeoff 2006
We evaluated our system in the close track, on
all three corpora, namely Microsoft Research
(MSRA), City University of Hong Kong (CityU),
and Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Our offi-
cial Bakeoff results are shown at Table 3, where
the columns P, R, and FB1 show precision, recall
and F measure(? = 1). We used all three types of
features in our final system.
In order to evaluate the contribution of fea-
tures, we conducted the experiments of each type
of features using the test sets with gold-standard
dataset. Table 4 shows the experimental results,

The results indicated that word boundary fea-
tures helped on LDC and CityU, char features only
helped on CityU and the post-processing always
helped to improve the performance.
6 Conclusion
This paper presented our Named Entity Recogni-
tion system for the close track of Bakeoff2006.
Our approach was based on Conditional Random
Fields model. Except basic features, we defined
the additional features by doing statistics in train-
ing corpus. In addition, we performed a post-
processing according to n-best results generated
by the CRFs model. The evaluation results showed
that our system achieved state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on all three corpora in the close track.
