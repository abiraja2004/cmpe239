Performance evaluation in the field of natural language processing is 
generally recognised as being extremely complex. There are, so far, no 
pre-established criteria to deal x~th this problem. 
I. It is impossible to measure the merits of a grammar, seen as the 
component of an analyser, in absolute terms. An "ad hoc" grammar, constructed 
for a limited set of sentences is, without  doubt ,  more efficient in dealing with 
those particular sentences than a zrammer constructed for a larger set. 
Therefore, the  first rudimentary criterion, when evaluating the relation~hlp 
between a grammar and a set of sentences, should be to establish whether this 
grammar is capab le  of analysing these sentences. This is the determination of 
linguistic coverage, and necessitates the definition of the linguistic 
phenomena, independently of the linguistic theory which has been adopted to 
recognise these phenomena. 
2. In addition to its ability to recognise and coherently describe 
linguistic phenomena, a grammar should be Judged by its capacity to resolve 
ambiguity, to bypass irrelevant errors in the text being analysed, and so on. 
This aspect of a grammar could be regarded as its "robustness" \[P.Nayes, R.Reddy 
1979\]. 
3. Examining o ther  aspects  of the  prob lem,  in  the  ana lys i s  chat  we propose  we 
will assume a grammar which is capable of dealing with the texts which we will 
submit to it. 
Let an ATN grammar tl, vlth n nodes, be of this type. N will be maintained 
constant for the following discussion. 
BY text we intend a series of sentences, or of utterances by one of the 
speakers in a dialogue. When analysing such a text, once a constant N has been 
assumed, it is likely that, in addition to the content (the arglm~ent of the 
discourse) indications will appear on the grammatical choices made by the author 
of the text  (or the speaker) when expressing himself on that argument (how the 
argument  i s  expressed) .  
When these  ind icat ions  have been adequate ly  quant i f ied ,  they  can be used to 
cor rec t ly  se lec t  the  percept ive  s t ra teg ies  (as  de f ined  in  \ [Kaplan 72\] )  to be 
adopted in  order to achieve greater efficiency in the analysis of the following 
par t  of the  text. 
4. For our experiments we have used ATNSYS \[Stock 76\], and an Italian 
grammar with n - 50 (127 arcs) \[Cappelli st at.77\]. In this system, search is 
depth- f i r s t  and the parser Interacts with  a heuristic mechanism which 
orders  the arcs  accord ing  to a probab i l i ty  eva luat ion .  Th is  p robab i l i ty  
evaluation is dependent on the path which led to the current node and is also a 
funct ion  of the  s ta t i s t i ca l  data  accumulated  dur ing  prev ious  ana lyses  of a 
"coherent"  text .  
The mechanism can be divided into two stages. The first stage consists of the 
acquisition of statistical data; i.e, the frequency, for each arc exiting from a 
node,  of  the  passages  across  that  a rc ,  in re la t ion  to  the  arc  of a r r iva l :  fo r  
each ar r iv ing  arc  there  are  as many counters  as there  are  ex i t ing  arcs .

In  th i s  way, in  F ig .  I arc 1 has been crossed x t imes coming from a and y t imes 
coming from b. In the  second s tage ,  dur ing  pars ing ,  in s ta te  S, i f  coming from 
a and w > x, arc 2 is cried first.

4.1 Thus, a first evaluation of the linguistic choices made is provided by the 
set of probabil ity values assocla~ed to each arc. These figures can to some 
extent describe the "style" of any "coherent" text analysed. (For this one 
should also take into account the different l in~uistlc signif icance of each arc. 
In fact a CAT or PUSH arc directly corresponds to a certain linguistic 
component ,  while a JUMP or VIRT arc occurs in relation to the  techn ique  by which  
the network has been built, the linguistic theory adopted, and other variables.) 
4.2 The second par t  of the mechanism, ~he dynamic reordering of the  arcs, 
coincides with a reordering of the co~prehension strategies. In this way, a 
matr ix  can be assoc ia ted  to each  node ,  g iv ing  the  order  o f  the  s t ra teg ies  fo r  
each  arc  in arrival. 
For each text T, there is a set of strategies ~ ordered as describod above. 
While the analysis of the probabil ity values for distinct texts T and T" can 
give global indications of their lln~ulstlc characteristics, if we focus on ~he 
comprehension of the sentence, it is more meaningful to give nvaluatlons in 
relation to the sets of strategies, ~T and ~ , which are selected. 
Fig. 2 shows , for some nodes, a comparison between the orders of the  arcs for 
the first Ii sentences from two texts, a science fiction nnvel (SFN, upper 
boxes) and a handbook  of food chemistry (FC, lower boxes). The  arc  numbers are 
referred ~o the order in the original network. The figures which appear after 
the - in the heading indicate the number of parses for each sentence. An ec~cy 
box indicates the  same order as  that shown in the previous box.

5.1 It is to be expected that thls mechanism, in an far as it Intrnduces a 
heuristics, will increase the efficiency of the system used for the linguistic 
analysis. The  results of our experiments so far confirm this. This ir~roved 
efficiency can be measured in three ways: 
a) locally, in terms of the computational load, due to non-determinism, ~ ich  is 
saved in each node. In fact, by some experiments, it is possible to 
quantify the computational load of each type of arc. The computational load 
of a node is then a linear combination of these values and one can comgare it 
with the actual load determined by the sequence of arcs attempted in that 
po in t  after the reorder ing .  
b) in terms of an overall reduction in comput ing  t ime;  
C) in  te rms  o f  penet rance ,  i .e .  the  ra t io  between the  number  o f  cho ices  wh ich  
actually lead to a solution and the total number of choices wade. 
5.2 If T is a text containing r sentences, the average penetrance will be: 
o .=..', 
where  ~ s tands  fo r  each  o f  the  sentences  in  T .  
I f  T i s  ana lysed  us ing  the  set  o f  s t ra teg ies  chosen  fo r  a d i f fe rent  text ,  T ? ,  
then  the  penet rance  i s ,  on average ,  no greeter  than  with~ T ? 
114 
In our experiments, for instance, the avera~_e oenetrance for the first text 
(SFN) parsed with its own strategies (~s##) is ~ed,SFN)  = 0.52, while parsed 
with the strategies of the second text (Sty) is ~(5~,SFN) = 0.39. 
We have attempted to evaluate experlmentallv the relationship between the 
difference of the average penetrances, which we call dlscrepanc7 
and the distance between two sets of strategies. However we think we need more 
experimentation before formalizing this relationship. 
Returning to our science fiction novel, the discrenanc- using its set of 
strategies and the one inferred by the food chemistry text is 
6. In addition to the definition of a heuristic mechanism which is capable of 
i n~rov inE  the efficiency of natural l anguage process ing ,  and which can be 
evaluated as described above, our research aims at providing a means to 
chsracterise a text by evaluating the ~ramr~atical choices made by the author 
while expressing his argument. 
We are also attemptin~ to tako into account the expectations of the listener. 
In our opinion, the listener's expectations are not limited to the argument of 
the discourse but are also related to the way in which the argument is 
expressed; th i s  i s  the  equivalent of the cho ice  of a sdb-grammar \ [K i t t redge  7~\] 
We intend to verify the existence of such expectations not only in literature 
or x~hen listening to long speeches, but also in dialogue.
