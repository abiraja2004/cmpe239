Abstract 
Chinese named entity recognition is one 
of the difficult and challenging tasks of 
NLP. In this paper, we present a Chinese 
named entity recognition system using a 
multi-phase model. First, we segment the 
text with a character-level CRF model. 
Then we apply three word-level CRF 
models to the labeling person names, lo-
cation names and organization names in 
the segmentation results, respectively. 
Our systems participated in the NER tests 
on open and closed tracks of  Microsoft 
Research (MSRA). The actual evaluation 
results show that our system performs 
well on both the open tracks and closed 
tracks. 
1 Introduction 
Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamen-
tal component for many NLP applications, such 
as Information extraction, text Summarization, 
machine translation and so forth. In recent years, 
much attention has been focused on the problem 
of recognition of Chinese named entities. The 
problem of Chinese named entity recognition is 
difficult and challenging, In addition to the chal-
lenging difficulties existing in the counterpart 
problem in English, this problem also exhibits 
the following more difficulties: (1) In a Chinese 
document, the names do not have ?boundary to-
kens? such as the capitalized initial letters for a 
person name in an English document. (2) There 
is no space between words in Chinese text, so we 
have to segment the text before NER is per-
formed. 
In this paper, we report a Chinese named en-
tity recognition system using a multi-phase 
model which includes a basic segmentation 
phase and three named entity recognition phases. 
In our system, the implementations of basic seg-
mentation components and named entity recogni-
tion component are both based on conditional 
random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001). At 
last, we apply the rule method to recognize some 
simple and short location names and organization 
names in the text. We will describe each of these 
phases in more details below. 
2 Chinese NER with multi-level models 
2.1 Recognition Process 
The input to the recognition algorithm is Chinese 
character sequence that is not segmented and the 
output is recognized entity names. The process of 
recognition of Chinese NER is illustrated in fig-
ure 1. First, we segment the text with a character-
level CRF model. After basic segmentation, a 
small number of named entities in the text, such 
as ?????, ??????????? and so on, 
which are segmented as a single word. These 
simple single-word entities will be labeled with 
some rules in the last phase. However, a great 
number of named entities in the text, such as ??
???????????, ????????, are 
not yet segmented as a single word. Then, differ-
ent from (Andrew et al 2003), we apply three 
trained CRFs models with carefully designed and 
selected features to label person names, location 
names and organization names in the segmenta-
tion results, respectively. At last phase, we apply 
some rules to tag some names not recognized by 
CRFs models, and adjust part of the organization 
names recognized by CRFs models.

 2.2 Word segmentation 
We implemented the basic segmentation compo-
nent with linear chain structure CRFs. CRFs are  
undirected graphical models that encode a condi-
tional probability distribution using a given set of 
features. In the special case in which the desig-
nated output nodes of the graphical model are 
linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFs make a 
first-order Markov independence assumption 
among output nodes, and thus correspond to fi-
nite state machines (FSMs). CRFs define the 
conditional probability of a state sequence given 
an input sequence as

Where ),,,( 1 tossf ttk ?  is an arbitrary feature 
function over its arguments, and ?k is a learned 
weight for each feature function.  
Based on CRFs model, we cast the segmenta-
tion problem as a sequence tagging problem. Dif-
ferent from (Peng et al, 2004), we represent the 
positions of a hanzi (Chinese character) with four 
different tags: B for a hanzi that starts a word, I 
for a hanzi that continues the word, F for a hanzi 
that ends the word, S for a hanzi that occurs as a 
single-character word. The basic segmentation is 
a process of labeling each hanzi with a tag given 
the features derived from its surrounding context. 
The features used in our experiment can be bro-
ken into two categories: character features and 
word features. The character features are instan-
tiations of the following templates, similar to 
those described in (Ng and Jin, 2004), C refers to 
a Chinese hanzi. 
(a) Cn (n = ?2,?1,0,1,2 ) 
(b) CnCn+1( n = ?2,?1,0,1)  
(c) C?1C1 
(d) Pu(C0 ) 
In addition to the character features, we came 
up with another type word context feature which 
was found very useful in our experiments. The 
feature captures the relationship between the 
hanzi and the word which contains the hanzi. For 
a two-hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi 
??? within the word ???? will have the fea-
ture WC0=TWO_F set to 1, the second hanzi 
??? within the same word ???? will have the 
feature WC0=TWO_L set to 1. For the three-
hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi ??? 
within a word ????? will have the feature 
WC0=TRI_F set to 1, the second hanzi ??? 
within the same word ????? will have the 
feature WC0=TRI_M set to 1, and the last hanzi 
??? within the same word ????? will have 
the feature WC0=TRI_L set to 1. Similarly, the 
feature can be extended to a four-hanzi word. 
2.3 Named entity tagging with CRFs 
After basic segmentation, we use three word-
level CRFs models to label person names, loca-
tion names and organization names, respectively. 
The important factor in applying CRFs model to 
name entity recognition is how to select the 
proper features set. Most of entity names do not 
have any common structural characteristics ex-
cept for containing some feature words,  such as 
????, ????, ??? , ??? and so on. In addi-
tion, for person names, most names include a 
common surname, e.g. ???, ???. But as a 
proper noun, the occurrence of an entity name 
has the specific context. In this section, we only 
present our approach to organization name rec-
ognition. For example, the context information of 
organization name mainly includes the boundary 
words and some title words (e.g. ??????). 
By analyzing a large amount of entity name cor-
pora, we find that the indicative intensity of dif-
ferent boundary words vary greatly. So we divide 
the left and right boundary words into two 
classes according to the indicative intensity. Ac-
cordingly we construct the four boundary words 
lexicons. To solve the problem of the selection 
and classification of boundary words, we make 
use of mutual Information I(x, y). If there is a 
genuine association between x and y, then I(x, y) 
>>0. If there is no interesting relationship be-

tween x and y, then I(x, y)?0. If x and y are in 
complementary distribution, then I(x, y) << 0. 
By using mutual information, we compute the 
association between boundary word and the type 
of organization name, then select and classify the 
boundary words. Some example boundary words 
for organization names are listed in table 1. 
Table 1. The classified boundary words for ORG names 
Based on the consideration given in preceding 
section, we constructed a set of atomic feature 
patterns, listed in table 2. Additionally, we de-
fined a set of conjunctive feature patterns, which 
could form effective feature conjunctions to ex-
press complicated contextual information.

2.4 Processing with rules 
There exists some single-word named entities 
that aren?t tagged by CRFs models. We recog-
nize these single-word named entities with some 
rules. We first construct two known location 
names and organization names dictionaries and 
two feature words lists for location names and 
organization names. In closed track, we collect 
known location names and organization names 
only from training corpus. The recognition proc-
ess is described below. For each word in the text, 
we first check whether it is a known location or 
organization names according to the known loca-
tion names and organization names dictionaries. 
If it isn?t a known name, then we further check 
whether it is a known word. If it is not a known 
word also, we next check whether the word ends 
with a feature word of location or organization 
names. If it is, we label it as a location or organi-
zation name. 
In addition, we introduce some rules to adjust 
organization names recognized by CRF model 
based on the labeling specification of MRSA 
corpus. For example, the string ???????
???? ? is recognized as an organization 
name, but the string should be divided into two 
names: a location name (?????) and a or-
ganization name (?????????), according 
to label specification, so we add some rules to 
adjust it. 
3 Experimental results 
We participated in the three GB tracks in the 
third international Chinese language processing 
bakeoff: NER msra-closed, NER msra-open and 
WS msra-open. In the closed track, we con-
structed all dictionaries only with the words ap-
pearing in the training corpus. In the closed track, 
we didn?t use the same feature characters lists for 
location names and organization names as in the 
open tracks and we collected the feature charac-
ters from the training data in the closed track. We 
constructed feature characters lists for location 
names and organization names by the following 
approach. First, we extract all suffix string for all 
location names and organization names in the 
training data and count the occurrence of these 
suffix strings in all location names and organiza-
tion names. Second, we check every suffix string 
to judge whether it is a known word. If a suffix 
string is not a known word, we discard it. Finally, 
in the remaining suffix words, we select the fre-
quently used suffix words as the feature charac-
ters whose counts are greater than the threshold. 
We set different thresholds for single-character 
feature words and multi-character feature words. 
Similar approaches were taken to the collection 
of common Chinese surnames in the closed track.  
While making training data for segmentation 
model, we adopted different tagging methods for 
organization names in the closed track and in the 
open track. In the closed track, we regard every 
organization name, such as ????????
??, as a single word. But, in the open track, we 
segment a long organization name into several 
words. For example, the organization name ??
Type Class Examples
First-class ???6.0006?Left boundary 
word Second-class ???3.1161?
First -class ???5.4531?Right boundary 
word Second-class  ???2.0135?
215
???????? would be divided into three 
words: ?????, ???? and ?????. The 
different tagging methods at segmentation phase 
would bring different effect to organization 
names recognition. The size of training data used 
in the open tracks is same as the closed tracks. 
We have not employed any additional training 
data in the open tracks. Table 3 shows the per-
formance of our systems for NER in the bakeoff.

For the separate word segmentation task(WS), 
the above NER task is performed first. Then we 
added several additional processing steps on the 
result of named entity recognition. As we all 
know, disambiguation problem is one of the key 
issue in Chinese words segmentation. In this task, 
some ambiguities were resolved through a rule-
set which was automatically constructed based 
on error driven learning theory. The pre-
constructed rule-set stored many pseudo-
ambiguity strings and gave their correct segmen-
tations. After analyzing the result of our NER 
based on CRFs model, we noticed that it presents 
a high recall on out-of-vocabulary. But at the 
same time, some characters and words were 
wrongly combined as new words which caused 
the losing of the precision of OOV and the recall 
of IV. To this phenomenon, we adopted an un-
conditional rule, that if a word, except recog-
nized name entity, was detected as a new word 
and its length was more than 6 (Chinese Charac-
ters), and it should be segmented as several in-
vocabulary words based on the combination of  
FMM and BMM methods. Table 4 shows the 
result of our systems for word segmentation in 
the bakeoff.

4 Conclusion 
We have presented our Chinese named entity 
recognition system with a multi-phase model and 
its result for Msra_open and mrsa_closed tracks. 
Our open and closed GB track experiments show 
that its performance is competitive. We will try 
to select more useful feature functions into the 
existing segmentation model and named entity 
recognition model in future work.
