The f i r s t  a t tempts  to app ly  s ta t i s t i ca l  methods  in lex ico log ica l  research  are

i s  a l i s t  of words  in wh ich  every  word  car r ies  an ind icator  or  i t s  occurence  f requency  
in a text  of a cer ta in  length .  F requency  d ic t ionar ies  permi t  one to compare

of the text  w i th  regard  to i t s  re la t ion  to the vocabu lary .  
In the Ba l t i c  s ta tes  we f ind research  work  per ta in ing  to compi la t ion  of 
f requency  d ic t ionar ies .  In Ta l l in ,  Es ton ia ,  work  was  s tar ted  per ta in ing  to 
compi la t ion  of Russ ian  f requency  d ic t ionary  for  teach ing  purposes  ( 1960 ). 
The pro jec t  worked  on a number  of texts ,  am'oua\]ting to 400, 000 tokens .  The 
completed  d ic t ionary  revea ls  f requency  d i s t r ibut ions  accord ing  to word -c lasses ,  
government  of case  by verbs ,  p repos i t iona l  phrases  and a l so  the substant iva l  
cases .  
In o ther  Ba l t i c  S ta tes  we f ind l ingu is ts  engaged in s imi la r  fo rms  of s tudy  
on the word  leve l .  On the bas i s  of resu l t s  ga ined  f rom the s ta t i s t i ca l /worc l  
count of La tv ian  techn ica l - indust r ia l  texts ,  the f i r s t  vo lume (per ta in ing  to 
techn ica l  indust r ia l  f ie ld)  of a f requency  d ic t ionary  of La tv ian  language 
was  compi led  and pub l i shed  in t966.  
The s ta t i s t i ca l  approach  is  used  in the s tud ies  of s ty le .  The concept  
of "s ty le"  p resupposes  the presence  of severa l  p roper t ies  inherent  in a 
g iven  text  or texts  or  author ,  as  opposed to o thers .  One can propose  that  
s ty le  is  a sum of s ta t i s t i ca l  character i s t i cs  descr ib ing  the content  p roper t ies  of a 
par t i cu la r  text  as  d i s t inc t  f rom others .  
In the Ba l t i c  s ta tes  we f ind l ingu is ts  us ing  s ta t i s i ca l  methods  in the ana lys i s  
of s ty le .  In scann ing  some prose  texts  of La tv ian  wr i te r  B~aumanis ,  K. Karu l i s  
found that  words  that B laumanis  uses  in the d i rec t  speech  ~re shor ter  than those  in 
the ind i rec t  speech .
