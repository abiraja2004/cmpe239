Abstract
The GREC Task at REG?08 required partici-
pating systems to select coreference chains to
the main subject of short encyclopaedic texts
collected from Wikipedia. Three teams sub-
mitted a total of 6 systems, and we addition-
ally created four baseline systems. Systems
were tested automatically using a range of ex-
isting intrinsic metrics. We also evaluated
systems extrinsically by applying coreference
resolution tools to the outputs and measuring
the success of the tools. In addition, systems
were tested in a reading/comprehension exper-
iment involving human subjects. This report
describes the GREC Task and the evaluation
methods, gives brief descriptions of the par-
ticipating systems, and presents the evaluation
results.
1 Introduction
The GREC task is about how to generate appropri-
ate references to an entity in the context of a piece
of discourse longer than a sentence. Rather than
requiring participants to generate referring expres-
sions from scratch, the GREC data provides sets of
possible referring expressions for selection. As this
is a new referring expression generation (REG) task,
the shared task definition was kept fairly simple
and the aim for participating systems was to select
the appropriate type of referring expression (more
specifically, its REG08-TYPE, full details below).
The immediate motivating application context for
the GREC Task is the improvement of referential
clarity and coherence in extractive summarisation
by regenerating referring expressions in summaries.
There has recently been a small flurry of work in
this area (Steinberger et al, 2007; Nenkova, 2008).
In the longer term, the GREC Task is intended to be a
step in the direction of the more general task of gen-
erating referential expressions in discourse context.
The GREC Task Corpus is an extension of GREC
1.0 which had about 1,000 texts in the subdomains
of cities, countries, rivers and people (Belz and
Varges, 2007a). for the purpose of the REG?08 GREC
Task, we obtained an additional 1,000 texts in the
new subdomain of mountain texts and developed a
new XML annotation scheme (Section 2.2).
Five teams from four countries registered for the
GREC Task, of which three teams eventually submit-
ted 6 systems. We also used the corpus texts them-
selves as ?system? outputs, and created four base-
line systems. We evaluated the resulting 10 sys-
tems using a range of intrinsic and extrinsic evalu-
ation methods. This report presents the results of all
evaluations (Section 6), along with descriptions of
the GREC data and task (Section 2), test sets (Sec-
tion 3), evaluation methods (Section 4), and partici-
pating systems (Section 5).
2 Data and Task
The GREC Corpus (version 2.0) consists of about
2,000 texts in total, all collected from introductory
sections in Wikipedia articles, in five different do-
mains (cities, countries, rivers, people and moun-
tains). In each text, three broad categories of Main
Subject Reference (MSR)1 have been annotated, re-
1The main subject of a Wikipedia article is simply taken to
be given by its title, e.g. in the cities domain the main subject

sulting in a total of about 13,000 annotated REs.
The corpus was randomly divided into 90% train-
ing data (of which 10% were randomly selected as
development data) and 10% test data. Participants
used the training data in developing their systems,
and (as a minimum requirement) reported results on
the development data. Participants had 48 hours to
submit outputs for the (previously unseen) test data.
2.1 Types of referential expression annotated
Three broad categories of main subject referring ex-
pression (MSREs) are annotated in the GREC corpus2
? subject NPs, object NPs, and genitive NPs and pro-
nouns which function as subject-determiners within
their matrix NP. These categories of referring ex-
pression (RE) are relatively straightforward to iden-
tify and achieve high inter-annotator agreement on
(complete agreement among four annotators in 86%
of MSRs), and account for most cases of overt main
subject reference (MSR) in the GREC texts. The an-
notators were asked to identify subject, object and
genitive subject-determiners and decide whether or
not they refer to the main subject of the text. More
detail is provided in Belz and Varges (2007b).
In addition to the above, relative pronouns in sup-
plementary relative clauses (as opposed to integrated
relative clauses, Huddleston and Pullum, 2002, p.
1058) were annotated, e.g.:
(1) Stoichkov is a football manager and former striker who
was a member of the Bulgaria national team that
finished fourth at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.
We also annotated ?non-realised? subject MSREs
in a restricted set of cases of VP coordination where
an MSRE is the subject of the coordinated VPs, e.g.:
(2) He stated the first version of the Law of conservation of
mass, introduced the Metric system, and helped to
reform chemical nomenclature.
The motivation for annotating the approximate
place where the subject NP would be if it were re-
alised (the gap-like underscores above) is that from
a generation perspective there is a choice to be made
about whether to realise the subject NP in the second
and third coordinates or not.
(and title) of one text is London.
2In terminology and view of grammar the annotations rely
heavily on Huddleston and Pullum (2002).
2.2 XML format
Figure 1 is one of the texts distributed in the GREC
data sample for the REG Challenge. The REF el-
ement indicates a reference, in the sense of ?an
instance of referring? (which could, in principle,
be realised by gesture or graphically, as well as
by a string of words, or a combination of these).
REFs have three attributes: ID, a unique refer-
ence identifier; SEMCAT, the semantic category of
the referent, ranging over city, country, river,
person, mountain; and SYNCAT, the syntactic cat-
egory required of referential expressions for the ref-
erent in this discourse context (np-obj, np-subj,
subj-det). A REF is composed of one REFEX el-
ement (the ?selected? referential expression for the
given reference; in the corpus texts it is simply
the referential expression found in the corpus) and
one ALT-REFEX element which in turn is a list of
REFEXs which are alternative referential expressions
obtained by other means (see following section).
REFEX elements have four attributes. The
HEAD attribute has the possible values nominal,
pronoun, and rel-pron; the CASE attribute has
the possible values nominative, accusative and
genitive for pronouns, and plain and genitive
for nominals. The binary-valued EMPHATIC at-
tribute indicates whether the RE is emphatic; in the
present version of the GREC corpus, the only type of
RE that has this attribute is one which incorporates
a reflexive pronoun used emphatically (e.g. India it-
self ). The REG08-TYPE attribute indicates basic RE
type as required for the REG?08 GREC task defini-
tion. The choice of types is motivated by the hy-
pothesis that one of the most basic decisions to be
taken in RE selection for named entities is whether to
use an RE that includes a name, such as Modern In-
dia (the corresponding REG08-TYPE value is name);
whether to go for a common-noun RE, i.e. with a
category noun like country as the head (common);
whether to pronominalise the RE (pronoun); or
whether it can be left unrealised (empty).
2.3 The REG?08 GREC Task
The task for participating systems was to develop
a method for selecting one of the REFEXs in the
ALT-REFEX list, for each REF in each TEXT in the
test sets. The test data inputs were identical to the

training/development data, except that REF elements
contained only an ALT-REFEX list, not the preced-
ing ?selected? REFEX. ALT-REFEX lists are gener-
ated for each text by an automatic method which
collects all the (manually annotated) MSREs in a text
including the title and adds several defaults: pro-
nouns and reflexive pronouns in all subdomains; and
category nouns (e.g. the river), in all subdomains
except people. The main objective in the REG?08
GREC Task was to get the REG08-TYPE attribute of
REFEXs right.
3 Test Data
1. GREC Test Set C-1: a randomly selected 10%
subset (183 texts) of the GREC corpus (with the same
proportions of texts in the 5 subdomains as in the
training/testing data).
2. GREC Test Set C-2: the same subset of texts as
in C-1; however, for C-2 we did not use the MSREs
in the corpus, but replaced each of them with three
human-selected alternatives. These were obtained in
an online experiment as described in Belz & Varges
(2007a) where subjects selected MSREs in a setting
that duplicated the conditions in which the partici-
pating systems in the REG?08 GREC Task made se-
lections.3 We obtained three versions of each text,
where in each version all MSREs were selected by
the same person. The motivation for creating this
version of Test Set C was firstly that having sev-
eral human-produced chains of MSREs to compare
the outputs of participating (?peer?) systems against
is more reliable than having one only; and secondly
that Wikipedia texts are edited by multiple authors
and so MSR chains may sometimes be adversely af-
fected by this; we wanted to have additional refer-
ence texts without this characteristic.
3. GREC Test Set L: 74 Wikipedia introductory
texts from the subdomain of lakes; participants did
not know what this subdomain was until they re-
ceived the test data (there were no lake texts in the
training/development set).
4. GREC Test Set P: 31 short encyclopaedic texts
in the same 5 subdomains as in the GREC corpus,
in approximately the same proportions as in the
training/testing data, but from a source other than

Wikipedia. We transcribed these texts from printed
encyclopaedias published in the 1980s which are
not available in electronic form, and this provenance
was not revealed to participants. The texts in this set
are much shorter and more homogeneous than the
Wikipedia texts, and the sequences of MSRs follow
very similar patterns. It seems likely that it is these
properties that have resulted in better scores overall
for Test Set P (see Section 6).
Each test set was designed to test peer systems for
a different aspect of generalisation. Test Set C tests
for generalisation to unseen material from the same
corpus and the same subdomains as the training set;
Test Set L tests for generalisation to unseen material
from the same corpus but different subdomain; and
Test Set P tests generalisation to a different corpus
but same subdomains.
4 Evaluation methods
4.1 Automatic intrinsic evaluations
Accuracy of REG08-Type: when computed against
the single-RE test sets (C-1, L and P), REG08-Type
Accuracy is the proportion of REFEXs selected by a
participating system that have a REG08-TYPE value
identical to the one in the corpus.
When computed against the triple-RE test set (C-
2), first the number of correct REG08-Types is com-
puted at the text level for each of the three ver-
sions of a corpus text and the maximum of these
is determined; then the maximum text-level num-
bers are summed and divided by the total number of
REFs in all the texts, which gives the global REG08-
Type Accuracy score. The rationale behind com-
puting the REG08-Type Accuracy scores in this way
for multiple-RE test sets (maximising scores on RE
chains rather than individual REs) is that an RE is
not good or bad in its own right, but depends on the
other MSRs in the same text.4
String Accuracy: This is defined just like
REG08-Type Accuracy, except here what is deter-
mined is identity between REFEX word strings (the
MSREs themselves), not between REG08-Types.
String-edit distance metrics: String-edit dis-
tance (SE) is straightforward Levenshtein distance
with a substitution cost of 2 and insertion/deletion
4This definition is also slightly different from the one given
in the Participants? Pack.
cost of 1. We also used the version of string-edit
distance described by Bangalore et al (2000) which
normalises for length. This version is denoted ?SEB?
below. For the single-RE test sets, the global score
is simply the average of all RE-level scores. For Test
Set C-2, we used an approach analogous to that de-
scribed above for REG08-Type Accuracy. We first
computed the best string-edit distance at the text
level (here, just the sum of RE-level distances) and
then obtained the global distance by dividing the
sum of best text-level distances by the number of
REFs in all the texts.
Other metrics: BLEU is a precision metric from
MT that assesses the quality of a peer translation
in terms of the proportion of its word n-grams
(n ? 4 is standard) that it shares with several ref-
erence translations. We used BLEU-3 rather than
the more standard BLEU-4 because most REs in the
corpus are less than 4 tokens long. We also used
the NIST version of BLEU which weights in favour
of less frequent n-grams, as well as ROUGE-2 and
ROUGE-SU4 (the two official automatic scores from
the DUC summarisation competitions). In all cases,
we assessed just the MSREs selected by peer systems
(leaving out the surrounding text), and computed
scores globally (rather than averaging over RE-level
scores), as this is standard for these metrics.
BLEU, NIST and ROUGE are designed to work
with either one or multiple reference texts, so we did
not need to use a different method for Test Set C-2.
4.2 Human extrinsic evaluation
We designed a reading/comprehension experiment
in which the task for subjects was to read texts
one sentence at a time and then to answer three
brief multiple-choice comprehension questions after
reading each text. The basic idea was that it seemed
likely that badly chosen MSR reference chains would
adversely affect ease of comprehension, and that this
might in turn affect reading speed and accuracy in
answering comprehension questions.
We used a randomly selected subset of 21 texts
from Test Set C, and recruited 21 subjects from
among the staff, faculty and students of Brighton
and Sussex universities. We used a Repeated Latin
Squares design in which each combination of text
and system was allocated three trials. During the
experiment we recorded SRTime, the time subjects
186
took to read sentences (from the point when the sen-
tence appeared on the screen to the point at which
the subject requested the next sentence).
We also recorded the speed and accuracy with
which subjects answered the questions at the end (Q-
Time and Q-Acc). The role of the comprehension
questions was to encourage subjects to read the texts
properly, rather than skimming through them, and
we did not necessarily expect any significant results
from the associated measures.
The questions were designed to be of varying de-
grees of difficulty and predictability. There was one
set of three questions (each with five possible an-
swers) associated with each text, and questions fol-
lowed the same pattern across the texts: the first
question was always about the subdomain of a text;
the second about the location of the main subject; the
third question was designed not to be predictable.
The order of the answers was randomised for each
question and each subject. The order of texts (with
associated questions) was randomised for each sub-
ject. We used the DMDX package for presentation
of sentences and measuring reading times and ques-
tion answering accuracy (Forster and Forster, 2003).
Subjects did the experiment in a quiet room, under
supervision.
4.3 Automatic extrinsic evaluation
As a new and highly experimental method, we tried
out an automatic approach to extrinsic evaluation.
The basic idea was similar to that in the human-
based experiments described above: badly chosen
reference chains seem likely to affect the reader?s
ability to resolve REs. In the automatic version, the
role of the reader is played by an automatic coref-
erence resolution tool and the expectation is that the
tool performs worse (are less able to identify coref-
erence chains correctly) with worse MSR reference
chains.
To counteract the potential problem of results be-
ing a function of a specific coreference resolution
algorithm or tool, we decided to use three differ-
ent resolvers?those included in LingPipe,5 JavaRap
(Qiu et al, 2004) and OpenNLP (Morton, 2005)?
and to average results.
There does not appear to be a single standard eval-
5http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/
uation metric in the coreference resolution commu-
nity, so we opted to use three: MUC-6 (Vilain et al,
1995), CEAF (Luo, 2005), and B-CUBED (Bagga and
Baldwin, 1998), which seem to be the most widely
accepted metrics.
All three metrics compute Recall, Precision and
F-Scores on aligned gold-standard and resolver-tool
coreference chains. They differ in how the align-
ment is obtained and what components of corefer-
ence chains are counted for calculating scores. Re-
sults for the automatic extrinsic evaluations are re-
ported below in terms of the F-Scores from these
three metrics, as well as in terms of their average.
5 Systems
Base-rand, Base-freq, Base-1st, Base-name: We
created four baseline systems. Base-rand selects
one of the REFEXs at random. Base-freq selects
the REFEX that is the overall most frequent given
the SYNCAT and SEMCAT of the reference. Base-
1st always selects the REFEX which appears first
in the list of REFEXs; and Base-name selects the
shortest REFEX with attributes REG08-TYPE=name,
HEAD=nominal and EMPHATIC=no.6
CNTS-Type-g, CNTS-Prop-s: The CNTS sys-
tems are trained using memory-based learning with
automatic parameter optimisation. They use a set of
14 features obtained by various kinds of syntactic
preprocessing and named-entity recognition as well
as from the corpus annotations: SEMCAT, SYNCAT,
position of RE in text, neighbouring words and POS-
tags, distance to previous mention, SYNCATs of
three preceding REFEXs, binary feature indicating
whether the most recent named entity was the main
subject (MS), main verb of the sentence. For Type-
g, a single classifier was trained to predict just the
REG08-TYPE property of REFEXs. For Prop-s, four
classifiers were trained, one for each subdomain, to
predict all four properties of REFEXs (rather than just
REG08-TYPE).
OSU-b-all, OSU-b-nonRE, OSU-n-nonRE: The
OSU-2 systems are maximum-entropy classifiers
trained on a range of features obtained by prepro-
6Attributes are tried in this order. If for one attribute, the
right value is not found, the process ignores that attribute and
moves on the next one.

tron which uses four features obtained by prepro-

REG08-TYPE of preceding reference to the MS, fea-
ture indicating whether the preceding MSR is in the
same sentence.
6 Results
This section presents the results of all the evalua-
tion methods described in Section 4. We start with
REG08-Type Accuracy, an intrinsic automatic met-
ric which participating teams were told was going
to be the chief evaluation method, followed by other
intrinsic automatic metrics (Section 6.2), the extrin-
sic human evaluation (Section 6.3) and the extrinsic
automatic evaluation (Section 6.4).
6.1 REG08-Type Accuracy
Participants computed REG08-Type Accuracy for
the development set (97 texts) themselves, using a
tool provided by us. These scores are shown in
Table 1, and are also included in the participants?
reports elsewhere in this volume. Systems are or-
dered in terms of their overall REG08-Type Accu-
racy (column 1), and scores for each subdomain are
also shown. Scores are highly consistent across the
subdomains, except for the river subdomain which
was the smallest set (containing only 4 texts), and
results for it may be idiosyncratic for this reason.
Corresponding results for the (unseen) test set C-1
are shown in column 2 of Table 2. As would be ex-
pected, results are slightly worse than for the (seen)
development set (although some systems managed
to improve over their development set scores). Also
included in this table are results for the four base-
line systems, and it is clear that selecting the most
frequent REG08-Type given SEMCAT and SYNCAT
(as done by the Base-freq system) provides a strong
baseline.
Other columns in Table 2 contain results for test
sets L and P. Again as expected, results for Test Set
L are lower than for Test Set C-1, because in ad-
dition to consisting of unseen texts (like C-1), Test
Set L is also from an unseen subdomain (unlike C-
1). The results for Test Set P are higher and on a par
with those for the development set, probably for the
reasons discussed at the end of Section 3.
For each test set in Table 2 we carried out a uni-
variate ANOVA with System as the fixed factor. We
found significant main effects at p < .001 in all
three cases (C-1: F = 95.426; L: F = 63.758;
P: F = 21.188). The columns containing capital
letters in Table 2 show the homogeneous subsets of
systems as determined by post-hoc Tukey HSD com-
parisons of means. Systems whose REG08-Type Ac-
curacy scores are not significantly different (at the
.05 level) share a letter.
The results for REG08-Type Accuracy computed
against the triple-RE Test Set C-2 are shown in Ta-
ble 3. These should be considered as the chief results
of the GREC Task evaluations, as stated in the guide-
lines. Here too we performed a univariate ANOVA
with System as the fixed factor and REG08-Type
as the dependent variable. Having established by
ANOVA that there was a significant main effect of
System (F = 86.946, p < .001), we compared the
mean scores with Tukey?s HSD. As can be seen from
the resulting homogeneous subsets, there is no sig-
nificant difference between the corpus texts (C-1)
and system CNTS-Type-g, but also there is no sig-

CNTS-Prop-s, IS-G and OSU-n-nonRE. In this anal-
ysis, all systems outperform the random baseline;
all peer systems outperform all of the baselines; and
the four best peer systems outperform the remaining
two.
6.2 Other automatic intrinsic metrics
In addition to the chief evaluation measure reported
on in the preceding section, we computed the string
similarity metrics described in Section 4.1 for all
four test sets. Results were very similar to those
for REG08-Type Accuracy, so we are reporting only
scores for Test Set C-2 (Table 4). The corpus texts
again receive the best scores across the board (SE is
the odd one out, because here lower scores are bet-
ter). Ranks for peer systems are very similar to the
results reported in the last section.
We performed an ANOVA (F = 138.159, p <
.001) and Tukey HSD post-hoc analysis for String
Accuracy. The resulting homogeneous subsets (Ta-
ble 4, columns 3?8) reveal significant differences
similar to those for REG08-Type Accuracy. We also
computed Pearson product-moment correlation co-
efficients between all automatic intrinsic evaluation
measures we used. All pairwise correlations were
significant at the .01 level (using a two-tailed test).
One of the strongest correlations (.961) was between
REG08-Type Accuracy and String Accuracy, imply-
ing that getting REG08-Type right gets you some
way towards getting the actual RE right.
6.3 Human-based extrinsic measures
As a result of the experiment described in Sec-
tion 4.2 we had SRTime measures (sentence reading
times) for each sentence in each of the 21 texts that
were included in the experiment. Table 5 shows the
resulting SRTimes in milliseconds averaged per sys-
tem. None of the differences were statistically sig-
nificant. We also analysed SRTimes normalised by
sentence length; SRTimes only from sentences that
contained MRSs; and SRTimes normalised for sub-
ject reading speed. There were no significant differ-
ences under any of these analyses.
Much of the variance in SRTimes was due to sub-
jects? very different average reading speeds: means
of SRTime normalised for sentence length ranged
from 188.45ms to 426.10ms for individual subjects.

There was also variance from Text, i.e. some of the
texts appear to be harder to read than others.
The other two measures from the task-
performance experiment were Q-Acc (question
answering accuracy) and Q-Time (question answer-
ing speed). ANOVAs revealed no significant main
effect of System on Q-Time. For Q-Acc, we looked
at each of the three question types Q1, Q2, Q3
(see Section 4.2) separately. ANOVAs showed no
significant effect of System on Q-Acc for Q2 and
Q3; there was a slight effect (F = 2.193, p < .05)
of System on Q-Acc for Q1 (the easiest of the
questions which simply asked for the subdomain
of a text). Table 6 shows Q-Acc for Q1 and Q2,
and the results of a post-hoc analysis (Tukey HSD)
which revealed two homogeneous subsets with a lot
of overlap (columns 2 and 3).

coreference resolvers, and computed average MUC,
CEAF and B-CUBED F-Scores as described in Sec-
tion 4.3. The second column Table 7 shows the av-
erage of these three F-Scores, to give a single over-
all result for this evaluation method. A univariate
ANOVA with the average F-Score (column 2) as the
dependent variable and System as the single fixed
factor revealed a significant main effect of System
on average F-Score (F = 5.051, p < .001). A
post-hoc comparison of the means (Tukey HSD, al-
pha = .05) found the significant differences indi-
cated by the homogeneous subsets in columns 3?
5 (Table 7). The numbers shown in the last three
columns are the separate MUC, CEAF and B-CUBED
F-Scores for each system, averaged over the three
resolver tools. ANOVAs revealed the following ef-
fects of System: on CEAF F = 9.984, p < .001;
on MUC: F = 10.07, p < .001; on B-CUBED:
F = 8.446, p < .001.
The three F-Score measures (MUC, CEAF and B-
CUBED) are all strongly and highly significantly cor-
190
related: Pearson?s correlation coefficient is .947 for
B-CUBED and CEAF, .917 for B-CUBED and MUC,
and .951 for CEAF and MUC (p < .01, 2-tailed).

7 Concluding Remarks
The GREC Task is a new task not only for an NLG
shared-task challenge, but also as a research task in
general (improving referential clarity in extractive
summaries seems to be just taking off as a research
subfield). It was therefore not unexpected that only
three teams were able to participate in this task.
We continued the traditions of the ASGRE?07
Challenge in that we used a wide range of evalu-
ation metrics to obtain a well-rounded view of the
quality of the participating systems. It had been our
intention to use evaluation methods in all four possi-
ble extrinsic/intrinsic and automatic/human combi-
nations. However, the combination intrinsic/human
is missing from this report and will have to be left to
future research.
There was no indication in the human task perfor-
mance experiment that the different reference chains
selected by different systems had any impact on sub-
jects? reading speeds, and the evidence that there
is an effect on comprehension was scant. This
means that we will need to investigate alternative
task-performance measures. Because of the lack of
significant results from the human extrinsic experi-
ment, we were also unable to validate the automatic
extrinsic experiment against it, and so at this point
we do not really know how useful it is (despite some
correlation with intrinsic measures), something we
will seek to establish in future research.
