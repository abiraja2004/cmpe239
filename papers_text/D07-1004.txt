Abstract
Previous machine learning techniques for
answer selection in question answering
(QA) have required question-answer train-
ing pairs. It has been too expensive and
labor-intensive, however, to collect these
training pairs. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised support vector machine (U-
SVM) classifier for answer selection, which
is independent of language and does not re-
quire hand-tagged training pairs. The key
ideas are the following: 1. unsupervised
learning of training data for the classifier by
clustering web search results; and 2. select-
ing the correct answer from the candidates
by classifying the question. The compara-
tive experiments demonstrate that the pro-
posed approach significantly outperforms
the retrieval-based model (Retrieval-M), the
supervised SVM classifier (S-SVM), and the
pattern-based model (Pattern-M) for answer
selection. Moreover, the cross-model com-
parison showed that the performance rank-
ing of these models was: U-SVM > Pattern-
M > S-SVM > Retrieval-M.
1 Introduction
The purpose of answer selection in QA is to se-
lect the exact answer to the question from the ex-
tracted candidate answers. In recent years, many
supervised machine learning techniques for answer
selection in open-domain question answering have
been investigated in some pioneering studies [Itty-
cheriah et al 2001; Ng et al 2001; Suzuki et al
2002; Sasaki, et al 2005; and Echihabi et al 2003].
Compared with retrieval-based [Yang et al 2003],
pattern-based [Ravichandran et al 2002 and Soub-
botin et al 2002], and deep NLP-based [Moldovan
et al 2002, Hovy et al 2001; and Pasca et al 2001]
answer selection, machine learning techniques are
more effective in constructing QA components from
scratch. These techniques suffer, however, from the
problem of requiring an adequate number of hand-
tagged question-answer training pairs. It is too ex-
pensive and labor intensive to collect such training
pairs for supervised machine learning techniques.
To tackle this knowledge acquisition bottleneck,
this paper presents an unsupervised SVM classifier
for answer selection, which is independent of lan-
guage and question type, and avoids the need for
hand-tagged question-answer pairs. The key ideas
are as follows:
1. Regarding answer selection as a kind of classi-
fication task and adopting an SVM classifier;
2. Applying unsupervised learning of pseudo-
training data for the SVM classifier by cluster-
ing web search results;
3. Training the SVM classifier by using three
types of features extracted from the pseudo-
training data; and
4. Selecting the correct answer from the candidate
answers by classifying the question. Note that
this means classifying a question into one of
the clusters learned by clustering web search
results. Therefore, our classifying the question
33
Figure 1: Web Question Answering Architecture
is different from conventional question classifi-
cation (QC) [Li et al 2002] that determines the
answer type of the question.
The proposed approach is fully unsupervised and
starts only from a user question. It does not require
richly annotated corpora or any deep linguistic tools.
To the best of our knowledge, no research on this
kind of study we discuss here has been reported.
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of our web QA
approach. The S-SVM and Pattern-M models are
included for comparison.
Because the focus of this paper just evaluates the
answer selection part, our approach requires knowl-
edge of the answer type to the question in order to
find candidate answers, and that the answer must be
a NE for convenience in candidate extraction. Ex-
periments using Chinese versions of the TREC 2004
and 2005 test data sets show that our approach sig-
nificantly outperforms the S-SVM for answer selec-
tion, with a top 1 score improvement of more than
20%. Results obtained with the test data set in [Wu
et al 2004] show that the U-SVM increases the
top 1/mrr 5/top 5 scores by 5.95%/6.06%/8.68%
as compared with the Pattern-M. Moreover, our
cross-model comparison demonstrates that the per-
formance ranking of all models considered is: U-
SVM > Pattern-M > S-SVM > Retrieval-M.
2 Comparison among Models
Related researches on answer selection in QA can be
classified into four categories. The retrieval-based
model [Yang et al 2003] selects a correct answer
from the candidates according to the distance be-
tween a candidate and all question keywords. This
model does not work, however, if the question and
the answer-bearing sentences do not match on the
surface. The pattern-based model [Ravichandran
et al 2002 and Soubbotin et al 2002] first clas-
sifies the question into predefined categories, and
then extracts the exact answer by using answer pat-
terns learned off-line. Although the pattern-based
model can obtain high precision for some prede-
fined types of questions, it is difficult to define ques-
tion types in advance for open-domain question an-
swering. Furthermore, this model is not suitable for
all types of questions. The deep NLP-based model
[Moldovan et al 2002; Hovy et al 2001; and Pasca
et al 2001] usually parses the user question and an
answer-bearing sentence into a semantic represen-
tation, and then semantically matches them to find
the answer. This model has performed very well at
TREC workshops, but it heavily depends on high-
performance NLP tools, which are time consuming
and labor intensive for many languages. Finally, the
machine learning-based model has also been inves-
tigated. current models of this type are based on su-
pervised approaches [Ittycheriah et al 2001; Ng et
al. 2001; Suzuki et al 2002; and Sasaki et al 2005]
that are heavily dependent on hand-tagged question-
answer training pairs, which not readily available.
In response to this situation, this paper presents
the U-SVM for answer selection in open-domain
web question answering system. Our U-SVM has
the following advantages over supervised machine
learning techniques. First, the U-SVM classifies
questions into a question-dependent set of clusters,
and the answer is the name of a question cluster.
In contrast, most previous models have classified
candidates into positive and negative. Second, the
U-SVM automatically learns the unique question-
dependent clusters and the pseudo-training for each

question. This differs from the supervised tech-
niques, in which a large number of hand-tagged
training pairs are shared by all of the test ques-
tions. In addition, supervised techniques indepen-
dently process the answer-bearing sentences, so the
answers to the questions may not always be ex-
tractable because of algorithmic limitations. On the
other hand, the U-SVM can use the interdependence
between answer-bearing sentences to select the an-
swer to a question.
Table 1 compares the key idea and training data
used in the U-SVM with those used in the supervised
machine learning techniques. Here, ME means the
maximum entropy model, and N-C means the noisy-
channel model.
3 The U-SVM
The essence of the U-SVM is to regard answer selec-
tion as a kind of text categorization-like classifica-
tion task, but with no training data available. In the
U-SVM, the steps of ?clustering web search results?,
?classifying the question?, and ?training SVM clas-
sifier? play very important roles.
3.1 Clustering Web Search Results
Web search results, such as snippets returned by
Google, usually include a mixture of multiple
subtopics (called clusters in this paper) related to
the user question. To group the web search results
into clusters, we assume that the candidate answer in
each Google snippet can represent the ?signature? of
its cluster. In other words, the Google snippets con-
taining the same candidate are regarded as aligned
snippets, and thus belong to the same cluster. Web
search results are clustered in two phases.
? A first-stage Google search (FGS) is ap-
plied to extract n candidate answers
{c1, c2, . . . , cn} from the top m Google
snippets {s1, s2, . . . , sm} by a NER tool
[Wu et al 2005]. Those snippets containing
the candidates {ci} and at least one ques-
tion keyword {qi} are retained. Finally,
the retained snippets {s1, s2, . . . , sm} are
clustered into n clusters {C1, C2, . . . , Cn}
by clustering web search results, that is,
If a snippet includes L different candidates,
the snippet belongs to L different clusters.
If the candidates of different snippets are
the same, these snippets belong to the same
clusters.
Consequently, the number of clusters {Ci} is
fully determined by the number of candidates
{ci}, and the cluster name of a cluster Ci is the
candidate answer ci. Up to this point, we have
obtained clusters and sample snippets for each
cluster that will be used as training data for the
SVM classifier. Because this training data is
learned automatically, rather than hand-tagged,
we call it pseudo-training data.
? A second-stage Google search (SGS) is ap-
plied to resolve data sparseness in the pseudo-
training samples learned through the FGS. The
FGS data may have very few training snip-
pets in some clusters, so more snippets must
be collected. Note that this step just learns new
35
Google snippets into the clusters learned by the
FGS, but does not add new clusters.
For each candidate answer ci:
Combine the original query q = {qi} and
the candidate ci to form a new query q? =
{q, ci}.
Submit q? to Google and download the top
50 Google snippets.
Retain the snippets containing the candi-
date ci and at least one keyword qi.
Group the retained snippets into n clusters
to form the new pseudo-training data.
End
Here, we give an example illustrating the prin-
ciple of clustering web search results in the
FGS. In submitting TREC 2004 test question 1.1
?when was the first Crip gang started?? to Google
(http://www.google.com/apis), we extract n(= 8)
different candidates from the top m(= 30) Google
snippets. The Google snippets containing the same
candidates are aligned snippets, and thus the 12 re-
tained snippets are grouped into 8 clusters, as listed
in Table 2. This table roughly indicates that the snip-
pets with the same candidate answers contain the
same sub-meanings, so these snippets are considered
as aligned snippets. For example, all Google snip-
pets that contain the candidate answer 1969 express
the time of establishment of ?the first Crip gang?.
In summary, the U-SVM uses the result of ?clus-
tering web search results? as the pseudo-training
data of the SVM classifier, and then classifies user
question into one of the clusters for answer selec-
tion. On the one hand, the clusters and their names
are based on candidate answers to question; on the
other hand, candidates are dependent on question.
Therefore, the clusters are question-dependent.
3.2 Classifying Question
Using the pseudo-training data obtained by cluster-
ing web search results to train the SVM classifier,
we classify user questions into a set of question-
dependent clusters and assume that the correct an-
swer is the name of the question cluster that is as-
signed by the trained U-SVM classifier. For the
above example, if the U-SVM classifier, trained on
the pseudo-training data listed in Table 2, classifies
the above test question into a cluster whose name is
1969, then the cluster name 1969 is the answer to
the question.
This paper selects LIBSVM toolkit1 to implement
the SVM classifier. The kernel is the radical basis
function with the parameter ? = 0.001 in the exper-
iments.
3.3 Feature Extraction
To classify the question into a question-dependent
set of clusters, the U-SVM classifier extracts three
types of features.
? A similarity-based feature set (SBFS) is
extracted from the Google snippets. The SBFS
attempts to capture the word overlap between
a question and a snippet. The possible values
range from 0 to 1.
SBFS Features
percentage of matched keywords (KWs)
percentage of mismatched KWs
percentage of matched bi-grams of KWs
percentage of matched thesauruses
normalized distance between candidate and
KWs
To compute the matched thesaurus feature, we
adopt TONGYICICILIN 2 in the experiments.
? A Boolean match-based feature set (BMFS) is
also extracted from the Google snippets. The
BMFS attempts to capture the specific key-
word Boolean matches between a question and
a snippet. The possible values are true or false.
BMFS Features
person names are matched or not
location names are matched or not
organization names are matched or not
time words are matched or not
number words are matched or not
root verb is matched or not
candidate has or does not have bi-gram in
snippet matching bi-gram in question
candidate has or does not have desired
named entity type
? A window-based word feature set (WWFS)
is a set of words consisting of the words

preceding {wi?5, . . . , wi?1} and following
{wi+1, . . . , wi+5} the candidate answer. The
WWFS features can be regarded as a kind of
relevant snippets-based question keywords ex-
pansion. By extracting the WWFS feature set,
the feature space in the U-SVM becomes ques-
tion dependent, which may be more suitable for
classifying the question. The number of classi-
fication features in the S-SVM must be fixed,
however, because all questions share the same
training data. This is one difference between
the U-SVM and the supervised SVM classifier
for answer selection. Each word feature in the
WWFS is weighted using its ISF value.
ISF (wj , Ci) =
N(wj , Ci) + 0.5
N(wj) + 0.5
(1)
where N(wj) is the total number of the
snippets containing word feature wj , and
N(wj , Ci) is the number of snippets in cluster
Ci containing word feature wj .
When constructing question vector, we assume
that the question is an ideal question that con-
tains all the extracted WWFS words. There-
fore, the values of the WWFS word features in
question vector are 1. Similarly, the values of
the SBFS and BMFS features in question vec-
tor are also estimated by self-similarity calcu-
lation.
4 Experiments
4.1 Data Sets
For the experiments, no English named entity recog-
nition (NER) tool is in our hand at the time of
the experiments; therefore, we validate the U-SVM
37
in terms of Chinese web QA using three test data
sets, which will be published with this paper3. Al-
though the U-SVM is independent of the question
types, for convenience in candidate extraction, only
those questions whose answers are named entities
are selected. The three test data sets are CTREC04,
CTREC05 and CTEST05. CTREC04 is a set of
178 Chinese questions translated from TREC 2004
FACTOID testing questions. CTREC05 is a set of
279 Chinese questions translated from TREC 2005
FACTOID testing questions. CTEST05 is a set of
178 Chinese questions found in [Wu et al 2004]
that are similar to TREC testing questions except
that they are written in Chinese. Figure 2 breaks
down the types of questions (manually assigned) in
the CTREC04 and CTREC05 data sets. Here, PER,
LOC, ORG, TIM, NUM, and CR refer to questions
whose answers are a person, location, organization,
time, number, and book or movie, respectively.
Figure 2: Statistics of CTEST05
To collect the question-answer training data for
the S-SVM, we submitted 807 Chinese questions to
Google and extracted the candidates for each ques-
tion from the top 50 Google snippets. We then man-
ually selected the snippets containing the correct
answers as positive snippets, and designated all of
the other snippets as negative snippets. Finally, we
collected 807 hand-tagged Chinese question-answer
pairs as the training data of S-SVM called CTRAIN-
DATA.
4.2 Evaluation Method
In the experiments, the top m(= 50) Google snip-
pets are adopted to extract candidates by using a
3Currently no public testing question set for simplified Chi-
nese QA is available.
Chinese NER tool [Wu et al 2005]. The number of
the candidates extracted from the top m(= 50) snip-
pets, n, is adaptive for different questions but it does
not exceed 30. The results are evaluated in terms
of two scores, top n and mrr 5. Here, top n is the
rate at which at least one correct answer is included
in the top n answers, while mrr 5 is the average re-
ciprocal rank (1/n) of the highest rank n(n ? 5) of
a correct answer to each question.
4.3 U-SVM vs. Retrieval-M
The Retrieval-M selects the candidate with the short-
est distances to all question keywords as the cor-
rect answer. In this experiment, the Retrieval-M
is implemented based on the snippets returned by
Google, while the U-SVM is based on the SGS data,
the SBFS and BMFS feature. Table 3 summarizes
the comparative performance.
Table 3: Comparison of Retrieval-M and U-SVM
Retrieval-M U-SVM
top 1 27.84% 53.61%
CTREC04 mrr 5 43.67% 66.25%
top 5 71.13% 88.66%
top 1 34.00% 50.00%
CTREC05 mrr 5 48.20% 62.38%
top 5 71.33% 82.67%
The table shows that the U-SVM greatly improves
the performance of the Retrieval-M: the top 1 im-
provements for CTREC04 and CTREC05 are about
25.8% and 16.0%, respectively. This experiment
demonstrates that the assumptions used here in clus-
tering web search results and in classifying the ques-
tion are effective in many cases, and that the U-SVM
benefits from these assumptions.
4.4 U-SVM vs. S-SVM
To explore the effectiveness of our unsupervised
model as compared with the supervised model, we
conduct a cross-model comparison of the S-SVM
and the U-SVM with the SBFS and BMFS feature
sets. The U-SVM results are compared with the S-
SVM results for CTREC04 and CTREC05 in Ta-
bles 4 and 5, respectively. The S-SVM is trained
on CTRAINDATA.
These tables show the following:

U-SVM 57.44% 66.25%

U-SVM 58.01% 62.38%
top 5 S-SVM 72.00% 74.67%
U-SVM 75.33% 82.67%
? The proposed U-SVM significantly outper-
forms the S-SVM for all measurements and
all test data sets. For the CTREC04 test data
set, the top1 improvements for the FGS and
SGS data are about 14.5% and 14.4%, respec-
tively. For the CTREC05 test data set, the top1
score for the FGS data increases from 30.0%
to 48.0%, and the top 1 score for the SGS data
increases from 33.3% to 50.0%. Note that the
SBFS and BMFS features here is fewer than the
features in [Ittycheriah et al 2001; Suzuki et
al. 2002], but the comparison is still effective
because the models are compared in terms of
the same features. In the S-SVM, all questions
share the same training data, while the U-SVM
uses the unique pseudo-training data for each
question. This is the main reason why the U-
SVM performs better than the S-SVM does.
? The SGS data is greatly helpful for both
the U-SVM and the S-SVM. Compared with
the FGS data, the top 1/mrr 5/top 5 im-
provements for the S-SVM and the U-SVM
on CTREC04 are 8.25%/8.18%/8.25% and
7.25%/8.81%/12.37%. The SGS can be re-
garded as a kind of query expansion. The rea-
sons for this improvement are: the data sparse-
ness in FGS data is partially resolved; and the
use of the Web to introduce data redundancy
is helpful. [Clarke et al 2001; Magnini et al
2002; and Dumais et al 2002].
In the S-SVM, all of the test questions share the
same hand-tagged training data, so the WWFS fea-
tures cannot be easily used [Ittycheriah et al 2002;
Suzuki, et al 2002]. Tables 6 and 7 compare
the performances of the U-SVM with the (SBFS +
BMFS) features, the WWFS features, and combina-
tion of three types of features for the CTREC04 and
CTREC05 test data sets, respectively.
Table 6: Performances of U-SVM for Different Fea-
tures on CTREC04

mrr 5 62.38% 59.26% 65.61%
top 5 82.67% 74.00% 80.00%
These tables report that combining three types
of features can improve the performance of
the U-SVM. Using a combination of features
with the CTREC04 test data set results in the
best performances: 60.82%/71.31%/88.66% for
top 1/mrr 5/top 5. Similarly, as compared with
using the (SBFS + BMFS) and WWFS features, the
improvements from using a combination of features
with the CTREC05 test data set are 7.33%/3.23%/-
2.67% and 8.00%/6.35%/6.00%, respectively. The
results also demonstrate that the (SBFS + BMFS)
features are more important than the WWFS fea-
tures.
These comparative experiments indicate that the
U-SVM performs better than the S-SVM does, even
though the U-SVM is an unsupervised technique and
no hand-tagged training data is provided. The aver-
39
age top 1 improvements for both test data sets are
both more than 20%.
4.5 U-SVM vs. Pattern-M vs. S-SVM
To compare the U-SVM with the Pattern-M and
the S-SVM, we use the CTEST05 data set, shown
in Figure 3. The CTEST05 includes 14 different
question types, for example, Inventor Stuff (with
question like ?Who invented telephone??), Event-
Day (with question like ?when is World Day for Wa-
ter??), and so on. The Pattern-M uses the depen-
dency syntactic answer patterns learned in [Wu et
al. 2007] to extract the answer, and named entities
are also used to filter noise from the candidates.
Figure 3: Statistics of CTEST05
Table 8 summarizes the performances of the U-
SVM, Pattern-M, and S-SVM models on CTEST05.
Table 8: Comparison of U-SVM, Pattern-M and S-
SVM on CTEST05
S-SVM Pattern-M U-SVM
top 1 44.89% 53.14% 59.09%
mrr 5 56.49% 61.28% 67.34%
top 5 74.43% 73.14% 81.82%
The results in the table show that the U-SVM
significantly outperforms the S-SVM and Pattern-
M, while the S-SVM underperforms the Pattern-
M. Compared with the Pattern-M, the U-SVM in-
creases the top 1/mrr 5/top 5 scores by 5.95%/
6.06%/8.68%, respectively. The reasons may lie in
the following:
? The Chinese dependency parser influences de-
pendency syntactic answer-pattern extraction,
and thus degrades the performance of the
Pattern-M model.
? The imperfection of Google snippets affects
pattern matching, and thus adversely influences
the Pattern-M model. From the cross-model
comparison, we conclude that the performance
ranking of these models is: U-SVM > Pattern-
M > S-SVM > Retrieval-M.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presents an unsupervised machine learn-
ing technique (called the U-SVM) for answer selec-
tion that is validated in Chinese open-domain web
QA. Regarding answer selection as a kind of classifi-
cation task, the U-SVM automatically learns clusters
and pseudo-training data for each cluster by cluster-
ing web search results. It then selects the correct
answer from the candidates according to classifying
the question. The contribution of this paper is that
it presents an unsupervised machine learning tech-
nique for web QA that starts with only a user ques-
tion. The results of our experiments with three test
data sets are encouraging. As compared with the
S-SVM, the top 1 performances of the U-SVM for
the CTREC04 and CTREC05 data sets are signifi-
cantly improved, at more than 20%. Moreover, the
U-SVM performs better than the Retrieval-M and
the Pattern-M.
These experiments have only validated the U-
SVM on named entity types of questions that ac-
count for about 82% of all TREC2004 and 2005
FACTOID test questions. In fact, our technique is
independent of question types only if the candidates
can be extracted. In the future, we will explore the
effectiveness of our technique for the other types of
questions. The web search results clustering in the
U-SVM defines that a candidate in a Google snip-
pet can represent the ?signature? of its cluster. This
definition, however, is not always effective. To fil-
ter noise in the pseudo-training data, we will extract
relations between the candidates and the keywords
as the cluster signatures of Google snippets. More-
over, applying the U-SVM to QA systems in other
languages, like English and Japanese, will also be
included in our future work.
