Abstract 
: This paper presents a novel multi-lingual progress protocol generation module. The module 
is used within the speech-to--speech translation system VERBMOBIL. The task of the protocol 
is to give the dialogue partners a brief description of the content of their dialogue. We utilize 
an .abstract representation describing, for instance, thematic information and dialogue acts 
of the dialogue utterances. From this representation we generate simplified paraphrases of 
the individual turns of the dialogue which together make up the protocol. Instead of writing 
completely new software, the protocol generation component is almost exclusively composed 
of already existing modules in the system which are extended by planning and formatting 
routines for protocol formulations. We describe how the abstract information is extracted from 
user utterances in different languages and how the abstract hematic representation is used to 
generate a protocol in one specific language. Future directions are given. 
1 In t roduct ion  
VERBMOBIL is a research project aiming at a Speech-To-Speech translation system for Face-to- 
Face dialogues \[Bub and Schwinn 1996, Bub, Wahlster, and Waibel 1997, Wahlster 1993\]. In its 
first phase (1993 - 1996), a bilingual (English-German) system for time scheduling negotiation 
dialogues was developed. For its current second phase (1997 -2000), a third language, Japanese, 
has been incorporated. Additionally, more than two people should be able to participate in the 
dialogue, a setting we call multi-party. For the second phase, a novel system feature is currently 
under development - protocol generation. The idea is to provide the user(s ) with three kinds of 
protocols: 
P rogress  P ro toco l  The most salient parts of the dialogue are summarized. 
Resu l t  P ro toco l  The result of the negotiation is summarized. 
S ta tus  P ro toco l  The current status of the negotiation is summarized. 
The first two are generated after the dialogue is finished. For the result protocol, a summarization 
of the goal reached in the negotiation is generated. The progress protocol serves as a simplified 
recapitulation of the progress of the dialogue, whereas the status protocol will, on  demand, be 
generated uring the ongoing dialogue. Its task is to deliver a brief description of the current status 
of the dialogue. All protocols must be generated in all three languages, putt ing extra requests on 
the protocol generation component; particularly, being as language independent as possible. In 
this paper we focus on the first of the protocol types listed above - the progress protocol.

2.1 Some termino logy  
A turn is a contribution of one dialogue participant. It may be divided into segments, which 
sometimes resemble linguistic lauses like sentences. Basic processing entity for some comPonents 
is the so-called ialogue act \[Bunt 1981, Jekat et al 1995, Alexandersson et al 1997\]. For this work 
we use a set of 18 dialogue acts, some purely illocutionary, e.g., requesting a proposal for a date. 
Some comprise propositional content, e.g., proposing a date. An important property of the dialogue 
act is its language independence - it should be possible to be used for the annotation of dialogues 
in any language. Linguistic information is encoded in an abstract data type, the so called VIT ? 
(VERBMOBIL Interface Term, \[Bos et al 1996, Dorna 1996\]). A VIT is a semantic representation 
formalism following the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) of \[Kamp and Reyle 1993\]. A VIT 
consists of a set of semantic onditions (i.e. predicates, roles, operators and quantifiers) and allows 
for under-specifications with respect o scope and subordination or inherent under-specifications. 
Each discourse individual is formally represented by a discourse referent (also called instance). 
Information about the individual is encoded by one (or more) VIT-condition(s), combining a 
predicate with the discourse referent (see section 4). 
? Propositional information (currently time expressions) is encoded in a knowledge representation 
language \[Kiissner and Stede 1995\]. It is a quite surface-oriented language, but contains some 
interlingua-like expressions for, e.g., month-of-year (moy), weekdays (dow), time-of-day (rod) and 
part-of-day(pod). Figure 1 gives some examples, of so-called "tempexl-expressions ".

2.2 The  VERBMOBIL sys tem 
The VERBMOBIL system is a flexible, speaker independent speech-to-speech translation system for 
spontaneous speech. To support the robustness of the overall system, the translation process is 
subdivided into several processing tracks. The most accurat e translation track is a deep linguistic? 
analysis in combination with semantic transfer and syntactic generation (see figure 2). When this 
track fails, the translation is performed by other shallow; translation components. In this paper we 
will just consider the dialogue act based analysis and transfer \[Block 1997\]. Effects of spontaneous 
speech like hesitations, corrected and revised utterance parts do not provide any translation- and 
thereby protocol- relevant information. They have to be recognized and filtered out during the 
analysis and/or translation process. In figure 2 a sketch of some of the linguistic components i
given. The translation process consists of two tracks, the deep and the shallow translation. The deep 
linguistic translation track, whose modules all exchange linguistic information encoded in VITs, 
consists of three components: An HPSG-parser combined with a robust semantic omponent, 
1TEMPoral EXpression 
199 
the semantic based transfer component \[Dorna nd Emele 1996\] and the generation component 
\[Becket et al 1998\], an efficient-multi-lingual generator (some more details below). 
The shallow track bases its translation on dialogue acts and the propositional content (cur- 
rently time expressions). Based on the input string, the dialogue act is determined, which in corn- 
= - .... ' - - k  
=o-I I-. 
Figure 2: Overview of the VERBMOBIL system 
bination with the propositional 
content is transfered using fixed 
templates. The DIAKON com- 
ponent exchanges contextual in- 
formation with 15 different com- 
ponents. It consists of two sub- 
components, the Context Disam- 
biguation component and the Di- 
alogue component. The former is 
responsible for, e.g., the disam- 
biguation of semantic predicates? 
and the computation of time ex- 
pressions. The latter, following 
a hybrid approach (more details 
in the next section), supports, for 
instance, the analysis component with top down predictions what dialogue act is next to come. 
3 Requirements for the protocol generation 
The protocol may contain original system translations as well as paraphrases of the user utterances 
depending on the translation system's internal information about them. Additionally, thematically 
irrelevant parts of the dialogue, i.e. dialogue contributions not relating to the communicative goal, 
should not be reflected in the protocol. Moreover, some information is condensed in the protocol 
structure (in comparison to the original dialogue contributions) or removed from the protocol 
Structure following different criteria of "protocol relevance". Example of the latter are utterances 
annotated with the dialogue acts e.g. FEEDBACK_  $ or  DELIBERATE_* can under most circumstances 
be removed. We are putting extra attention to this, since the removal of utterances and turns 
must not threaten the correctness of the protocol (e.g. the dialogue must still reflect the actual 
negotiation). Parts of the dialogue, e.g., clarification sub-dialogues, can under some circumstances 
be left out from the protocol. Stereotypical dialogue phases like the greeting phase, are reflected 
in  the protocol by meta comments. This Procedure? has the following advantages: 
1. The structure of the protocol is very close to the original dialogue and therefore it is easy to 
follow for dialogue participants as well as for someone lse. 
2. The use of the original system translations into the language of the protocol instead of para- 
phrases implifies the recapitulation of the dialogue for the dialogue participants later on. 
3. The use of paraphrases of user utterances in the output language of the protocol emphasizes 
that the system has "understood" the user contributions. 
? Furthermore,. by utilizing different sources of information, e.g., deep and shallow processing, we can 
always generate a protocol. The planning procedure of a protocol formulation depends on whether 
the original turn segment was given in the output language of the protocol or not. We have to keep 
in mind that the dialogue partners peak different languages which means that about half of the 
protocol has to be re-constructed (i.e. condensed and paraphrased) from utterances in the output 
language of the protocol. The other half of the protocol formulations may consist of utterances 
which were translated into the output language of the protocol by the system. Consequentty~ the 
planning procedure operates as follows:

System Translat ions If the system translated the user utterance into the output language of 
the protocol, this translation is chosen as the protocol formulation. In a system translation 
all irrelevant effects of spontaneous speech (e.g., hesitations, corrected or revised utterance 
parts) are already removed so that the selected protocol formulation is reduced to thematically 
relevant information. 
Deep V IT - representat ion  In the opposite case (i.e. the user utterance was spoken in the output 
language of the protocol) the original VIT-representation f the user input produced by the 
deep analysis component (if such a VIT exists) is used.  The phrase is then produces by 
re-generating from the VIT. Again, effects of spontaneity are removed in such a VIT. 
Tempex-V IT  In all other cases (i.e. there is no deep analysis of the user utterance) we useth? 
language independent tempex mechanism whose handling with respect o the planning of 
protocol formulations i described below. 
Up to this point only the third type has been implemented.

Figure 3: The Sequence Memory and the Intentional Structure of the Dialogue Module 
For the extraction of protocol relevant data, we utilize a part of the DIAKON module, namely 
the dialogue module \[Alexandersson, Reithinger, and Maier 1997\], a hybrid component consisting 
of a dialogue memory, a statistical component, and a plan processor. Its processing is centered 
around dialogue acts \[Jekat et al 1995\] - it is assumed that every utterance can be attributed 
one (or more) dialogue acts. important parts of the dialogue module are the sequence memory, 
which contains data structures for turns and segments (see figur e 3). Each turn keeps information 
like speaker and source language. In each segment information like the dialogue act, thematic 
information and VITs for different languages are stored. 
201 
4.1 The  P lan  Processor  
We use the plan processor \[Alexandersson a d Reithinger 1997\] for the selection of protocol rele- 
vant data. It incrementally traverses the sequence memory, building a structure which we call the 
intentional structure. It is a tree like structure mirroring different abstractions of the dialogue, like 
segment (dialogue act), turn (turn class), greeting phase. In figure 3 a sketch of the intentional 
structure is shown: It divides into 4 distinct levels, where the top-most spans over the whole dia- 
logue, the next distinguishes the dialogue phases greeting, negotiation and closing. The third level 
connects egments within a turn and distinguishes its turn-class. Finally, the fourth implements  
(with some minor extensions) the dialogue act hierarchy. The leaves correspond to the utterance(s) 
of a turn. For each translation track, one instance of the processor is used, but the figure shows 
just one. The plan processor uses a set of plan operators (currently about 175) (see figure 4 and 5).

Figure 4: A Plan Operator for Processing Utterances of Type FEEDBACK_ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
Both hand-coded as well as automatically derived operators from the VERBMOBIL corpus are used 
to build its structure. The operators are incrementally expanded left to right using a mixed top 
down and bottom up strategy. A plan operator can be attributed with const ra in ts  and act ions .  
The constraints are used to check the relevance of a certain operator in a certain context, whereas 
the actions are mostly affecting the context. Examples of the latter are: marking an utterance as 
being protocol relevant or not, or setting the dialogue phase. 
4.2 Cent ra l  Contents  o f  a Turn  
By determining the central contents we remove unimportant segments and merge segments in such a 
way that the intended meaning of the turn is preserved. The plan processor performs this operation 
on two levels: based on ?segments and based on turns. By looking at, for instance, the dialogue act, 
it can be determined whether the segment can be removed or not. More abstract plan operators are 
responsible for removing whole turns. An example of the latter is clarification sub-dialogues. This, 
however, turns out to be very difficult when scaling up, due to irregularities in the dialogues and 
more problematic: recognition errors. In the current implementation, the plan processor performs 
two operations on the context: (i) Marking a segment as (not) relevant for the protocol, and (ii) 
Merging two or more segments into one. 
Figure 4 shows a plan operator designed for processing an utterance which has been annotated 
with the dialogue FEEDBACK..ACKNOWLEDGMENT. The operator is designed for being applied when 
the utterance is the first one in the turn, and it is stated that, unless this utterance is the only one 
in the turn, it is marked as not relevant for the protocol. Another example of actions is shown in 
figure 5. This operator is used for merging two successive utterances of type ACCEPT_DATE into 
one. This is done when not more than one of the utterances contains propositional contents. To 
clarify the concept of "central contents" further, consider the following turn taken from our corpus 
(figure 6). If we use similar operators as in figure 4 for processing the second and third segment 
- as pointed out before, deliberations and feedbacks can under most circumstances be removed

4.3 Turn ing  a segment  into a V IT  
Preparing the input for the surface generator we want to prepare it in the same format that it is 
already able to cope with in the translation mode: VITs. Furthermore we prefer a format that it is 
usable for not just one language, but for all three. 
If we construct, e.g., German VITs for protocol for- ,,~,x(,7,,,.,1) 
mulations we can utilize the transfer component to ~ I ~ ~7~ i~__~ 
transfer the V-ITs into any other VERBMOBIL Inn- , 0 
guage, and then make use of the surface generator ~ l / /  .~\[,~ .d.,:~.~:--- 
as it is. This task is split into two steps, where the 15 Jittery \ [~ l l l l \ ] / /  ,-\ok ~ l~ IA2\ ]~ 
first consists of generating partial language inde- \[,~,~p_, 
pendent VITs (henceforth tempex-VIT) on basis 
of the information in the selected segments (see Figure 7: VIT-semantics of a time expression 
below). The second step involves enriching the partial VITs with language dependent, e.g., verb- 
information (-see section 5). 
Additionally, the plan processor draws more global inferences like, which dialogue phase a 
segment is part of. It also determines the turn class; information which we utilize while prepar- 
ing the VITs, for instance when determining the sentence mood for a segment. For the utter- 
ance "How about at 2 o'clock" the corresponding information could be the dialogue act SUG- 
GEST._SUPPORT..DATE and the tempex expression \ [ rod :02 :00 \ ] .  A graphical represer~tation of the 
partial VIT for thissegment is shown in figure 7. 
203 
The index/3 is the entry point from where the VIT can be traversed. From the entry point 
we can reach the first grouping (15). It is pointing at a representation the instance i2, which is 
containing the representation for 2 o'clock (crime). The udef predicate stands for indefiniteness, 
with scopus over crime (via grouping 13). Finally, cemp_/oc is an under-specification f r temporal 
or locational - the resolution of this under-specification s solved in the second step or by the surface 
generator. 
4 .4  Input  to  the  syntact i ca l  generator  
We can now produce the input structure for the generator. It contains on one hand general 
information about the dialogue (which is initially stored in the dialogue memory) and on the other 
hand an ordered list of protocol-relevant i formation of the individual Segments of the turns. The  
following information is included in the abstract protocol representation:? 
? the date, time and location where the dialogue took place, 
? the beginning time and the end time of the dialogue, 
? a detailed list describing the thematic ontents of all turns of the dialogue. Each of the turn 
descriptions includes the information about (i) speaker, and (ii) a detailed escription of the 
individual segments of the turn each of which contains the following information: dialogue 
phase, dialogue act, sentence mood, turn class, a deep VIT of the original user utterance (if 
i t  exists), the original system translation, and the tempex-VIT as described above. 
5 Surface Generat ion  of the Protocol  
The general parts of the representation produced by the DIAKON module can be handed over 
to the protocol more or less directly while the ?information about the individual turns and their 
segments i  abstract and has, therefore, to be the source of a planning process of an appropriate 
protocol formulation. In order to keep the original ordering of turns and their segments intact, 
our module generates one protocol formulation for each segment. The planning of an appropriate 
protocol formulation for one segment has to consider different cases which require different planning 
procedures tocome up with a formulation. 
5.1 F rom Tempex-V IT  to  P ro toco l  Representat ions  
The processing proceeds on the semantic level based on the VIT-formalism but now switching 
to language specific operations. We defined a structured set of VIT-patterns whose task is to 
insert a verb into the tempex-VIT (which only contains time expressions) and its obligatory verb 
arguments in order to come up with a complete sentence. This final VIT-representation will then 
be handed over to the generation module of the VERBMOBIL system for verbalization. The core 
planning step consists of the selection and application of an appropriate VIT-pattern of a segment 
which is determined by the following three main criteria: 
? The first criterion to find an applicable pattern is the dialogue act of the segment which 
means that for all 18 possible dialogue acts ?there is a structured list of applicable patterns. 
*:The second criterion is the sentence mood of the user utterance. 
? The third one is the question whether the time expression contained in the tempex-VIT can 
be assigned irectly to a verb argument position or not. This distinction is important because 
it requires different semantic handling of the tempex-VIT (e.g., the subject argument of the 
main verb).

Figure 8: Example of a Pattern choice net 
The entry is organized as a discrimination tree consisting of declaratively annotated alter- 
nating tests and values. The test-key :sentence-mood stands for the test of the sentence mood 
of a segment representation, :tempex checks for the existence of a tempex-VIT (which is not 
Figure 9: VIT-semantics of a protocol formulation 
necessarily the case - as in figure 6, an AC- 
CEPT ca21 contain a temporal expression or 
not.) and :abst r - tempex checks the men- 
tioned distinction whether the time expres- 
sion of a tempex-VIT can be assigned irectly 
to a verb argument position or not. Sen- 
tence moods above are quest (question) and 
decl (declarative). The keyword VALUE indi- 
cates, e.g., (vei'b4-ppron-subj-/-tempez-pp frei- 
haben). This is a pattern function which will 
be applied on the tempex-VIT. In this case 
the verb freihaben and a personal pronoun in subject position (ppron-subj) will be added to the 
tempex-VIT which will presumably be realized as a prepositional phrase (tempex-pp). The ap- 
plication of verb?ppron-subj-/-tempex-pp to the example VIT in figure 7 (which is a (language 
independent) representation for "at 2 o'clock ?" as an elliptical question) results in the language 
specific (German) VIT given in figure 9 .  
The semantic structure of the tim( 
dition temp_loc for discourse referent 
il of the tempex-VIT has been ex- 
changed by a condition for the German 
(temporally intended) preposition um 
(at). I1 is extended furthermore by 
the main verb /reihaben and a con- 
dition for its verb argument in sub- 
ject position (argl) which is realized 
by the personal pronoun (pron) in i3. 
The verbalization of this VIT will be 
"Haben Sic um 2 Uhr frei ?" (literally: 
!'Are you at 2 o'clock free ?"). 
expression remains unchanged. The under-specified con-

5.2 Syntact i c  Generat ion  and  Protoco l  Format t ing  
The VIT-semantics of the protocol formulation is then handed over to the syntactic generator 
VM-GECO \[Becket et al 1998\] for verbalization. VM-GECO is a highly efficient multi-lingual 
generation component which consists of a language independent kernel syntactic generator and 
language specific declarative knowledge sources for syntactic and lexical choices. The last step of 
our protocol generation module is the formatting of the protocol into an easily understandable 
and readable format. As the protocol consists of global information about the dialogue itself as 
well as paraphrased turn segments we chose a protocol format which allows for clear distinction 
between these parts of the protocol. Furthermore it is important to assign the speaker's name (if it 
is known) to the protocol formulations of each turn. There are three different formatting devices. 
The most prominent one is the production of a HTML-format of the protocol. Additionally, I~TEX 
and ASCII versions are available. 
Figure 10 shows an example dialogue and the respective system translations. Figure 11 shows 
the HTML-format of the protocol 3 of this dialogue.

6 Conc lus ions  and  Future  work  
We presented a novel module for progress protocol generation. Up to now at least 20 different 
protocols have been successfully generated. There are still open questions to be answered and 
further work is necessary to get a system able to generate more natural and flexible protocols. 
Future attention are and will be payed to: (i) Extending the current protocol?generator to the 
generation of result and status protocols. Currently we are developing a language independent 
representation f propositional contents of turns and dialogues as a whole and also extending the 
generation component to produce coherent paragraphs. (ii) Indirect speech: By utilizing abstract 
information like dialogue act and propositional contents of the segments, we are free to switch to 
indirect speech. Rules and heuristics for when and how have to be developed. (iii) By coupling the 
thematic structure more tightly to the plan processor we hope to be able to utilize information like 
given-new and contrast, thereby generating more natural paraphrases, and determining when and 
how two segments carrying the same dialogue act and temporal information can be merged. (iv) The

use of the transfer component to transfer the German protocol formulations into other languages. 
(v) Reduction: Better and more accurate rules for the reduction of clarification sub-dialogues have 
to be developed. (vi) Heuristics for the choice between multiple applicable VIT-patterns. Finally, 
(vii) Alignment: Rules and heuristics for the alignment of successive segments and turns.
