Abstract
The absence of a comprehensive database
of locations where bacteria live is an im-
portant obstacle for biologists to under-
stand and study the interactions between
bacteria and their habitats. This paper re-
ports the results to a challenge, set forth by
the Bacteria Biotopes Task of the BioNLP
Shared Task 2013. Two systems are ex-
plained: Sub-task 1 system for identifying
habitat mentions in unstructured biomedi-
cal text and normalizing them through the
OntoBiotope ontology and Sub-task 2 sys-
tem for extracting localization and part-
of relations between bacteria and habitats.
Both approaches rely on syntactic rules
designed by considering the shallow lin-
guistic analysis of the text. Sub-task 2
system also makes use of discourse-based
rules. The two systems achieve promising
results on the shared task test data set.
1 Introduction
As the number of publications in the biomedical
domain continues to increase rapidly, information
retrieval systems which extract valuable informa-
tion from these publications have become more
important for scientists to access and utilize the
knowledge contained in them.
Most previous tasks on biomedical informa-
tion extraction focus on identifying interactions
and events among bio-molecules (Krallinger et al,
2008; Kim et al, 2009). The Bacteria Biotope
Task (Bossy et al, 2011; Bossy et al, 2012) is one
of the new challenges in this domain, which was
firstly presented in the BioNLP 2011 Shared Task.
The main goals of the Bacteria Biotope Task were
to extract bacteria locations, categorize them into
one of the eight types (Environment, Host, Host-
Part, Geographical, Water, Food, Medical, Soil),
and detect Localization and PartOf events between
bacteria and habitats. Automatically extracting
this information from textual sources is crucial for
creating a comprehensive database of bacteria and
habitat relations. Such a resource would be of
great value for research studies and applications
in several fields such as microbiology, health sci-
ences, and food processing.
Three teams participated in the Bacteria
Biotope Task using different methodologies
(Bossy et al, 2011; Bossy et al, 2012). Bibliome
INRA (Ratkovic et al, 2012), which achieved the
best F-score (45%) among these teams, imple-
mented a system which used both linguistic fea-
tures and reasoning over an ontology to predict lo-
cation boundaries and types. Bibliome also uti-
lized some resources such as NCBI Taxonomy1,
list of Agrovoc geographical names2, and an in-
house developed ontology for specific location
types. UTurku (Bjo?rne et al, 2012), presented a
machine-learning based system which can be used
to find solutions for all main tasks with a few al-
teration in the system. UTurku used this generic
system with additional named entity recognition
patterns and external resources, whereas JAIST
(Nguyen and Tsuruoka, 2011) used CRFs in order
to recognize entities and their types.
UTurku and JAIST treated event extraction as a
classification problem by using machine learning
approaches, while Bibliome created and utilized
a trigger-word list. Bibliome tried to find events
by checking if a trigger-word and entities co-occur
in the scope of the same sentence. Bibliome was
the only team that considered coreference resolu-
tion. Not considering coreference resolution de-
teriorated the performance of JAIST?s system less
than that of UTurku?s system, since JAIST?s sys-
tem operated in the scope of a paragraph, while
UTurku?s system operated in the scope of a sen-

tence.
The Bacteria Biotope Task (BB) in the BioNLP
2013 Shared Task (Bossy et al, 2013) gives an-
other opportunity to scientists to develop and com-
pare their systems on a reliable platform. This task
contains three subtasks. For Sub-task 1, partici-
pants are expected to detect the names and posi-
tions of habitat entities, as well as to normalize
these habitats through the OntoBiotope (MBTO)
Ontology concepts. For Sub-task 2, when the
names, types, and positions of the entities (bacte-
ria, habitat, geographical) are given, participants
are expected to extract relations which can be ei-
ther between bacteria and habitat pairs (Localiza-
tion event) or between host and host part pairs
(PartOf event). Sub-task 3 is the same as Sub-
task 2, except that the gold standard entities are
not provided to the participants.
In this paper, we present two systems, one
for Sub-task 1 (Entity Detection and Categoriza-
tion) and one for Sub-task 2 (Localization Rela-
tion Extraction) of the Bacteria Biotope Task in
the BioNLP 2013 Shared Task. Both systems are
rule-based and utilize the shallow syntactic analy-
sis of the documents. The Sub-task 2 system also
makes use of the discourse of the documents. The
technical details of our systems are explained in
the following sections.
2 Data Set
The corpus provided by the organizers was cre-
ated by collecting documents from many differ-
ent web sites, which contain general information
about bacteria and habitats. The data set, consist-
ing of 52 training, 26 development, and 26 test
documents, was annotated by the bioinformati-
cians of the Bibliome team of MIG Laboratory at
the Institut National de Recherche Agronomique
(INRA).
For the training and development phases of Sub-
task 1, document texts with manually annotated
habitat entities and the concepts assigned to them
through the OntoBiotope ontology were provided,
while in the test phase, only the unannotated docu-
ment texts were given by the task organizers. The
OntoBiotope ontology which contains 1,700 con-
cepts organized in a hierarchy of is-a relations was
also provided by the organizers for this task.
For the training and development phases of Sub-
task 2, document texts with manually annotated
bacteria, habitat and geographical entities, as well
as the localization and part-of relations were pro-
vided, while in the test phase, document texts an-
notated only for bacteria, habitat and geographical
entities were given.
3 Bacteria Biotope Detection and
Ontology-based Normalizaton
For Sub-task 1 (Entity Detection and Categoriza-
tion), we implemented a system which applies
syntactic rules to biomedical text after a pre-
processing phase, where a given text is split into
sentences and parsed using a shallow parser. The
workflow of our Sub-task 1 system is shown in
Figure 1. Firstly, each input file is split into sen-
tences using the Genia Sentence Splitter (Geni-
aSS) (Saetre et al, 2007). The outputs of the
splitter are given to the Genia Tagger (Tsuruoka
et al, 2005; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) as input
files with the aim of obtaining the lemmas, the
part-of-speech (POS) tags, and the constituent cat-
egories of the words in the given biomedical text
(e.g., surface form: ticks; lemma: tick; POS tag:
NNS; phrase structure: I-NP). We utilized these
syntactic information at the following steps of our
system.
In the following subsections, a detailed expla-
nation for the detection of habitat boundaries and
their normalization through the OntoBiotope On-
tology concepts is provided.
3.1 Entity Boundary Detection
Entity boundary detection, which is the first step of
Sub-task 1, includes automatic extraction of habi-
tat entities from a given natural language text, and
detection of the entity boundaries precisely. In
other words, the habitat boundaries that are re-
trieved from the texts should not include any un-
necessary and non-informative words. In order to
achieve this goal, we assume that bacteria habitats
are embedded in text as noun phrases, and all noun
phrases are possible candidates for habitat entities.
Based on this assumption, our system follows the
steps that are explained below by using the mod-
ules that are shown in Figure 1.
As explained before, the Sentence Splitter,
POS Tagger, and Shallow Parser are the mod-
ules that are utilized in the pre-processing phase.
The Noun Phrase Extractor & Simplifier
module firstly detects the noun phrases in the
text by using the Genia Tagger and then post-
processes these noun phrases by using some syn-

tactic rules. The functions of this module include
the removal of some unnecessary words from the
noun phrases, which are not informative for envi-
ronmental locations of bacteria. To distinguish in-
formative words from non-informative ones, our
system utilizes the POS Tags of each word that
compose the noun phrases in question. For ex-
ample, words that have determiners or possessive
pronouns as their POS Tags should not be included
to the boundaries of the candidate habitat enti-
ties. For example, the in the noun phrase ?the
soybean plant Glycine max? and its in the noun
phrase ?its infectious saliva? are eliminated from
the candidate noun phrases, restricting the habi-
tat boundary, and creating new candidate noun
phrases.
The Noun Phrase Extractor & Simplifier mod-
ule also includes a mechanism to handle noun
phrases that contain the conjunction ?and?. First,
such noun phrases are separated from the conjunc-
tion ?and? into two sub-phrases. Next, each sub-
phrase is searched in the OntoBiotope ontology.
If the ontology entries matched for the two sub-
phrases have the same direct ancestor (i.e., the
two ontology entries have a common is-a relation),
then the noun phrase consisting of the two sub-
phrases connected with the conjunction ?and? is
identified as a single habitat entity. On the other
hand, if the ontology entries matched for the two
sub-phrases don?t have a common direct ances-
tor, then each sub-phrase is identified as a sepa-
rate habitat entity. For example, each of the entity
boundaries of the phrases ?nasal and oral cav-
ity? , ?fresh and salt water?, and ?human and
sheep? are handled differently from each other as
described below.
? For the first phrase, ?nasal? is the first sub-
phrase and ?oral cavity? is the second sub-
phrase. The direct ancestor (i.e., the first level
is-a concept) of the first sub-phrase ?nasal?
is ?respiratory tract part? and that of the
second sub-phrase ?oral cavity? is ?buccal?.
Since ?respiratory tract part? and ?buccal?
is-a concepts are not the same, ?nasal cav-
ity? and ?oral cavity? are generated as two
separate habitats. In other words, if there is
not a direct common is-a concept between
the matching terms for the sub-phrases in
the OntoBiotope ontology, then one habitat
entity ?nasal cavity? is generated from the
noun phrase by adding the second part of the
second sub-phrase ?cavity? to the first sub-
phrase ?nasal? and another entity is gener-
ated by taking the second sub-phrase as a
whole ?oral cavity?.
? For the second sample phrase, ?fresh? is the
first sub-phrase and ?salt water? is the sec-
ond sub-phrase. The first sub-phrase ?fresh?
matches with an ontology entry whose direct
ancestor is ?environmental water with chem-
ical property? and the second sub-phrase
?salt water? matches with an ontology entry
that has two different direct ancestors ?en-
vironmental water with chemical property?
and ?saline water?. Since ?environmental
water with chemical property? is a common
ancestor for both sub-phrases in the ontology,
a single habitat entity ?fresh and salt water?
is generated. In other words, if there is a di-
rect common ancestor between the matching
terms for the sub-phrases in the OntoBiotope
ontology, then only one habitat entity that is
composed of the whole noun phrase is gener-
ated.
172
? For the third phrase, ?human? is the first
sub-phrase and ?sheep? is the second sub-
phrase. In this case, two separate habitat en-
tities ?human? and ?sheep? are generated di-
rectly from the two sub-phrases since they
don?t have a common ancestor in the ontol-
ogy.
At the end of these phases, purified sub-noun
phrases, which are habitat entity candidates whose
boundaries are roughly determined by the deletion
of non-informative modifiers from noun phrases,
are obtained.
To determine whether a candidate noun phrase
is a habitat entity or not, the Habitat Name Rec-
ognizer & Normalizer module searches all on-
tology entries, which compose the OntoBiotope
Ontology, to find an exact match with the candi-
date noun phrase or with parts of it. In this step,
the names, exact synonyms, and related synonyms
of ontology entries (ontology entry features) are
compared with the candidate noun phrase.

Table 1: First ontology entity match for human
gastrointestinal tract.
For example, if our candidate noun phrase is
?the human gastrointestinal tract?, after the post-
processing phase, the purified candidate phrase
will be ?human gastrointestinal tract?. When
the search step for this simplified candidate entity
is handled, two different ontology entries are re-
turned by our system as matches (see Table 1 for
the first ontology entry match and Table 2 for the
second one). These two ontology entries are re-
turned as results by our system because the first
one contains the related synonym: ?gastrointesti-
nal tract? and the second one contains the name:
human. Since the system returns matches for
the candidate noun phrase ?human gastrointesti-
nal tract?, it is verified that one or more habitat
entities can be extracted from this phrase.
To detect the exact habitat boundaries, manually
developed syntactic rules are utilized in addition to

the ontology entry matching algorithm, which is
used for entity verification of a candidate phrase.
Our system determines the boundaries according
to the following syntactic rules:
? If an ontology entry matches exactly with the
noun phrase, take the boundaries of the noun
phrase as the boundaries of the habitat, and
use the whole phrase to create a new habitat
entity.
? If an ontology entry matches beginning from
the first word of the noun phrase, but does
not match totally, take the boundaries of the
matched parts of the phrase, and create a new
habitat entity using the partial phrase.
? If an ontology entry matches beginning from
an internal word of the noun phrase, take the
boundaries of the noun phrase as the bound-
aries of the habitat, and use the whole phrase
to create a new habitat entity. For exam-
ple, in Table 1, the match of the noun phrase
?human gastrointestinal tract? with the re-
lated synonym: ?gastrointestinal tract? gen-
erates ?human gastrointestinal tract? as a
habitat entity.
In many cases habitat entity names occur in dif-
ferent inflected forms in text. For example, the
habitat name ?human?, can occur in text in its plu-
ral form as ?humans?. We used the Lemmatizer
module in order to be able to match the differ-
ent inflected forms of habitat names occurring in
text against the corresponding entires in the Onto-
Biotope ontology. This module applies the rules
described above to the lemmatized forms of the
candidate noun phrases, which are obtained using
the Genia Tagger.
After running the same algorithm also for lem-
matized forms of the noun phrase, a merging algo-
rithm is used for the matching results of the sur-
173
face and lemmatized forms of the noun phrases in
order to create an output file, which contains the
predicted habitat entities and their positions in the
input text.
3.2 Ontology Categorization
For Sub-task 1, detection of the entities and their
boundaries is not sufficient. In order to obtain
normalized entity names, participants are also ex-
pected to assign at least one ontology concept
from the OntoBiotope Ontology to all habitat en-
tities, which are automatically extracted by their
systems from the input text.
While our system detects entities and their
boundaries (as explained in detail in Section 3.1),
it also assigns ontology concepts to the re-
trieved entities. All assigned concepts are ref-
erenced by the MBTO-IDs of the matched on-
tology entries (e.g, MBTO:00001402 for human
and MBTO:00001828 for human gastrointestinal
tract) (see Table 3).
4 Event Extraction
For Sub-task 2 (Localization Event Extraction
Task), we used different methods according to the
relation type that we are trying to extract. The
workflow of our system is shown in Figure 2. The
details of our approach are explained in the fol-
lowing sub-sections.
4.1 Localization Event Extraction
In order to extract localization relations, we as-
sume that discourse changes with the beginning of
a new paragraph. Our system firstly splits the in-
put text into paragraphs. Next, the entities (bacte-
ria and habitats) that occur in the given paragraph
are identified. We assume that the paragraph is
about the bacterium whose name occurs first in the
paragraph. Therefore, we assign all the habitat en-
tities to that bacterium. If the name of this bac-
terium occurs in previous paragraphs as well, then
the boundary of the bacterium entity is set to its
first occurrence in the document.
We also have a special case for boundary de-
termination of bacteria in the localization rela-
tion. If a bacterium name contains the word
?strain? , we assign the first occurrence of its
name without the word ?strain? (e.g, Bifidobac-
terium longum NCC2705 instead of Bifidobac-
terium longum strain NCC2705).
Figure 2: Workflow of the Sub-task 2 System
4.2 PartOf Event Extraction
In order to detect partOf relations between hosts
and host parts in a given biomedical text, we as-
sumed that such relations can only exist if the
host and the host part entities occur in the same
paragraph. Based on this assumption, we pro-
pose that if a habitat name is a subunit of the term
which identifies another habitat that passes in the
same discourse, then they are likely to be related
through a partOf relation. In other words, if one
habitat contains the other one, and obeys some
syntactic rules, then there is a relation. For exam-
ple, ?respiratory track of animals? is a habitat and
?animals? is another habitat, both of which are in
the same paragraph. Since the ?respiratory track
of animals? phrase contains the ?animals? phrase
and the word ?of?, and the ?animals? phrase is on
the right hand side of the ?respiratory track of ani-
mals? phrase, our system detects a partOf relation
between them.

For Sub-task 1, submissions are evaluated con-
sidering the Slot Error Rate (SER), which depends
on the number of substitutions S, deletions D, in-
sertions I, and N. N is the number of habitats in
the reference, while D and I are the number of
reference and predicted entities that could not be
paired, respectively.
SER =
S + D + I
N
(1)
The number of substitutions S is calculated by
using Equation 2. Here J is the Jaccard index be-
tween the reference and the predicted entity, which
measures the accuracy of the boundaries of the
predicted entity (Bossy et al, 2012). W is a param-
eter that defines the semantic similarity between
the ontology concepts related to the reference en-
tity and to the predicted entity (Wang et al, 2007).
This similarity is based on the is-a relationships
between concepts, and used for penalizing ances-
tor/descendent predictions more compared to sib-
ling predictions as it approaches to 1.
S = J ?W (2)
For Sub-task 2, precision, recall, and f-score
metrics are used for evaluation. In the following
subsections, our official evaluation results for Sub-
task 1 and Sub-task 2 are given.
5.1 Results of Sub-task 1
Our official evaluation results on test set are shown
in Table 4. Our system ranked second according to
the SER value among four participating systems in
the shared task.
The official results of our system on the test set
for entity boundary detection are shown in Table 5.
Our system obtained the smallest SER value for
detecting the entity boundaries (i.e., the best per-
formance) among the other participating systems.

tem ranked second on the main evaluation where
the parameter w (described in Section 5) was set
to 0.65. As shown in the table, as the w value in-
creases, our results get better. According to the of-
ficial results, our system ranked first for w = 1 with
the highest f-score, and our SER result is same as
the best system for w = 0.8.
The parameter w can can be seen as a penal-
ization value for the false concept references. As
w increases, the false references to distant ances-
tors and descendants of the true reference concepts
are penalized more, whereas as w decreases the
false references to the siblings are penalized more
severely.
The results also show that our system is able to
achieve balanced precision and recall values. In
other words, the recall and precision values are
close to each other.

6 Conclusion
In this study, we presented two systems that are
implemented in the scope of the BioNLP Shared
Task 2013 - Bacteria Biotope Task. The aim of
the Sub-task 1 system is the identification of habi-
tat mentions in unstructured biomedical text and
their normalization through the OntoBiotope on-
tology, whereas the goal of the Sub-task 2 system
is the extraction of localization and part-of rela-
tions between bacteria and habitats when the enti-
ties are given. Both systems are based on syntactic
rules designed by considering the shallow syntac-
tic analysis of the text, while the Sub-task 2 system
also makes use of discourse-based rules.
According to the official evaluation, both of our
systems achieved promising results on the shared
task test data set. Based on the main evaluation
where the parameter w is set to 0.65, our Sub-task
1 system ranked second among four participating
systems and it ranked first for predicting the entity
boundaries when ontology categorization outputs
are not considered. The results show that our sys-
tem performs better as w increases and achieves
the best performance when w = 1 and w = 0.8. Our
Sub-task 2 system achieved encouraging results by
ranking first in predicting the PartOf events, and
ranking third when all event types are considered.
The proposed systems can be enhanced by in-
corporating a stemming module and including
more syntax and discourse based rules.
