Abstract
Automated testing of spoken language is the
subject of much current research. Elicited
Imitation (EI), or sentence repetition, is well
suited for automated scoring, but does not di-
rectly test a broad range of speech communi-
cation skills. An Oral Proficiency Interview
(OPI) tests a broad range of skills, but is not as
well suited for automated scoring. Some have
suggested that EI can be used as a predictor of
more general speech communication abilities.
We examine EI for this purpose. A fully au-
tomated EI test is used to predict OPI scores.
Experiments show strong correlation between
predicted and actual OPI scores. Effective-
ness of OPI score prediction depends upon at
least two important design decisions. One of
these decisions is to base prediction primar-
ily on acoustic measures, rather than on tran-
scription. The other of these decisions is the
choice of sentences, or EI test items, to be re-
peated. It is shown that both of these design
decisions can greatly impact performance. It
is also shown that the effectiveness of individ-
ual test items can be predicted.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Learning to speak a second language is an impor-
tant objective for many people. Assessing progress
in oral proficiency is often expensive and time-
consuming. The development of automated systems
promises to significantly lower costs and increase
accessibility.
Elicited imitation (EI) has been used for nearly
half a century to measure abnormal language devel-
opment (Fujiki and Brinton, 1987) and the perfor-
mance of second language learners (Chaudron et al,
2005; Vinther, 2002). As a method for assessing oral
proficiency it consists of a person listening to a test
item, typically a full sentence, and then doing their
best to repeat it back correctly. This method is also
referred to as sentence repetition, or more simply as
repeats. One motivation for using EI, as opposed to
some other form of test, is that it is relatively inex-
pensive to administer. An EI test can be effectively
scored by non-experts in a relatively short amount
of time. It is also well suited for automated scoring
(Graham et al, 2008), since correct responses are
predictable.
1.2 Motivation
The language skills directly measured by an EI test
are those involved in repeating back what one has
just heard. In order to directly measure a broader set
of language skills, other tests must be used. One of
these is the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI).
The OPI is face-to-face interview conducted to as-
sess language proficiency. The interview tests dif-
ferent types of relevant skills and lasts for about 30
minutes. Additionally, a validated OPI requires a
second review of a recording created during the ini-
tial interview with arbitration if necessary. This pro-
cess is expensive ( $150 U.S.) and time-consuming
with a turn-around of several weeks before finalized
results are received.
A fully automated OPI test does not seem to be
practical. This is especially the case when the in-
30
terpersonal aspects of a face-to-face interview are
considered. There have been several efforts to au-
tomatically score the type of speech which might be
spoken by an OPI test-taker, spontaneous non-native
speech (Zechner and Xi, 2008). It has been shown
that current automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems, used to transcribe such speech, have error
rates which make it challenging to use transcripts for
testing purposes.
The argument has been made that although EI
does not directly measure communicative skills,
such as the ability to converse with another person,
it can be used to infer such skills (Henning, 1983).
Part of the theory behind EI is that people typically
are not able to memorize the sounds of an utterance
the length of a full sentence. Rather, people build
a mental model of the meaning of an utterance, and
are then able to remember the model. People who
cannot understand the utterance are not able to build
a mental model, and are therefore unable to remem-
ber or repeat the utterance. If it is true that EI can
be used to infer more general speech communica-
tion abilities, even if only to a limited extent, then
EI may be useful for predicting test scores which are
designed to directly measure that ability.
Bernstein et al (2000) describe a system which
elicits short predictable responses, such as readings,
repeats (EI), opposites, and short answers, for auto-
mated testing. A similar system is discussed later
in Bernstein et al (2010). It is evident that EI is
used in these systems, as part of a greater whole.
The argument is made that although the skills di-
rectly tested are limited, the scores produced may be
useful for inferring more general language abilities.
It is shown that automated scores correlate well with
scores from conventional tests, such as the OPI. One
aspect which may not be as clear is the role that EI
plays as compared to other methods used in the au-
tomated test.
We are interested in the use of a fully automated
EI test as a means to predict more general ability
in spoken language communication. Since the OPI
test is specifically designed to measure such general
ability we use it as a gold standard, in spite of the
fact that we do not expect it to be a perfect measure.
We are interested in learning the extent to which OPI
scores can be predicted using an EI test. We are also
interested in learning how to design an automated
system such that prediction of OPI scores is most
effective. We evaluate system performance based on
how highly correlated OPI score predictions are with
actual OPI scores.
Several design decisions must be made in the de-
velopment of such a system. One, is which method
to use for converting spoken responses to OPI score
predictions. Another, is the choice of sentences, or
EI test items, to be repeated. We address both of
these issues.
There are at least two approaches to scoring spo-
ken responses. One, is to score based on tran-
scriptions, generated by a speech recognizer. An-
other, is to score based on acoustic measures alone,
such as pronunciation and fluency (Cincarek et al,
2009). The primary difference between these two
approaches is what is assumed about the textual con-
tent of a spoken response. Acoustic measures are
based on the assumption that the textual content of
each spoken response is known. Speech recognition
is based on the assumption that the content is not
known. We explore the effect of this assumption on
OPI prediction.
The selection of effective EI test items has been
the subject of some research. Tomita et al (2009)
outline principles for creating effective EI test items.
Christensen et al (2010) present a tool for test item
creation. We explore the use of OPI scores as a
means to evaluate the effectiveness of individual test
items.
2 Related Work
The system described by Bernstein et al (2010) uses
EI as part of the automated test. Sentences range
in length from two to twenty or more syllables. If
fewer than 90% of natives can repeat the sentence
verbatim, then the item is not used. An augmented
ASR system is used which has been optimized for
non-native speech. The ASR system is used to tran-
scribe test-taker responses. Transcriptions are com-
pared to the word string recited in the prompt. Word
errors are counted and used to calculate a score. Flu-
ency and pronunciation of spoken responses are also
scored.
Graham et al (2008) report on a system which
uses EI for automated assessment. Results show that
automated scores are strongly correlated with man-
31
ual EI scores. ASR grammars are specific to each
test item. Our work is based on this system.
Mu?ller et al (2009) compare the effectiveness of
reading and repeating (EI) tasks for automated test-
ing. Automated scores are compared with manual
scores for the same task. It is found that repeating
tasks provide a better means of automatic assess-
ment than reading tasks.
3 Experiments
In this section we describe experiments, including
both an OPI test and an automated EI test. We de-
tail the manner of automated scoring of the EI test,
together with the method used to predict OPI scores.
3.1 Setup
We administer an ACTFL-OPI (see www.actfl.org)
and an automated EI test to each of 85 English as
a Foreign Language learners of varying proficiency
levels. This group of speakers (test-takers) is ran-
domly divided into a 70%/30% training/testing split,
with 60 speakers forming the training set and the re-
maining 25 forming the test set. Training data con-
sists of OPI scores and EI responses for each speaker
in the training set. Test data consists of OPI scores
and EI responses for each speaker in the test set.
An OPI is a face-to-face interview conducted by
a skilled, certified human evaluator. (We do not ex-
pect that this interview results in an ideal evaluation
of oral proficiency. We use the OPI because it is de-
signed to directly test speech communication skills
which are not directly tested by EI.) OPI proficiency
levels range across a 10-tiered nominal scale from
Novice Low to Superior. We convert these levels to
an integer score from 1 to 10 (NoviceLow = 1,
Superior = 10).
The EI test consists of 59 items, each an English
sentence. An automated system plays a recording of
each sentence and then records the speaker?s attempt
to repeat the sentence verbatim. A fixed amount of
time is allotted for the speaker to repeat the sentence.
After that fixed time, the next item is presented, until
all items are presented and all responses recorded.
The choice of which items to include in the test is
somewhat arbitrary; we select those items which we
believe might work well, given past experimentation
with EI. We expect that improvement could be made
in both the manner of administration of the test, and
in the selection of test items.
Responses are scored using a Sphinx 4 (Walker
et al, 2004) ASR system, version 1.0 beta 4, to-
gether with the supplied 30-6800HZ WSJ acoustic
model. ASR performance is affected by various sys-
tem parameters. For our experiments, we generally
use default parameters found in configuration files
for Sphinx demos. The ASR system has not been
adapted for non-native speech.
3.2 Language Models
We vary the language model component of the ASR
system in order to evaluate the merit of assum-
ing that the content of spoken responses is known.
Speech recognizers use both an acoustic model and
a language model, to transcribe text. The acoustic
model is used to estimate a probability correspond-
ing to how well input speech sounds like output text.
The language model is used to estimate a probabil-
ity corresponding to how well output text looks like
a target language, such as English. Output text is
determined based on a joint probability, using both
the acoustic and the language models. We vary the
degree to which it is assumed that the content of spo-
ken responses is known. This is done by varying the
degree to which the language model is constrained
to the text of the expected response.
When the language model is fully constrained, the
assumption is made that the content of each spoken
response is known. The language model assigns all
probability to the text of the expected response. All
other output text has zero probability. The acoustic
model estimates a probability for this word sequence
according to how well the test item is pronounced. If
the joint probability of the word sequence is below
a certain rejection threshold, then there is no out-
put from the speech recognizer. Otherwise, the text
of the test item is the output of the speech recog-
nizer. With this fully constrained language model,
the speech recognizer is essentially a binary indica-
tor of pronunciation quality.
When the language model is fully unconstrained,
there is no relationship between the language model
and test items, except that test items belong to the
English language. In this case, the speech recognizer
functions normally, as a means to transcribe spoken
responses. Output text is the best guess of the ASR
32
system as to what was said.
A partially constrained language model is one that
is based on test items, but also allows variation in
output text.
We perform experiments using the following five
language models:
1. WSJ20K The 20K word Wall Street Journal
language model, supplied with Sphinx.
2. WSJ5K The 5K word Wall Street Journal lan-
guage model, supplied with Sphinx.
3. EI Items A custom language model created
from the corpus of all test items.
4. Item Selection A custom language model con-
straining output to any one of the test items.
5. Forced Alignment A custom language model
constraining output to only the current test
item.
The first two language models, WSJ20K and
WSJ5K, are supplied with Sphinx and have no spe-
cial relationship to the test items. The training cor-
pus used to build these models is drawn from issues
of the Wall Street Journal. These models are fully
unconstrained.
The third model, EI Items, is a conventional lan-
guage model with the exception that the training cor-
pus is very limited. The training corpus consists of
all test items; no other text is included in the train-
ing corpus. The fourth model, Item Selection, is not
a conventional language model. It assigns a set prob-
ability to each test item as a whole. That probability
is equal to one divided by the total number of test
items. Such a simple language model is sometimes
referred to as a grammar (Walker et al, 2004; Gra-
ham et al, 2008). Both the EI Items and Item Selec-
tion models are partially constrained. The Item Se-
lection model is much more highly constrained than
the EI Items model.
The last model, Forced Alignment, is fully con-
strained. It assigns all probability to item text. These
five language models are chosen for the purpose of
evaluating the effectiveness of constraining the lan-
guage model to the text of the expected response.

Figure 1: Notation used in this paper.
3.3 Scoring
Each response is scored using a two-step process.
First, the spoken response is transcribed by the ASR
system. Second, word error rate (WER) is calcu-
lated by comparing the transcription to the item text.
WER is converted to an item score xis for item i and
speaker s in the range of 0 to 1 using the following
formula:
xis =
{
1? WER100 if WER < 100%
0 otherwise
(1)
A list of notation used in this paper is shown in
Figure 1.
3.4 Prediction
In order to avoid over-fitting, a simple linear model
is trained (Witten and Frank, 2005) to predict an OPI
score ys, given items scores xis together with model
parameters a and b. The mean of item scores for
speaker s is multiplied by parameter a. This product
plus parameter b is the OPI score prediction: (I is
the total number of items.)
ys =
1
I
?
i
xis ? a + b (2)
Correlation is calculated between predicted and
actual OPI scores for all speakers in the test set.
4 Results
Correlation for each of the language models using
all 59 test items is shown in Figure 2. Correlation for
both of the unconstrained language models was rel-
atively poor. Performance improved significantly as
the language model was constrained to the expected
response. These results suggest that it is effective
33
to assume that the content of spoken responses is
known.
Fully constraining the language model to the text
of the expected response results in an item score
which is a binary indicator (because, in this case,
WER is either 100% or 0%) of how well the spoken
response sounds like the expected response. In this
case, prediction is based on the output of the acous-
tic model of the speech recognizer, an acoustic mea-
sure. Prediction is not based on transcription, since
a specific transcription is assumed prior to process-
ing the spoken response. When the language model
is fully unconstrained, an item score is an indica-
tor of how well ASR transcription matches the text
of the expected response. In this case, prediction is
based on transcription, the speech recognizer?s best
guess of which words were spoken. Results indicate
that correlation between predicted and actual OPI
scores improves as prediction is based on acoustic
measures, rather than on transcription.

4.1 Item MSE
The effectiveness of individual test items is explored
by defining a measure of item quality. If each item
score xis were ideally linearly correlated with the
actual OPI score os for speaker s then the equality
shown below would hold: (os is an integer from 1 to
10. xis is a real number from 0 to 1.)
IDEAL =? os = xis ? 9 + 1 (3)
We calculate the difference between this ideal and
the actual OPI score:
(xis ? 9 + 1)? os (4)
This difference can be seen as a measure of how
useful the item is as a predictor OPI scores. For bet-
ter items, this difference is closer to zero. The mean
of the squares of these differences for a particular
item, over all S speakers in the training set, is a mea-
sure of item quality MSEi:
MSEi =
1
S
?
s
((xis ? 9 + 1)? os)
2 (5)
Because we expect improved results by assuming
that the content of expected responses is known, we
use the Forced Alignment language model to cal-
culate an MSE score for each test item. A sample
of items and their associated MSE are listed in Fig-
ure 3.

Figure 3: Sample EI items with corresponding MSE
scores.
Item MSE scores are used to define various sub-
sets of test items, better items, worse items, and so
on. Better items have lower MSE scores. These sub-
sets are used to compute a series of correlations for
each of the five language models. First, correlation
is computed using only one test item. That item is
the item with the lowest (best) MSE score. Then,
correlation is computed again using only two test
items, the two items with the lowest MSE scores.
This process is repeated until correlation is com-
puted using all test items. Results are shown in Fig-
ure 4. These results show even more convincingly
that OPI prediction improves by assuming that the
content of spoken responses is known.
4.2 OPI Prediction
Figure 4 also gives an idea of how effectively EI can
be used to predict OPI scores. Correlation over 0.80
is achieved using the Forced Alignment language

models, using varying numbers of test items.

model for all but 7 of the 59 subsets of test items.
Correlation is over 0.84 for 11 of the subsets (best
20 - best 31). Correlation is above 0.85 for 3 subsets
(best 23 - best 25). Predicted OPI scores correlate
strongly with actual OPI scores.
Figure 5 shows a plot of predicted OPI scores as
a function of actual OPI scores, using the Forced
Alignment language model and only the best 24 test
items. Correlation is 0.856. Interestingly, two of the
outliers (OPI=5, predicted OPI=2.3) and (OPI=4,
predicted OPI=2.3) were for speakers whose re-
sponses contained only silence, indicating those par-
ticipants may have experienced technical difficulties
or may have been uncooperative during their test
session. The inferred model used to calculate OPI
predictions for Figure 5 is shown below:
ys =
1
I
?
i
xis ? 6.8 + 2.3 (6)
(Given this particular model, the lowest possible
predicted OPI score is 2.3, and the highest possible
predicted score is 9.1. The ability to predict OPI
scores 1 and 10 is lost, but the objective is to improve
overall correlation.)
4.3 Item Selection
To see more clearly the effect that the choice of test
items has on OPI prediction, we compute a series
of correlations similar to before, except that the or-
der of test items is reversed: First, correlation is
computed using only the test item with the high-
est (worst) MSE score. Then, correlation is com-
puted again using only the two worst items, and so
on. This series of correlations is computed for the
Forced Alignment language model only. It is shown
together with the original ordering for the Forced
Alignment language model from Figure 4.
These two series are shown in Figure 6. The se-
ries with generally high correlation is computed us-
ing best items first. The series with generally low
correlation is computed using worst items first. At
the end of both series all items are used, and corre-
lation is the same. As mentioned earlier, correlation
using only the best 24 items is 0.856. By contrast,
correlation using only the worst 24 items is 0.679.
The choice of test items can have a significant im-
pact on OPI score prediction.
Figure 6 also shows that the effectiveness of in-
dividual test items can be predicted. MSE scores
were calculated using only training data. Correla-
tions were calculated for test data.
4.4 Rejection Threshold
Since the Forced Alignment language model is
found to be so effective, we experiment further to
learn more about its behavior. Using this language
model, item scores are either zero or one, depending
upon whether ASR output text is the same as item
text, or there is no output text. If joint probability,
for a spoken response, is below a certain rejection
threshold, no text is output. We perform experiments
35

ference between best and worst items, using the Forced
Alignment language model.

threshold.
to see how sensitive OPI predictions are to the set-
ting of this threshold.
Any ASR system parameter which affects prob-
ability estimates of word sequences can affect the
rejection threshold. We make the arbitrary deci-
sion to vary the Sphinx relativeBeamWidth pa-
rameter. For all previous experiments, the value
of this parameter was fixed at 1E ? 90. The
wordInsertionProbability parameter, which also
affects the rejection threshold, was fixed at 1E?36.
Correlation is computed for various values of
the relativeBeamWidth parameter. Results are
shown in Figure 7. Good results are obtained over
a wide range of rejection thresholds. Correlation
peaks at 1E? 80. OPI prediction does not appear to
be overly sensitive to the setting of this threshold.
5 Discussion
We conclude that a fully-automated EI test can be
used to effectively predict more general language
ability than those abilities which are directly tested
by EI. Such an EI test is used to predict the OPI
scores of 25 test-takers. Correlation between pre-
dicted and actual OPI scores is strong.
Effectiveness of OPI score prediction depends
upon at least two important design decisions. One
of these decisions is to base prediction primarily on
acoustic measures, rather than on transcription. The
other of these decisions is the choice of sentences,
or EI test items, to be repeated. It is shown that both
of these design decisions can greatly impact perfor-
mance. It is also shown that the effectiveness of in-
dividual test items can be predicted.
We quantify the effectiveness of individual test
items using item MSE. It may be possible to use
item MSE to learn more about the characteristics
of effective EI test items. Developing more effec-
tive test items may lead to improved prediction of
OPI test scores. In this paper, we do not attempt
to address how linguistic factors (such as sentence
length, syntactic complexity, lexical difficulty, and
morphology) affect test item effectiveness for OPI
prediction. However, others have discussed simi-
lar questions (Tomita et al, 2009; Christensen et al,
2010).
It may be possible that a test-taker could learn
strategies for doing well on an EI test, without de-
veloping more general speech communication skills.
If test-takers were able to learn such strategies, it
may affect the usefulness of EI tests. Bernstein et al
(2010) suggest that, as yet, no conclusive evidence
has been presented on this issue, and that automated
test providers welcome such research.
It is possible that other automated systems are
found to be more effective as a means for testing
speech communication skills, or as a means for pre-
dicting OPI scores. We expect this to be the case.
The purpose of this research is not to design the best
possible system. Rather, it is to improve understand-
ing of how such a system might be designed. It is
shown that an EI test can be used as a key compo-
nent of such a system. Strong correlation between
actual and predicted OPI scores is achieved without
using any other language testing method.
