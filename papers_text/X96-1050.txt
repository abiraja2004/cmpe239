Introduction* 
Japanese was one of the languages selected for 
evaluation of named entity identification algorithms in 
the TIPSTER-sponsored Multilingual Entity Task 
(MET) program. As with the Spanish and Chinese 
groups (Table 1), Japanese systems automatically marked 
the names of organizations, people, and places within 
entity name xpressions (ENAMEX), dates and times 
within time expressions (TIMEX), and percents and 
money within number expressions (NUMEX). The 
participant Japanese systems were developed in a four- 
month period of time and output results comparable to
the Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) \[1\] 
English language systems with F-Measures between 70 - 
90% \[21.

The Corpus 
Since MET was designed to tackle the MUC-6 
named entity task in foreign languages, the government 
needed to acquire acorpus of articles rich in references to
people, places, and organizations. A search of Kyodo 
newswire data using the keyword "~.~. , "  
(press conference) yielded the desired 100-article 
development and 100-article test corpora. In the test 
corpus, 71% of the tags were of the ENAMEX type; that 
is, the tagged items were references toorganizations, 
people, and places (Table 2). By conU:ast, for example, 
the 150-article TIPSTER Phase I test corpus contained 
only 75 instances of person names, or just 1% of all 
corpus tags \[3\].

Table 2: Distribution of Tag Types 
Human Performance 
One motivation for conducting the named entity task 
in a foreign language such as Japanese was to promote 
techniques for tackling language-specific d fficulties in 
recognizing the names of people and organizations. 
Unlike English, Japanese cannot rely upon orthographic 
clues like capitalization toidentify proper nouns. For 
this reason, and based upon the authors' own manual 
tagging experience, we felt that identification of
ENAMEX types would be the most challenging to the 
participant systems. (See Hard Tag Type below) 
The government MET Japanese team was accorded 
the opportunity o test this hypothesis dunng the course 
of preparing dry-run keys for the initial systems test in 
early April. Each of us manually tagged the same 25 
articles, then looked at the resulting annotator variation. 
The discrepancies between the two sets of tagged ata 
were discussed and resolved. The final product formed 
ground truth or the keys against which the automatic 
participant systems were scored. Each of our original 
manually tagged versions was also scored against the 
keys. The figures in Table 3 are similar due to the small 
number of articles and lack of degradation i  human 
performance over the short period of time it took for each 
of us to tag (average: <5 minutes per article). 
Nonetheless, the ORGANIZATION and LOCATION 
subtypes were the most prone to error.

Table 4 shows the group average F-Measures for the

the relative difficulty of identifying ENAMEX types -- 
people, places, and organizations -- was borne out.

Table 4: Systems Performance 
Easy Tag Types: NUMEX & T IMEX 
and TIME were also limited. Typically, MONEY was 
specified by an Arabic numeral + a monetary unit in 
katakana, e.g., "2  ~ Iz/P '' ($200 million). The 
occasional mistake made by the systems involved not 
identifying a monetary unit other than the predominant 
dollar or yen such as "7~ ~ \]?" (British pound). 
TIME expressions were also straightforward in their 
manner of representation. Examples of valid tags 
included "0930," ~"  (morning), "zt:~-~ 5 I~,~" 
(5 PM), etc. An anomalous string such as 
"zt:~lt ,~'~" g (past midnight), in which 
the kanji "~"  was used rather than the numeral "0," 
caused problems for some systems. 
DATE 
The Japanese participant systems processed DATE 
expressions successfully despite the denmnds made by the 
MET Japanese Guidelines \[4\] concerning what should be 
tagged and the wealth of patterns used to represent those 
expressions. In addition to absolute DATEs such as 
"2 6 I~" (26th) and "~\ [~"  (Tuesday) 
MET Guidelines tipulated that relative DATEs such as 
"~ 7 ~"  (next year July) were to be 
identified as well. 
While the entity name expressions were relatively 
difficult o handle, the number (NUMEX) and time 
(TIMEX) expressions encompassing the tag subtypes 
PERCENT & MONEY and TIME & DATE, 
respectively, were handled proficiently by the participant 
systems. As Table 4 shows, the group average F- 
Measure for these tag types was over 90% on the test 
d~!a 
PERCENT 
As in English, the typical Japanese contextual 
pattern for generating a valid PERCENT tag was an 
Arabic numeral + the "%" sign, e.g., "70%." The fact 
that the systems collectively scored less than 100% 
(96%) indicates that this pattern was not universal. 
Indeed, the Japanese development and test articles 
represented percentages in various other ways such as an 
Arabic numeral + the kanji (Chinese character) for 
percent" 7 ~|;" an Arabic numeral + the katakana 
(foreign loan-word script) for percent, e.g., 
" 7 0 ~- -~ ~, ;" and a kanji numeral + 
the kanji for percent, e.g., "-tS-~lJ." In addition, the 
MET Japanese Guidelines \[4\] stipulated that fractions 
such as " 1 0 ~0D--"  (1/10), which are easily 
calculable as percentages, should also be identified. 
Although the above-mentioned patterns are more varied 
than what one typically encounters in English texts, they 
nevertheless constitute a standard finite list which the 
participant systems processed well. 
MONEY and TIME 
The contextual patterns manifested in the 
development and test corpora for representing MONEY 
The requirement for tagging relative dates, 
furthermore, introduced to this task a class of Japanese 
semantic attachments that complicated the identification 
process. Whereas "~l~" (next, coming) and "~"  
(last) are in the initial position of the phrases "~"  
(next year) and "~1~" (last year), other semantic 
attachments such as "~"  (end o0 or "~/J~" (early, 
beginning of), which add semantic ontent to the DATE 
expression and are, therefore, integral parts of the DATE 
tag, are in the postposition of phrases. Examples are 
"~ ~"  (end of the month) and" 5 Yl ~TJ ~"  
(early May). It was not uncommon, therefore, to 
encounter in these texts semantic-laden relative DATE 
expressions containing both prepositions and 
postpositions, e.g., "~1 z 3 ~ ~"  (end of 
March next year). In the end, the Japanese systems 
identified DATEs with an extensive number of different 
semantic attachments at the average rate of 94%. 
Hard Tag Type: ENAMEX 
LOCATION 
LOCATION expressions were typified by entities 
that likely would be contained in a gazetteer o  similar 
on-line resource. References to "-'f ~ ~ ~--/1/" 
(Israel) or "~ \[~" (U.S.) for example were readily 
identified by the systems. Other semantic lues such as 
the locative designators "~"  (prefecture) or"'}H" 
(state) assisted in recognizing more obscure place names. 
This task was complicated, however, by the 
prevalence ofembedded I_OCATION elements within 
ORGANIZATION expressions and the effects of context 
upon tag type. References to LOCATION frequently 
450 
appeared within phrases that might or might not 
subsume the LOCATION under another tag. For 
instance, "U.S.-Japan trade negotiations" would be an 
event not captured by a singular tag, but by two 
LOCATION tags for U.S. and Japan. However, the 
reference to "~"  (U.S.)in "~ ~,J~;-~'" (U.S. 
Dept. of State) was considered an integral part of the 
ORGANIZATION name and not, therefore, segmented 
and tagged separately. Determining when to segment and 
not segment the place sub-component was a 
complicating factor in producing the proper tag type. 
Furthermore, a correctly identified ORGANIZATION 
such as "\[~l~" (Diet) was directed by the Guidelines 
to be tagged as LOCATION when the context in which it 
was used indicated that he Diet was a facility or structure 
-- i.e., if a press conference were being held there. The 
inability of systems to handle this complex contextual 
shift lowered the group F-Measure average for 
LOCATION. 
PERSON 
Although there is no ready-made on-line resource for 
person ames like a gazetteer for place names, (and even 
if there were, its enormous size would slow substantially 
processing speed), valid PERSON expressions often 
contain people designators in the form of rifles, roles, or 
positions uch as "~"  (Mr.), "~"  (chairman), or 
"~ JE~"  (president) like in 
".Lx,,~  # :J~z~J~" (President Mubarak). 
And, although the number of different designators 
manifested throughout the corpora was sizable, the 
participant systems identified well person ames 
occurring in this type of pattem. 
There were, however, other patterns in evidence 
which conflicted with the predominant one. Preeminent 
among these alternate patterns was the expression i
which a rifle/position designator was preceded by both a 
PERSON and LOCATION, e.g., 
" ,z , , ,~ ~, ~7 ~ 1- ~k~"  
(literally: Mubarak Egypt President). Systems typically 
tagged the entire phrase preceding the title -- Mubarak 
Egypt -- as PERSON, or Egypt alone as LOCATION. 
Therefore, the person ame was either mistagged ornot 
tagged at all. 
ORGANIZATION 
Identifying and categorizing complex noun phrases 
in strings where there is no capitalization a d whitespace 
make this type of expression the most difficult o process 
(group F-Measure average 73%). Normally, the 
corporate designator "~"  (Co., Corp.) would assist in 
identifying an ORGANIZATION. However, the MET 
domain focused on political rather than commercial 
entities, so there were very few instances of this 
designator. And, although bureaucratic descriptors like 
"~'" indicate Japanese ministries, often well-known 
ministries uch as "~l~_J~'" (MITI) are aliased 
(~l~_J~) without mention of the canonical form. 
451 
In addition, the most prevalent entities properly 
identified as ORGANIZATION in these texts included 
groups, offices, labs, etc. -- that is, noun phrases which 
could be proper nouns depending upon context. For 
example, "~ ~SEJ~" could be the name of a 
particular factory, Miyata Factory, or a generic factory 
located in Miyata; similarly, " J~ / i :~ / i~"  
could be the New Hyogo Bank, the new (e.g., rebuilt) 
Hyogo Bank, or a new Hyogo Bank (i.e., one bank in the 
Hyogo Bank chain). 
To complicate matters further, once a complex NP 
like "~.~_ j~.~.~/ Jx~"  (MITI 
Telecommunications Subcommittee) is determined tobe 
a proper noun, the systems next were required to tag as 
ORGANIZATION each constituent part of the 
hierarchical relationship expressed within the phrase. In 
this case, there were two: MITI (parent) and 
Telecommunications Subcommittee (child). 
Summary 
The Japanese systems showed excellent overall 
results despite avery compressed development cycle. 
They handled comparatively easy types of expressions 
with a high -- >90% -- degree of accuracy, and the hard 
expressions with surprising proficiency, thereby 
promising marked improvement i  the near term and the 
capability to work in conjunction with other language 
processing technologies such as Machine Translation 
(MT) and text summadzarion \[5\].
