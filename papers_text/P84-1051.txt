ABSTRACT 
Various typologies of technical and 
seientifical texts nave already been proposeO 
bv authors involved in multilingual transfer 
problems. They were usually aimed at a better 
knowledge of the criteria for deciding if a 
document has to be or can be machine trans- 
lated. Such a typology could also lead to a 
better knowledge of the typical errors oc- 
curing, and so lead to more appropriate 
post-editing, as well as to improvements in 
the system. 
Raw translations being usable, as they 
are quite often for rapid information needs, 
it is important to draw the limits between a 
style adequate for rapid information, and an 
elegant, high qualitv style such as required 
for information large dissemination. Style 
could be given a new definition through a 
linguistic analysis based on machine trans- 
lation, on communication situations and on 
the users' requirements and satisfaction. 
I .  MACHINE TRANSLATION AND POST-EDITING, 
A EUROPEAN EXAMPLE 
Machine translation is often considered 
as a project, an experimental process, if not 
an impossible dream. Translation theoreti- 
clans would sav no machine can understand the 
meaning of a text and re-express it in an 
other language, so no machine can translate. 
The debate is about the necessity of a deep 
semantic understanding for translating, 
opposed to a language structure knowledge to 
be sufficient to produce a translation. The 
usual debate is thus about the ideal concept 
each one has of what a translation should be. 
Translation can only be defined in 
particular situations, regarding particular 
documents. And machine translation is only to 
be used for certain types of documents to be 
handled a certain way. 
HY observat ions  are based on severa l  
s tud ies  I car r ied  out on the SYSTRAN output  
produced in  Luxembourg w i th in  the Commission 
o f  the European Communit ies. 
In Luxembourg the amount of documents to 
be translated is not only very big, it is 
also growing very fast. The european rule is 
that all official documents have to be 
translated into the seven official languages; 
technical documents needed for conferences or 
experts meetings are sometimes translated 
only in three or four languages (english, 
french, german, italian). The delay available 
is often very short. That led the C.E.C. 
General Direction for Multilingual Transfers 
to promote machine translation. When they 
started it, some six years ago, SYSTRAN was 
the only system ready to produce transla- 
tions. This system, originated in the U.S., 
has then been developed for the proper use of 
the Commission. 
The output was far from being perfect, 
far from being usable as it was. Post-editing 
was being done. Even with the huge progress 
of the output quality, post-editing is still 
necessarY. It will, in fact, be always 
necessary because as people get used to their 
translation to be done by a computer, their 
requirements are becoming more precise. The 
errors one would admit at an experimental 
stage, are no more possible at a productive 
stage. 
Post-editing is thus becoming a new 
specialization within the numerous fields 
related to translation. 
I ;  - A TYPOLOGY OF DOCUMENTS 
BASED ON M.T. ERRORS 
All documents are not suitable for 
machine translation. Lots of negative 
reactions against M.T. have been induced by a 
wrong use of M.T. Aware of the necessity of 
differentiating the documents, people res- 
ponsible for translation proposed several 
types of typologies. They were mainly based 
on the subject field of the text, on its 
function, on its structure, on the sentence 
and paragraph length and complexity, on the 
use of particular terminologies. 
236  
The aim was to enable the chief of a 
translation division to choose which texts 
were to be sent to a human translator, and 
which could be processed by M.T. 
My study of the errors remaining in the 
raw translations led me to propose a strictly 
linguistic typology. I 
There are three major tvpes of errors : 
i. errors on isolated words, 
2. errors on the expression of relations, 
3. errors on the structure and on the 
information display. 
These errors are classified in three 
tables : 
i.i vocabulary, terminology 
1.2 proper names and abbreviations, 
1.3 relators : - in nominai groups, 
- in verbai groups, 
1.4 noun determinants, verbal modificators ; 
2.5 verb forms (tense), 
2.6 verb forms (passive/active) and per- 
sonalization (passive/non personai), 
2.7 expression of modaIity or not, 
2.8 negation ; 
3.9 logical relations, phrase introducers, 
\].10 words order, 
3.11 general problems of incidence. 
The relative frequence of these errors 
can be read in my tables. 
These tables can be used to evaluate the 
probable quantity and location of errors 
existing after M.T., i.e. the probable quan- 
tity, location and type of post-editing. With 
a short training in linguistics, anyone 
could get trained to use these tables. By a 
rapid reading of the documents to be transla- 
ted on the basis of these features, and 
according to the relative frequence of one 
category of probable errors or the other, one 
could then easily evaluate if a document 
should be translated by a translator or is 
suitable for M.T. 
I I I  - TYPES OF POST-EDITING 
The system used in Luxembourg is still 
being developped. That means that errors are 
getting fewer. For instance three years ago 
verb forms were translated "form to form", 
now new rules have been introduced in order 
to get a past tense for a present tense (or 
reverse), a passive form for an impersonaI 
one (or reverse), a.s.o. 
i cf. A.M. Loffler-Laurian, Pour une tvpo- 
logie des erreurs dans la traduction automa- 
tique, in MULTiLINGUA, 2-2 (1983), 65-78 
But at the same time the variety of documents 
machine trabslated is growing. That means new 
sources on errors (mainIv vocabulary, but 
aiso modaiities, structures, a.s.o.). 
Post-editing is always necessary. Until 
now post-editing has been done by translators 
who are wishing to do it. The amount of 
post-editing to do is increasing every day, 
it becomes obvious that post-editing can't be 
done just according to somebody's feeling of 
language and style. There has to be some 
rules. 
Post-editing is not revision, nor 
correction, nor rewriting. It is a new way of 
considering a text, a new wav of working on 
it, for a new aim. In order to define the 
characteristics of post-editing, I carried 
out a study on the two major types of post- 
editing as they appear in the C.E.C. 2 
i. The conventional post-editing (C.P.E.) is 
supposed to produce a text as similar as 
possibie to what a human translation would 
have been, that means a high quality 
text. 
2. The rapid post-editing (R.P.E.) is 
supposed to produce a correct text (on the 
language level as well as on the level of 
the meaning) but without taking care of 
the stvie. 
In the experiment I carried out, time 
required for post-editing was the only 
criteria to differenciate these two methods. 
It appeared that special Iinguistical at- 
titudes were induced by time Iimitation. A 
statistical survey of C.P.E. and R.P.E. shows 
the limits between : 
I. necessary post-editing, 
2. possible post-editing, 
3. superfluous post-editing. 
First group includes all post-editing 
that has to be done to make the text under- 
standabie, clear, readable, exact. Second 
group inciudes some research in style focused 
on the adaptation to the communication 
situation, to the author and to the presumed 
reader. Third group is post-editing done bY 
peopIe who didn't want to admit that perfec- 
tion was not the aim, and that a document 
that will be read quickIy and thrown away 
immediateIv ooes not require the same style 
as a oocument that will be pubiished and 
largeiv distributed. These people usuaIly 
could not give out their R.P.E. in the 
limited time allowed for it. 
2 cf. A.M.L.L., Post-~dition conventionnelle t 
post-6dition rapide~ vers une m6thodologie de 
la post-~dition, to be published. 
237 
In rapid post-editing one has to focus 
on the central information, and is naturally 
kept out from the temptation of rewriting the 
sentence were errors occur. Then the post- 
editor finds the shortest solution, which is 
usually the right one. By staying very close 
to the raw translation, post-editors succeed 
in giving a good and acceptable translation. 
Those who, after having post-edited 
according to the minimal requirements, try to 
make the text fit better the usual style they 
know, give us indications to point out the 
difference between : 
- a text that is correct according to 
standard language rules, 
- a text that obeys the usage rules in use on 
that level of documents or level of 
language (some "sub-rules" specific to some 
specialized f ields,  authors, s ituations).  
IV - STYLE, SITUATIONS AND USERS 
Style in literature is usually defined 
as the specific way an author writes. Do 
technical and scientific documents have a 
specific style ? Many people would agree on 
the idea that these documents have no style 
-or have a neutral stYle-. In terms of 
linguistic features, they can be described as 
well as any other writing. However the 
non-apparent aspect of style in informative 
documents is an important component of their 
ability to be machine translated. In a novel, 
the style of the author would be its main 
value whereas in an informative document, the 
transparency of style, its leaving the reader 
unaware of it would be essential. Even more : 
if style were to be felt, the information 
would most probably loose some of its 
accuracy and credibility. 
In every translation situation the 
author has some information to transmit to a 
user. Let it be a technical or a political 
information, a scientific or a social infor- 
mation, the goal may be double : have the 
reader know more about a question (that 
relates to didactics), and have the reader 
react in a specific way to the text. Regar- 
ding this second goal, the best style, most 
adequate, would be the one that would bring 
the reader to the point the author wanted 
him. The neutrality of a computerized system 
is quite fitted to that situation. And the 
minimal post-editing creates often the best 
style. 
The users' satisfaction should be the 
ultimate criterion to evaluate the adequacy 
of a style. 
Are readers getting used to some new 
style based on machine translation ? Some 
people fear for the future of their language: 
it could evolve uncontrolled because of a new 
kind of users getting used to some new 
variety of language induced by a new tool for 
translation. They fear a loss of some 
linguistical property. Languages have always 
been exposed to multiple influences (wars, 
invasions, economical trends, cultural 
exchanges, a.s.o.). They are now exposed to 
technical influences. 
Machine translation is already used by 
translation services. It will certainly be 
soon used by private translators (various 
systems are developped or under development 
in several countries). It could be used with 
great profit by linguists and professors to 
help them think about their own use of 
language, about the varieties of specialized 
uses of language, and about the future 
programmes that could be built up for new 
generations of students.
