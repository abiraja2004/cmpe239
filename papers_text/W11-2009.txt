Successful communication would seem to require that speakers and listeners distinguish between 
their own knowledge, commitments and intentions, and those of their interlocutors. A particu-
larly important distinction is between shared knowledge (common ground) and private knowl-
edge (privileged ground).  Keeping track of what is shared and what is privileged might seem too 
computationally expensive and too memory intensive to inform real-time language processing--a 
position supported by striking experimental evidence that speakers and listeners act egocentri-
cally, showing strong and seemingly inappropriate intrusions from their own privileged ground.  
I?ll review recent results from my laboratory using unscripted conversation demonstrating that 
(1) speaker?s utterances provide evidence about whether they believe information is shared or 
privileged; and (2) addressees are extremely sensitive to this evidence. I?ll suggest an integrative 
framework that explains discrepancies in the literature and might be informative for researchers 
in the computational dialogue community.
