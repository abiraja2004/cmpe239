Abstract
We introduce PARMA, a system for cross-
document, semantic predicate and argu-
ment alignment. Our system combines a
number of linguistic resources familiar to
researchers in areas such as recognizing
textual entailment and question answering,
integrating them into a simple discrimina-
tive model. PARMA achieves state of the
art results on an existing and a new dataset.
We suggest that previous efforts have fo-
cussed on data that is biased and too easy,
and we provide a more difficult dataset
based on translation data with a low base-
line which we beat by 17% F1.
1 Introduction
A key step of the information extraction pipeline
is entity disambiguation, in which discovered en-
tities across many sentences and documents must
be organized to represent real world entities. The
NLP community has a long history of entity dis-
ambiguation both within and across documents.
While most information extraction work focuses
on entities and noun phrases, there have been a
few attempts at predicate, or event, disambigua-
tion. Commonly a situational predicate is taken to
correspond to either an event or a state, lexically
realized in verbs such as ?elect? or nominaliza-
tions such as ?election?. Similar to entity coref-
erence resolution, almost all of this work assumes
unanchored mentions: predicate argument tuples
are grouped together based on coreferent events.
The first work on event coreference dates back to
Bagga and Baldwin (1999). More recently, this
task has been considered by Bejan and Harabagiu
(2010) and Lee et al (2012). As with unanchored
entity disambiguation, these methods rely on clus-
tering methods and evaluation metrics.
Another view of predicate disambiguation seeks
to link or align predicate argument tuples to an ex-
isting anchored resource containing references to
events or actions, similar to anchored entity dis-
ambiguation (entity linking) (Dredze et al, 2010;
Han and Sun, 2011). The most relevant, and per-
haps only, work in this area is that of Roth and
Frank (2012) who linked predicates across docu-
ment pairs, measuring the F1 of aligned pairs.
Here we present PARMA, a new system for pred-
icate argument alignment. As opposed to Roth and
Frank, PARMA is designed as a a trainable plat-
form for the incorporation of the sort of lexical se-
mantic resources used in the related areas of Rec-
ognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) and Question
Answering (QA). We demonstrate the effective-
ness of this approach by achieving state of the art
performance on the data of Roth and Frank despite
having little relevant training data. We then show
that while the ?lemma match? heuristic provides a
strong baseline on this data, this appears to be an
artifact of their data creation process (which was
heavily reliant on word overlap). In response, we
evaluate on a new and more challenging dataset for
predicate argument alignment derived from multi-
ple translation data. We release PARMA as a new
framework for the incorporation and evaluation of
new resources for predicate argument alignment.1
2 PARMA
PARMA (Predicate ARguMent Aligner) is a
pipelined system with a wide variety of features
used to align predicates and arguments in two doc-
uments. Predicates are represented as mention
spans and arguments are represented as corefer-
ence chains (sets of mention spans) provided by
in-document coreference resolution systems such
as included in the Stanford NLP toolkit. Results
indicated that the chains are of sufficient quality
so as not to limit performance, though future work

Figure 1: Example of gold-standard alignment pairs from Roth and Frank?s data set and our data set

where most of the alignments are between identical words like police-police and said-said. The LDC
MTC was constructed to increase lexical diversity, leading to more challenging alignments like veranda-
balcony and tent-camp
may relax this assumption.
We refer to a predicate or an argument as an
?item? with type predicate or argument. An align-
ment between two documents is a subset of all
pairs of items in either documents with the same
type.2 We call the two documents being aligned
the source document S and the target document
T . Items are referred to by their index, and ai,j is a
binary variable representing an alignment between
item i in S and item j in T . A full alignment is an
assignment ~a = {aij : i ? NS , j ? NT }, where
NS and NT are the set of item indices for S and T
respectively.
We train a logistic regression model on exam-
ple alignmentsand maximize the likelihood of a
document alignment under the assumption that the
item alignments are independent. Our objective
is to maximize the log-likelihood of all p(S, T )
with an L1 regularizer (with parameter ?). After
learning model parameters w by regularized max-
imum likelihood on training data, we introducing
a threshold ? on alignment probabilities to get a
classifier. We perform line search on ? and choose
the value that maximizes F1 on dev data. Train-
ing was done using the Mallet toolkit (McCallum,
2002).
2.1 Features
The focus of PARMA is the integration of a diverse
range of features based on existing lexical seman-
tic resources. We built PARMA on a supervised
framework to take advantage of this wide variety
of features since they can describe many different
correlated aspects of generation. The following
features cover the spectrum from high-precision
2Note that type is not the same thing as part of speech: we
allow nominal predicates like ?death?.
to high-recall. Each feature has access to the pro-
posed argument or predicate spans to be linked and
the containing sentences as context. While we use
supervised learning, some of the existing datasets
for this task are very small. For extra training data,
we pool material from different datasets and use
the multi-domain split feature space approach to
learn dataset specific behaviors (Daume?, 2007).
Features in general are defined over mention
spans or head tokens, but we split these features
to create separate feature-spaces for predicates and
arguments.3
For argument coref chains we heuristically
choose a canonical mention to represent each
chain, and some features only look at this canon-
ical mention. The canonical mention is cho-
sen based on length,4 information about the head
word,5 and position in the document.6 In most
cases, coref chains that are longer than one are
proper nouns and the canonical mention is the first
and longest mention (outranking pronominal ref-
erences and other name shortenings).
PPDB We use lexical features from the Para-
phrase Database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al,
2013). PPDB is a large set of paraphrases ex-
tracted from bilingual corpora using pivoting tech-
niques. We make use of the English lexical portion
which contains over 7 million rules for rewriting
terms like ?planet? and ?earth?. PPDB offers a
variety of conditional probabilities for each (syn-
chronous context free grammar) rule, which we

splitting to have no impact on performance.

treat as independent experts. For each of these rule
probabilities (experts), we find all rules that match
the head tokens of a given alignment and have a
feature for the max and harmonic mean of the log
probabilities of the resulting rule set.
FrameNet FrameNet is a lexical database based
on Charles Fillmore?s Frame Semantics (Fill-
more, 1976; Baker et al, 1998). The database
(and the theory) is organized around seman-
tic frames that can be thought of as descrip-
tions of events. Frames crucially include spec-
ification of the participants, or Frame Elements,
in the event. The Destroying frame, for in-
stance, includes frame elements Destroyer or
Cause Undergoer. Frames are related to other
frames through inheritance and perspectivization.
For instance the frames Commerce buy and
Commerce sell (with respective lexical real-
izations ?buy? and ?sell?) are both perspectives of
Commerce goods-transfer (no lexical re-
alizations) which inherits from Transfer (with
lexical realization ?transfer?).
We compute a shortest path between headwords
given edges (hypernym, hyponym, perspectivized
parent and child) in FrameNet and bucket by dis-
tance to get features. We also have a binary feature
for whether two tokens evoke the same frame.
TED Alignments Given two predicates or argu-
ments in two sentences, we attempt to align the
two sentences they appear in using a Tree Edit
Distance (TED) model that aligns two dependency
trees, based on the work described by (Yao et al,
2013). We represent a node in a dependency tree
with three fields: lemma, POS tag and the type
of dependency relation to the node?s parent. The
TED model aligns one tree with the other using
the dynamic programming algorithm of Zhang and
Shasha (1989) with three predefined edits: dele-
tion, insertion and substitution, seeking a solution
yielding the minimum edit cost. Once we have
built a tree alignment, we extract features for 1)
whether the heads of the two phrases are aligned
and 2) the count of how many tokens are aligned
in both trees.
WordNet WordNet (Miller, 1995) is a database
of information (synonyms, hypernyms, etc.) per-
taining to words and short phrases. For each entry,
WordNet provides a set of synonyms, hypernyms,
etc. Given two spans, we use WordNet to deter-
mine semantic similarity by measuring how many
synonym (or other) edges are needed to link two
terms. Similar words will have a short distance.
For features, we find the shortest path linking the
head words of two mentions using synonym, hy-
pernym, hyponym, meronym, and holonym edges
and bucket the length.
String Transducer To represent similarity be-
tween arguments that are names, we use a stochas-
tic edit distance model. This stochastic string-to-
string transducer has latent ?edit? and ?no edit?
regions where the latent regions allow the model
to assign high probability to contiguous regions of
edits (or no edits), which are typical between vari-
ations of person names. In an edit region, param-
eters govern the relative probability of insertion,
deletion, substitution, and copy operations. We
use the transducer model of Andrews et al (2012).
Since in-domain name pairs were not available, we
picked 10,000 entities at random from Wikipedia
to estimate the transducer parameters. The entity
labels were used as weak supervision during EM,
as in Andrews et al (2012).
For a pair of mention spans, we compute the
conditional log-likelihood of the two mentions go-
ing both ways, take the max, and then bucket to get
binary features. We duplicate these features with
copies that only fire if both mentions are tagged as
PER, ORG or LOC.
3 Evaluation
We consider three datasets for evaluating PARMA.
For richer annotations that include lemmatiza-
tions, part of speech, NER, and in-doc corefer-
ence, we pre-processed each of the datasets using
tools7 similar to those used to create the Annotated
Gigaword corpus (Napoles et al, 2012).
Extended Event Coreference Bank Based on
the dataset of Bejan and Harabagiu (2010), Lee et
al. (2012) introduced the Extended Event Coref-
erence Bank (EECB) to evaluate cross-document
event coreference. EECB provides document clus-
ters, within which entities and events may corefer.
Our task is different from Lee et al but we can
modify the corpus setup to support our task. To
produce source and target document pairs, we se-
lect the first document within every cluster as the
source and each of the remaining documents as
target documents (i.e. N ? 1 pairs for a cluster
of size N ). This yielded 437 document pairs.
Roth and Frank The only existing dataset for
our task is from Roth and Frank (2012) (RF), who

annotated documents from the English Gigaword
Fifth Edition corpus (Parker et al, 2011). The data
was generated by clustering similar news stories
from Gigaword using TF-IDF cosine similarity of
their headlines. This corpus is small, containing
only 10 document pairs in the development set and
60 in the test set. To increase the training size,
we train PARMA with 150 randomly selected doc-
ument pairs from both EECB and MTC, and the
entire dev set from Roth and Frank using multi-
domain feature splitting. We tuned the threshold
? on the Roth and Frank dev set, but choose the
regularizer ? based on a grid search on a 5-fold
version of the EECB dataset.
Multiple Translation Corpora We constructed
a new predicate argument alignment dataset
based on the LDC Multiple Translation Corpora
(MTC),8 which consist of multiple English trans-
lations for foreign news articles. Since these mul-
tiple translations are semantically equivalent, they
provide a good resource for aligned predicate ar-
gument pairs. However, finding good pairs is a
challenge: we want pairs with significant overlap
so that they have predicates and arguments that
align, but not documents that are trivial rewrites
of each other. Roth and Frank selected document
pairs based on clustering, meaning that the pairs
had high lexical overlap, often resulting in mini-
mal rewrites of each other. As a result, despite ig-
noring all context, their baseline method (lemma-
alignment) worked quite well.
To create a more challenging dataset, we se-
lected document pairs from the multiple transla-
tions that minimize the lexical overlap (in En-
glish). Because these are translations, we know
that there are equivalent predicates and arguments
in each pair, and that any lexical variation pre-
serves meaning. Therefore, we can select pairs
with minimal lexical overlap in order to create
a system that truly stresses lexically-based align-
ment systems.
Each document pair has a correspondence be-
tween sentences, and we run GIZA++ on these
sentences to produce token-level alignments. We
take all aligned nouns as arguments and all aligned
verbs (excluding be-verbs, light verbs, and report-
ing verbs) as predicates. We then add negative ex-
amples by randomly substituting half of the sen-
tences in one document with sentences from an-

Performance vs Lexical Overlap

Figure 2: We plotted the PARMA?s performance on
each of the document pairs. Red squares show the
F1 for individual document pairs drawn from Roth
and Frank?s data set, and black circles show F1 for
our Multiple Translation Corpora test set. The x-
axis represents the cosine similarity between the
document pairs. On the RF data set, performance
is correlated with lexical similarity. On our more
lexically diverse set, this is not the case. This
could be due to the fact that some of the docu-
ments in the RF sets are minor re-writes of the
same newswire story, making them easy to align.
other corpus, guaranteed to be unrelated. The
amount of substitutions we perform can vary the
?relatedness? of the two documents in terms of
the predicates and arguments that they talk about.
This reflects our expectation of real world data,
where we do not expect perfect overlap in predi-
cates and arguments between a source and target
document, as you would in translation data.
Lastly, we prune any document pairs that have
more than 80 predicates or arguments or have a
Jaccard index on bags of lemmas greater than 0.5,
to give us a dataset of 328 document pairs.
Metric We use precision, recall, and F1. For the
RF dataset, we follow Roth and Frank (2012) and
Cohn et al (2008) and evaluate on a version of F1
that considers SURE and POSSIBLE links, which
are available in the RF data. Given an alignment
to be scored A and a reference alignment B which
contains SURE and POSSIBLE links, Bs andBp re-

for EECB and MTC reflect 5-fold cross validation,
and RF uses the given dev/test split.
Lemma baseline Following Roth and Frank we
include a lemma baseline, in which two predicates
or arguments align if they have the same lemma.9
4 Results
On every dataset PARMA significantly improves
over the lemma baselines (Table 1). On RF,
compared to Roth and Frank, the best published
method for this task, we also improve, making
PARMA the state of the art system for this task.
Furthermore, we expect that the smallest improve-
ments over Roth and Frank would be on RF, since
there is little training data. We also note that com-
pared to Roth and Frank we obtain much higher
recall but lower precision.
We also observe that MTC was more challeng-
ing than the other datasets, with a lower lemma
baseline. Figure 2 shows the correlation between
document similarity and document F1 score for
RF and MTC. While for RF these two measures
are correlated, they are uncorrelated for MTC. Ad-
ditionally, there is more data in the MTC dataset
which has low cosine similarity than in RF.
5 Conclusion
PARMA achieves state of the art performance on
three datasets for predicate argument alignment.
It builds on the development of lexical semantic
resources and provides a platform for learning to
utilize these resources. Additionally, we show that

tained 55.4; better than their system but worse than PARMA.
task difficulty can be strongly tied to lexical simi-
larity if the evaluation dataset is not chosen care-
fully, and this provides an artificially high baseline
in previous work. PARMA is robust to drops in lex-
ical similarity and shows large improvements in
those cases. PARMA will serve as a useful bench-
mark in determining the value of more sophis-
ticated models of predicate-argument alignment,
which we aim to address in future work.
While our system is fully supervised, and thus
dependent on manually annotated examples, we
observed here that this requirement may be rela-
tively modest, especially for in-domain data.
