Abstract
This paper describes LIMSI?s submis-
sions to the shared WMT?13 translation
task. We report results for French-English,
German-English and Spanish-English in
both directions. Our submissions use
n-code, an open source system based on
bilingual n-grams, and continuous space
models in a post-processing step. The
main novelties of this year?s participation
are the following: our first participation
to the Spanish-English task; experiments
with source pre-ordering; a tighter integra-
tion of continuous space language mod-
els using artificial text generation (for Ger-
man); and the use of different tuning sets
according to the original language of the
text to be translated.
1 Introduction
This paper describes LIMSI?s submissions to the
shared translation task of the Eighth Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation. LIMSI partici-
pated in the French-English, German-English and
Spanish-English tasks in both directions. For this
evaluation, we used n-code, an open source in-
house Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) sys-
tem based on bilingual n-grams1, and continuous
space models in a post-processing step, both for
translation and target language modeling.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
contains an overview of the baseline systems built
with n-code, including the continuous space mod-
els. As in our previous participations, several
steps of data pre-processing, cleaning and filter-
ing are applied, and their improvement took a non-
negligible part of our work. These steps are sum-
marized in Section 3. The rest of the paper is de-
voted to the novelties of the systems submitted this

year. Section 4 describes the system developed for
our first participation to the Spanish-English trans-
lation task in both directions. To translate from
German into English, the impact of source pre-
ordering is investigated, and experimental results
are reported in Section 5, while for the reverse di-
rection, we explored a text sampling strategy us-
ing a 10-gram SOUL model to allow a tighter in-
tegration of continuous space models during the
translation process (see Section 6). A final section
discusses the main lessons of this study.
2 System overview
n-code implements the bilingual n-gram approach
to SMT (Casacuberta and Vidal, 2004; Marin?o
et al, 2006; Crego and Marin?o, 2006). In this
framework, translation is divided in two steps: a
source reordering step and a (monotonic) transla-
tion step. Source reordering is based on a set of
learned rewrite rules that non-deterministically re-
order the input words. Applying these rules result
in a finite-state graph of possible source reorder-
ings, which is then searched for the best possible
candidate translation.
2.1 Features
Given a source sentence s of I words, the best
translation hypothesis t? is defined as the sequence
of J words that maximizes a linear combination of
feature functions:
t? = argmax
t,a
{ M?
m=1
?mhm(a, s, t)
}
(1)
where ?m is the weight associated with feature
function hm and a denotes an alignment between
source and target phrases. Among the feature
functions, the peculiar form of the translation
model constitutes one of the main difference be-
tween the n-gram approach and standard phrase-
based systems.
62
In addition to the translation model (TM), four-
teen feature functions are combined: a target-
language model; four lexicon models; six lexical-
ized reordering models (Tillmann, 2004; Crego et
al., 2011) aimed at predicting the orientation of
the next translation unit; a ?weak? distance-based
distortion model; and finally a word-bonus model
and a tuple-bonus model which compensate for the
system preference for short translations. The four
lexicon models are similar to the ones used in stan-
dard phrase-based systems: two scores correspond
to the relative frequencies of the tuples and two
lexical weights are estimated from the automatic
word alignments. The weight vector ? is learned
using the Minimum Error Rate Training frame-
work (MERT) (Och, 2003) and BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2002) measured on nt09 (newstest2009) as
the optimization criteria.
2.2 Translation Inference
During decoding, source sentences are represented
in the form of word lattices containing the most
promising reordering hypotheses, so as to repro-
duce the word order modifications introduced dur-
ing the tuple extraction process. Hence, only those
reordering hypotheses are translated and are intro-
duced using a set of reordering rules automatically
learned from the word alignments. Part-of-speech
(POS) information is used to increase the gen-
eralization power of these rules. Hence, rewrite
rules are built using POS, rather than surface word
forms (Crego and Marin?o, 2006).
2.3 SOUL rescoring
Neural networks, working on top of conventional
n-gram back-off language models (BOLMs), have
been introduced in (Bengio et al, 2003; Schwenk
et al, 2006) as a potential means to improve dis-
crete language models (LMs). As for our last year
participation (Le et al, 2012c), we take advantage
of the recent proposal of Le et al (2011). Using
a specific neural network architecture (the Struc-
tured OUtput Layer or SOUL model), it becomes
possible to estimate n-gram models that use large
vocabulary, thereby making the training of large
neural network LMs (NNLMs) feasible both for
target language models and translation models (Le
et al, 2012a). We use the same models as last year,
meaning that the SOUL rescoring was used for all
systems, except for translating into Spanish. See
section 6 and (Le et al, 2012c) for more details.
3 Corpora and data pre-processing
Concerning data pre-processing, we started from
our submissions from last year (Le et al, 2012c)
and mainly upgraded the corpora and the associ-
ated language-dependent pre-processing routines.
We used in-house text processing tools for the to-
kenization and detokenization steps (De?chelotte
et al, 2008). Previous experiments have demon-
strated that better normalization tools provide bet-
ter BLEU scores: all systems are thus built using
the ?true-case? scheme.
As German is morphologically more complex
than English, the default policy which consists in
treating each word form independently is plagued
with data sparsity, which severely impacts both
training (alignment) and decoding (due to un-
known forms). When translating from German
into English, the German side is thus normalized
using a specific pre-processing scheme (Allauzen
et al, 2010; Durgar El-Kahlout and Yvon, 2010)
which aims at reducing the lexical redundancy by
(i) normalizing the orthography, (ii) neutralizing
most inflections and (iii) splitting complex com-
pounds. All parallel corpora were POS-tagged
with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994); in addition,
for German, fine-grained POS labels were also
needed for pre-processing and were obtained us-
ing the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008).
For Spanish, all the availaible data are tokenized
using FreeLing2 toolkit (Padro? and Stanilovsky,
2012), with default settings and some added rules.
Sentence splitting and morphological analysis are
disabled except for del ? de el and al ? a el.
Moreover, a simple ?true-caser? based on upper-
case word frequency is used, and the specific
Spanish punctuation signs ??? and ??? are removed
and heuristically reintroduced in a post-processing
step. All Spanish texts are POS-tagged also using
Freeling. The EAGLES tag set is however sim-
plified by truncating the category label to the first
two symbols, in order to reduce the sparsity of the
reordering rules estimated by n-code.
For the CommonCrawl corpus, we found that
many sentences are not in the expected language.
For example, in the French side of the French-
English version, most of the first sentences are
in English. Therefore, foreign sentence pairs are
filtered out with a MaxEnt classifier that uses n-
grams of characters as features (n is between 1
and 4). This filter discards approximatively 10%
2http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/
63
of the sentence pairs. Moreover, we also observe
that a lot of sentence pairs are not translation of
each other. Therefore, an extra sentence alignment
step is carried out using an in-house implementa-
tion of the tool described in (Moore, 2002). This
last step discards approximately 20% of the cor-
pus. For the Spanish-English task, the same filter-
ing is applied to all the available corpora.
4 System development for the
Spanish-English task
This is our first participation to the Spanish-
English translation task in both directions. This
section provides details about the development of
n-code systems for this language pair.
4.1 Data selection and filtering
The CommonCrawl and UN corpora can be con-
sidered as very noisy and out-of-domain. As de-
scribed in (Allauzen et al, 2011), to select a subset
of parallel sentences, trigram LMs were trained for
both Spanish and English languages on a subset of
the available News data: the Spanish (resp. En-
glish) LM was used to rank the Spanish (resp. En-
glish) side of the corpus, and only those sentences
with perplexity above a given threshold were se-
lected. Finally, the two selected sets were in-
tersected. In the following experiments, the fil-
tered versions of these corpora are used to train
the translation systems unless explicitly stated.
4.2 Spanish language model
To train the language models, we assumed that the
test set would consist in a selection of recent news
texts and all the available monolingual data for
Spanish were used, including the Spanish Giga-
word, Third Edition. A vocabulary is first defined
by including all tokens observed in the News-
Commentary and Europarl corpora. This vocab-
ulary is then expanded with all words that occur
more than 10 times in the recent news texts (LDC-
2007-2011 and news-crawl-2011-2012). This pro-
cedure results in a vocabulary containing 372k
words. Then, the training data are divided into
7 sets based on dates or genres. On each set, a
standard 4-gram LM is estimated from the vocab-
ulary using absolute discounting interpolated with
lower order models (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen
and Goodman, 1998). The resulting LMs are then
linearly interpolated using coefficients chosen so

as to minimise the perplexity evaluated on the de-
velopment set (nt08).
4.3 Experiments
All reported results are averaged on 3 MERT runs.
Table 1 shows the BLEU scores obtained with dif-
ferent corpora setups. We can observe that us-
ing the CommonCrawl corpus improves the per-
formances in both directions, while the impact of
the UN data is less important, especially when
combined with CommonCrawl. The filtering strat-
egy described in Section 4.2 has a slightly posi-
tive impact of +0.1 BLEU point for the Spanish-
to-English direction but yields a 0.2 BLEU point
decrease in the opposite direction.
For the following experiments, all the available
corpora are therefore used: News-Commentary,
Europarl, filtered CommonCrawl and UN. For
each of these corpora, a bilingual n-gram model
is estimated and used by n-code as one individual
model score. An additionnal TM is trained on the
concatenation all these corpora, resulting in a to-
tal of 5 TMs. Moreover, n-code is able to handle
additional ?factored? bilingual models where the
source side words are replaced by the correspond-
ing lemma or even POS tag (Koehn and Hoang,
2007). Table 2 reports the scores obtained with
different settings.
In Table 2, big denotes the use of a wider
context for n-gram TMs (n = 4, 5, 4 instead
of 3, 4, 3 respectively for word-based, POS-based
and lemma-based TMs). Using POS factored

models yields a significant BLEU improvement,
as well as using a wider context for n-gram TMs.
Since Spanish is morphologically richer than En-
glish, lemmas are introduced only on the Span-
ish side. An additionnal BLEU improvement is
achieved by adding factored models based on lem-
mas when translating from Spanish to English,
while in the opposite direction it does not seem
to have any clear impact.
For English to Spanish, we also experimented
with a 5-gram target factored model, using the
whole morphosyntactic EAGLES tagset, (pos+ in
Table 2), to add some syntactic information, but
this, in fact, proved harmful.
As several tuning sets were available, experi-
ments were carried out with the concatenation of
nt09 to nt11 as a tuning data set. This yields an im-
provement between 0.1 and 0.3 BLEU point when
testing on nt12 when translating from Spanish to
English.
4.4 Submitted systems
For both directions, the submitted systems are
trained on all the available training data, the cor-
pora CommonCrawl and UN being filtered as de-
scribed previously. A word-based TM and a POS
factored TM are estimated for each training set.
To translate from Spanish to English, the system
is tuned on the concatenation of the nt09 to nt11
datasets with an additionnal 4-gram lemma-based
factored model, while in the opposite direction, we
only use nt11.

5 Source pre-ordering for English to
German translation
While distorsion models can efficiently handle
short range reorderings, they are inadequate to
capture long-range reorderings, especially for lan-
guage pairs that differ significantly in their syn-
tax. A promising workaround is the source pre-
ordering method that can be considered similar,
to some extent, to the reordering strategy imple-
mented in n-code; the main difference is that the
latter uses one deterministic (long-range) reorder-
ing on top of conventional distortion-based mod-
els, while the former only considers one single
model delivering permutation lattices. The pre-
ordering approach is illustrated by the recent work
of Neubig et al (2012), where the authors use a
discriminatively trained ITG parser to infer a sin-
gle permutation of the source sentence.
In this section, we investigate the use of this
pre-ordering model in conjunction with the bilin-
gual n-gram approach for translating English into
German (see (Collins et al, 2005) for similar ex-
periments with the reverse translation direction).
Experiments are carried out with the same settings
as described in (Neubig et al, 2012): given the
source side of the parallel data (en), the parser is
estimated to modify the original word order and to
generate a new source side (en-mod); then a SMT
system is built for the new language pair (en-mod
? de). The same reordering model is used to re-
order the test set, which is then translated with the
en-mod? de system.
Results for these experiments are reported in Ta-
ble 3, where nt09 and nt11 are respectively used
as development and test sets. We can observe that
applying pre-ordering on source sentences leads to
small drops in performance for this language pair.
To explain this degradation, the histogram of to-
ken movements performed by the model on the
pre-ordered training data is represented in Fig-
ure 1. We can observe that most of the movements
are in the range [?4,+6] (92% of the total occur-
65

rences), which can be already taken into account
by the standard reordering model of the baseline
system. This is reflected also by the following
statistics: surprisingly, only 16% of the total num-
ber of sentences are changed by the pre-ordering
model, and the average sentence-wise Kendall?s ?
and the average displacement of these small parts
of modified sentences are, respectively, 0.027 and
3.5. These numbers are striking for two reasons:
first, English and German have in general quite
different word order, thus our experimental con-
dition should be somehow similar to the English-
Japanese scenario studied in (Neubig et al, 2012);
second, since the model is able to perform pre-
ordering basically at any distance, it is surprising
that a large part of the data remains unmodified.
6 Artificial Text generation with SOUL
While the context size for BOLMs is limited (usu-
ally up to 4-grams) because of sparsity issues,
NNLMs can efficiently handle larger contexts up
to 10-grams without a prohibitive increase of the
overall number of parameters (see for instance the
study in (Le et al, 2012b)). However the major
bottleneck of NNLMs is the computation cost dur-
ing both training and inference. In fact, the pro-
hibitive inference time usually implies to resort to
a two-pass approach: the first pass uses a conven-
tional BOLM to produce a k-best list (the k most
likely translations); in the second pass, the prob-
ability of a NNLM is computed for each hypoth-
esis, which is then added as a new feature before
the k-best list is reranked. Note that to produce the
k-best list, the decoder uses a beam search strategy
to prune the search space. Crucially, this pruning
does not use the NNLMs scores and results in po-
tentially sub-optimal k-best-lists.
6.1 Sampling texts with SOUL
In language modeling, a language is represented
by a corpus that is approximated by a n-gram
model. Following (Sutskever et al, 2011; Deoras
et al, 2013), we propose an additionnal approxi-
mation to allow a tighter integration of the NNLM:
a 10-gram NNLM is first estimated on the training
corpus; texts then are sampled from this model to
create an artificial training corpus; finally, this arti-
ficial corpus is approximated by a 4-gram BOLM.
The training procedure for the SOUL NNLM is
the same as the one described in (Le et al, 2012c).
To sample a sentence from the SOUL model, first
the sentence length is randomly drawn from the
empirical distribution, then each word of the sen-
tence is sampled from the 10-gram distribution es-
timated with the SOUL model.
The convergence of this sampling strategy can
be evaluated by monitoring the perplexity evolu-
tion vs. the number of sentences that are gener-
ated. Figure 2 depicts this evolution by measuring
perplexity on the nt08 set with a step size of 400M
sampled sentences. The baseline BOLM (std) is
estimated on all the available training data that
consist of approximately 300M of running words.
We can observe that the perplexity of the BOLM
estimated on sampled texts (generated texts) de-
creases when the number of sample sentences in-
creases, and tends to reach slowly the perplex-
ity of the baseline BOLM. Moreover, when both
BOLMs are interpolated, an even lower perplex-
ity is obtained, which further decreases with the
amount of sampled training texts.
6.2 Translation results
Experiments are run for translation into German,
which lacks a GigaWord corpus. An artificial cor-
pus containing 3 billions of running words is first
generated as described in Section 6.1. This corpus
is used to estimate a BOLM with standard settings,
that is then used for decoding, thereby approxi-
mating the use of a NNLM during the first pass.
Results reported in Table 4 show that adding gen-
erated texts improves the BLEU scores even when
the SOUL model is added in a rescoring step. Also
note that using the LM trained on the sampled cor-
pus yields the same BLEU score that using the
standard LM.

cial texts and a third one that uses the freely avail-
able deWack corpus3 (1.7 billion words).

7 Different tunings for different original
languages
As shown by Lembersky et al (2012), the original
language of a text can have a significant impact on
translation performance. In this section, this effect
is assessed on the French to English translation
task. Training one SMT system per original lan-
guage is impractical, since the required informa-
tion is not available for most of parallel corpora.
However, metadata provided by the WMT evalua-
tion allows us to split the development and test sets
according to the original language of the text. To
ensure a sufficient amount of texts for each con-
dition, we used the concatenation of newstest cor-
pora for the years 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012,
leaving nt10 for testing purposes.
Five different development sets have been cre-
ated to tune five different systems. Experimental
results are reported in Table 7 and show a drastic

improvement in terms of BLEU score when trans-
lating back to the original English and a significant
increase for original text in Czech and French. In
this year?s evaluation, Russian was introduced as
a new language, so for sentences originally in this
language, the baseline system was used. This sys-
tem is used as our primary submission to the eval-
uation, with additional SOUL rescoring step.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we have described our submis-
sions to the translation task of WMT?13 for
the French-English, German-English and Spanish-
English language pairs. Similarly to last year?s
systems, our main submissions use n-code, and
continuous space models are introduced in a post-
processing step, both for translation and target lan-
guage modeling. To translate from English to
German, we showed a slight improvement with
a tighter integration of the continuous space lan-
guage model using a text sampling strategy. Ex-
periments with pre-ordering were disappointing,
and the reasons for this failure need to be better
understood. We also explored the impact of using
different tuning sets according to the original lan-
guage of the text to be translated. Even though the
gain vanishes when adding the SOUL model in a
post-processing step, it should be noted that due to
time limitation this second step was not tuned ac-
cordingly to the original language. We therefore
plan to assess the impact of using different tuning
sets on the post-processing step.
