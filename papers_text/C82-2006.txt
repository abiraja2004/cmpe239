Although there  has been work on machine t rans la t ion  
s ince  the ear ly  1950"s, i t  i s  on ly  in  the  las t  few years  
that  ~ systems have become capable of p~'oductng output  and-  
where near  the qua l i ty  needed fo r  wide-spread use.  The LinguAe- 
t i cs  Research Center  (LRC) at  the Un ivers i ty  of Texan at  Aus- 
t in  has developed a working machine t rans la t ion  system. METAL, 
the ac tua l  t rans la t ion  system, produces qua l i ty  E~l?sh  t rans -  
la t ions  fo r  German techn ica l  manuals.  Exper iments conducted 
with  up to 200 cont iguous pa~es of text  have been most en-  
cour t !  the LRC p lans  to .have a product ion  system by ear ly  
1983. 
METAL i s  a modular system in  which the lex icons ,  grammar, 
and ana lyzer  are d i s t inc t  packages, each of which may be modi f -  
ied  without a f fec t ing  the o ther  two. This paper w i l l  p resent  
an overview of METAL's l tnguAst tc  component, g iv ing  a geners~ 
overview of the scope and format of the METAL lex icons  and a 
somewhat more deta i led  descr ip t ion  of the METAL grammar. I% 
w i l l  then present  a descr ip t ion  of the t rans la t ion  process 
us ing  a s imple German sentence ,  and conclude w i th  a d i scuss ion  
of the cur rent  s ta te  of the l ingu is t i c  component, a long with  
comaents on what improvements are necessary  in  the ftucther 
development of the systemo

METAL Lexicons 
This sect ion  w i l l  b r ie f ly  descr ibe  the scope and format 
of the system lex icons .  METAL employs monol ingual  lex icons  fo r  
both the source and ts~get  languaKes,  and b i l ingua l  lex icons  
to equate each source language word' with a cor respond ing  ta r -  
get language equ iva lent .  The bi l in~pA~ or " t rans fer "  lex icons  
permit  a word in  the source language to be t rans la ted  in to  an~ 
of var ie ty  of words in  the ta rget  language depending on nuanc-  
es of gre~mat ica l  context .  The lex icons  e.re feature -based ,  
cons is t ing  of a ser ies  of syntact i c  and semant ic  features  and 
va lues  fo r  each lex ioa l  ent ry .  The paper w i l l  d i scuss  th i s  
feature -based  system in  genera l ,  l ook ing  at  the format of both  
the monol ingual  8J~d b i l~ugua l  ( " t rans fer " ) .  l ex icons .  This 
sect ion  w i l l  conclude with co- . .ents  on the codlnK procedures 
developed,  but not  yet fu l l y  implemented, fo r  use in  METAL 
lex icons .  
METAL Grammar 
This sect ion  w i l l  descr ibe  the format fo r  the gran~ar  
ru les  used in  the ana lys i s  of source language texts  and the 
synthes is  of cor respond ing  ta rget  language s t r ings .  METAL 
8~am~ur ru les  are augmented context - f ree  phrase s t ruc ture  
r t~es  wi th  a wide range of opt ions  al lowed in  the au~nentat ion  
partso 
The METAL approach to gre~r  i s  ra ther  d i f fe rent  from 
the "s tandard"  approach found in  many recent  a r t i c les .  In  the 
recent  work by l ingu is ts  such as Chomeky. Bresnsn,  and Gazd8~. 
the mean thrus t  has been to es tab l i sh  a theoret i ca l  framework 
which may then be app l ied  to human lan~s~e!  METAL?s'app~coach 
has been the oppos i te ,  i .e . ,  to seek so lu t ions  to re~ langua-  
ge problems and to use these so lu t ions  in  the development of 
a theoret i ca l  framework.

The grammatical  framework a l lows the l ingu is t  to  dev ise  
too ls  when they seem appropr ia te ,  and to  d i scard  them i f  they 
turn  out to be unnecessary .  In  th i s  sec t ion  par t i cu la r  emphas- 
i s  w i l l  be g iven  to  the var ious  au~nentat ion  par ts  of  the 
grammar u les ,  par t i cu la r ly  how these  par ts  are used to con-  
s t ra in  ru les ,  to  bu i ld  syntact i c  t rees ,  and to generate  the  
appropriate word order for the target language. This section 
will conclude with a discussion of METAL transformations and 
of the case frames mechanism, which is used to disambiguate 
strings. 
Sample Translation 
To illustrate the operation Of the linguistic component 
within METAL, the paper will then examine some significant 
steps involved in the analysis and synthesis of a German sen- 
tence. This examination will point up some of the typical 
problems in German - English machine translation, and the 
solutions used in METAL. Using representative lexical entries 
and grammar u les  tO demonstrate  theprocess ,  the paper w i l l  
i l l us t ra te  the product ion  of the cor rec t  Eng l i sh  t rans la t ion  
for the sample sentence. 
Conclusion 
~TAL  is capable of producing quality machine translat- 
ion of a large number of German sentence into English, but the 
system needs more development before a production version is 
available, In this section the paper will describe the limit- 
ations on and problems with the. METAL linguistic component in 
i t s  p resent  form, and w i l l  out l ine  the improvements cur rent ly  
planned to overcome these  l im i ta t ions  and problems. Par t i cu la r -  
l y  important  in  th i s  regard  i s  the need to  deve lop the semant-  
i cs  of  METAL from i t s  p resent  s ta te  in to  a fu l l  sca le  MT
