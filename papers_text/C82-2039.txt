1. Data bases, as par ts  of  procedures  
I t  i s  of  some advantage to compose procedures  fo r  auto -  
mat ic  langua6e process ing  of  two par ts :  
( i )  a log ica l  par t  ( r spresent~u~ the a lgQr i thm proper)  as 
the procedura l  component; 
( i i )  an in fo rmat ion  par t  ( conta in ing  the spec i f i c  i tems of  
in fo rmat ion  and depending on concrete  languages and 
purposes)  as the data  base.  
The log ica l  par t  determines  the s t ruc ture  o f  the i tems 
in  the in fo rmat ion  par t ,  p re ferences  between them and the i r  
cont r ibut ion  to the f ina l  resu l t .  The in fo rmat ion  par t  i s  
var iab le .  By des ign ing  the log ica l  par t  su f f i c ient ly  genera l ,  
one can use i t  even fo r  var ious  natura l  languages,  i f  one 
combln~s it with suitable information parts. The variability 
of  the in fo rmat ion  par t  admits easy cor rec t ions  and complet -  
ions  of  the whole procedure .  This i s  i l l us t ra ted  by some 
examples taken from wordfo~n ana lys i s .  
2. Modular s t ruc ture  of  log ica l  par ts .  
Another important  aspect  i s  the connect ion  between the 
s t ruc tures  of  the log ica l  par t  and the in fo rmat ion  par t  (data  
base) .  I f  the log ica l  par t  cons is ts  o f  some ( ra ther  independ-  
ent )  sub-procedures ,  the in fo rmat ion  par t  may be composed in  
a s imi la r  way: E i ther  a separate  in fo rmat ion  par t  fo r  every

of a simple version. 
3. Data bases as tools for establishing procedures 
In many cases the elaboration of procedures may be 
essentially facilitated by data bases: the base contains 
either a representative sample or the whole set of objects 
to be processed by the procedure together with the desired 
results. Combined with a certain (mostly rather simple) dial- 
ogue languages this type of data bases admits an automati~ 
look up of specific types and combinations, which is very 
advantageous for the elaboration, if a manual look up is im- 
possible (at least in a reasonable time). One special aspect 
is the compensation of lack of la~Euage competence. Further- 
more the same data base allows an automatic test of the f i~ l  
version of the procedure. This is illustrated by works on 
automatic hyphenation. 
4. Data bases as tools for linguistic research 
The data bases contain again linguistic objects together 
with additional informations (e.g. structural descriptions, 
classifications). Using a (more sophisticated) dialogue 
language one can put a lot of questions %o the data base and 
condense the results to frequencies, correlations,mutual 
exclusions and so on. This is illustrated by applications of 
data bases to research on syntax of na%~ral languages.
