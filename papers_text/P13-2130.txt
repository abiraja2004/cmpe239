Abstract
We present the first attempt to perform full
FrameNet annotation with crowdsourcing
techniques. We compare two approaches:
the first one is the standard annotation
methodology of lexical units and frame
elements in two steps, while the second
is a novel approach aimed at acquiring
frames in a bottom-up fashion, starting
from frame element annotation. We show
that our methodology, relying on a single
annotation step and on simplified role defi-
nitions, outperforms the standard one both
in terms of accuracy and time.
1 Introduction
Annotating frame information is a complex task,
usually modeled in two steps: first annotators are
asked to choose the situation (or frame) evoked by
a given predicate (the lexical unit, LU) in a sen-
tence, and then they assign the semantic roles (or
frame elements, FEs) that describe the participants
typically involved in the chosen frame. Existing
frame annotation tools, such as Salto (Burchardt
et al, 2006) and the Berkeley system (Fillmore et
al., 2002) foresee this two-step approach, in which
annotators first select a frame from a large reposi-
tory of possible frames (1,162 frames are currently
listed in the online version of the resource), and
then assign the FE labels constrained by the cho-
sen frame to LU dependents.
In this paper, we argue that such workflow
shows some redundancy which can be addressed
by radically changing the annotation methodology
and performing it in one single step. Our novel an-
notation approach is also more compliant with the
definition of frames proposed in Fillmore (1976):
in his seminal work, Fillmore postulated that the
meanings of words can be understood on the basis
of a semantic frame, i.e. a description of a type
of event or entity and the participants in it. This
implies that frames can be distinguished one from
another on the basis of the participants involved,
thus it seems more cognitively plausible to start
from the FE annotation to identify the frame ex-
pressed in a sentence, and not the contrary.
The goal of our methodology is to provide full
frame annotation in a single step and in a bottom-
up fashion. Instead of choosing the frame first, we
focus on FEs and let the frame emerge based on
the chosen FEs. We believe this approach com-
plies better with the cognitive activity performed
by annotators, while the 2-step methodology is
more artificial and introduces some redundancy
because part of the annotators? choices are repli-
cated in the two steps (i.e. in order to assign a
frame, annotators implicitly identify the partici-
pants also in the first step, even if they are anno-
tated later).
Another issue we investigate in this work is how
semantic roles should be annotated in a crowd-
sourcing framework. This task is particularly
complex, therefore it is usually performed by ex-
pert annotators under the supervision of linguis-
tic experts and lexicographers, as in the case of
FrameNet. In NLP, different annotation efforts
for encoding semantic roles have been carried out,
each applying its own methodology and annota-
tion guidelines (see for instance Ruppenhofer et
al. (2006) for FrameNet and Palmer et al (2005)
for PropBank). In this work, we present a pilot
study in which we assess to what extent role de-
scriptions meant for ?linguistics experts? are also
suitable for annotators from the crowd. Moreover,
we show how a simplified version of these descrip-
tions, less bounded to a specific linguistic theory,
improve the annotation quality.
2 Related work
The construction of annotation datasets for NLP
tasks via non-expert contributors has been ap-
742
proached in different ways, the most prominent
being games with a purpose (GWAP) and micro-
tasks. Verbosity (Von Ahn et al, 2006) was one
of the first attempts in gathering annotations with
a GWAP. Phrase Detectives (Chamberlain et al,
2008; Chamberlain et al, 2009) was meant to
gather a corpus with coreference resolution an-
notations. Snow et al (2008) described design
and evaluation guidelines for five natural language
micro-tasks. However, they explicitly chose a set
of tasks that could be easily understood by non-
expert contributors, thus leaving the recruitment
and training issues open. Negri et al (2011) built
a multilingual textual entailment dataset for statis-
tical machine translation systems.
The semantic role labeling problem has been re-
cently addressed via crowdsourcing by Hong and
Baker (2011). Furthermore, Baker (2012) high-
lighted the crucial role of recruiting people from
the crowd in order to bypass the need for linguis-
tics expert annotations. Nevertheless, Hong and
Baker (2011) focused on the frame discrimination
task, namely selecting the correct frame evoked by
a given lemma. Such task is comparable to the
word sense disambiguation one as per (Snow et
al., 2008), although the complexity increased, due
to lower inter-annotator agreement values.
3 Experiments
In this section, we describe the anatomy and dis-
cuss the results of the tasks we outsourced to the
crowd via the CrowdFlower1 platform.
Golden data Quality control of the collected
judgements is a key factor for the success of
the experiments. Cheating risk is minimized by
adding gold units, namely data for which the re-
quester already knows the answer. If a worker
misses too many gold answers within a given
threshold, he or she will be flagged as untrusted
and his or her judgments will be automatically dis-
carded.
Worker switching effect Depending on their
accuracy in providing answers to gold units, work-
ers may switch from a trusted to an untrusted sta-
tus and vice versa. In practice, a worker submits
his or her responses via a web page. Each page
contains one gold unit and a variable number of
regular units that can be set by the requester dur-
ing the calibration phase. If a worker becomes un-
1https://crowdflower.com
trusted, the platform collects another judgment to
fill the gap. If a worker moves back to the trusted
status, his or her previous contribution is added
to the results as free extra judgments. Such phe-
nomenon typically occurs when the complexity of
gold units is high enough to induce low agree-
ment in workers? answers. Thus, the requester is
constrained to review gold units and to eventually
forgive workers who missed them. This has mas-
sively happened in our experiments and is one of
the main causes of the overall cost decrease and
time increase.
Cost calibration The total cost of a generic
crowdsourcing task is naturally bound to a data
unit. This represents an issue in most of our ex-
periments, as the number of questions per unit
(i.e. a sentence) varies according to the number
of frames and FEs evoked by the LU contained in
a sentence. In order to enable cost comparison, for
each experiment we need to use the average num-
ber of questions per sentence as a multiplier to a
constant cost per sentence. We set the payment
per working page to 5 $ cents and the number of
sentences per page to 3, resulting in 1.83 $ cent
per sentence.
3.1 Assessing task reproducibility and
worker behavior change
Since our overall goal is to compare the perfor-
mance of FrameNet annotation using our novel
workflow to the performance of the standard, 2-
step approach, we first take into account past re-
lated works and try to reproduce them.
To our knowledge, the only attempt to annotate
frame information through crowdsourcing is the
one presented in Hong and Baker (2011), which
however did not include FE annotation.
Modeling The task is designed as follows. (a)
Workers are invited to read a sentence where a
LU is bolded. (b) The question Which is the
correct sense? is combined with the set of
frames evoked by the given LU, as well as the
None choice. Finally, (c) workers must select the
correct frame. A set of example sentences corre-
sponding to each possible frame is provided in the
instructions to facilitate workers.
As a preliminary study, we wanted to assess
to what extent the proposed task could be repro-
duced and if workers reacted in a comparable way
over time. Hong and Baker (2011) did not pub-
lish the input datasets, thus we ignore which sen-
743

rip.v 88 (12) 81.9 92
thirst.n 29 (4) 90.4 95
top.a 36 (5) 98.7 96
Table 1: Comparison of the reproduced frame dis-
crimination task as per (Hong and Baker, 2011)
tences were used. Besides, the authors computed
accuracy values directly from the results upon a
majority vote ground truth. Therefore, we de-
cided to consider the same LUs used in Hong
and Baker?s experiments, i.e. high.a, history.n,
range.n, rip.v, thirst.n and top.a, but we lever-
aged the complete sets of FrameNet 1.5 expert-
annotated sentences as gold-standard data for im-
mediate accuracy computation.
Discussion Table 1 displays the results we
achieved, jointly with the experiments by Hong
and Baker (2011). For the latter, we only show ac-
curacy values, as the number of sentences was set
to a constant value of 18, 2 of which were gold.
If we assume that the crowd-based ground truth in
2011 experiments is approximately equivalent to
the expert one, workers seem to have reacted in
a similar manner compared to Hong and Baker?s
values, except for rip.v.
3.2 General task setting
We randomly chose the following LUs among
the set of all verbal LUs in FrameNet evoking 2
frames each: disappear.v [CEASING TO BE, DE-
PARTING], guide.v [COTHEME, INFLUENCE OF -
EVENT ON COGNIZER], heap.v [FILLING, PLAC-
ING], throw.v [BODY MOVEMENT, CAUSE MO-
TION]. We considered verbal LUs as they usually
have more overt arguments in a sentence, so that
we were sure to provide workers with enough can-
didate FEs to annotate. Linguistic tasks in crowd-
sourcing frameworks are usually decomposed to
make them accessible to the crowd. Hence, we
set the polysemy of LUs to 2 to ensure that all
experiments are executed using the smallest-scale
subtask. More frames can then be handled by just
replicating the experiments.
3.3 2-step approach
After observing that we were able to achieve sim-
ilar results on the frame discrimination task as in
previous work, we focused on the comparison be-
tween the 2-step and the 1-step frame annotation
approaches.
We first set up experiments that emulate the for-
mer approach both in frame discrimination and
FEs annotation. This will serve as the baseline
against our methodology. Given the pipeline na-
ture of the approach, errors in the frame discrim-
ination step will affect FE recognition, thus im-
pacting on the final accuracy. The magnitude of
such effect strictly depends on the number of FEs
associated with the wrongly detected frame.
3.3.1 Frame discrimination
Frame discrimination is the first phase of the 2-
step annotation procedure. Hence, we need to
leverage its output as the input for the next step.
Modeling The task is modeled as per Sec-
tion 3.1.
Discussion Table 2 gives an insight into the re-
sults, which confirm the overall good accuracy as
per the experiments discussed in Section 3.1.
3.3.2 Frame elements recognition
We consider all sentences annotated in the previ-
ous subtask with the frame assigned by the work-
ers, even if it is not correct.
Modeling The task is presented as follows. (a)
Workers are invited to read a sentence where a LU
is bolded and the frame that was identified in the
first step is provided as a title. (b) A list of FE def-
initions is then shown together with the FEs text
chunks. Finally, (c) workers must match each def-
inition with the proper FE.
Simplification Since FEs annotation is a very
challenging task, and FE definitions are usually
meant for experts in linguistics, we experimented
with three different types of FE definitions: the
original ones from FrameNet, a manually simpli-
fied version, and an automatically simplified one,
using the tool by Heilman and Smith (2010). The
latter simplifies complex sentences at the syntactic
level and generates a question for each of the ex-
tracted clauses. As an example, we report below
three versions obtained for the Agent definition in
the DAMAGING frame:

Table 2: Overview of the experimental results.

Recognition
Original: The conscious entity, generally a per-
son, that performs the intentional action that re-
sults in the damage to the Patient.
Manually simplified: This element describes the
person that performs the intentional action result-
ing in the damage to another person or object.
Automatic system: What that performs the in-
tentional action that results in the damage to the
Patient?
Simplification was performed by a linguistic ex-
pert, and followed a set of straightforward guide-
lines, which can be summarized as follows:
? When the semantic type associated with the
FE is a common concept (e.g. Location),
replace the FE name with the semantic type.
? Make syntactically complex definitions as
simple as possible.
? Avoid variability in FE definitions, try to
make them homogeneous (e.g. they should
all start with ?This element describes...? or
similar).
? Replace technical concepts such as
Artifact or Sentient with com-
mon words such as Object and Person
respectively.
Although these changes (especially the last
item) may make FE definitions less precise from
a lexicographic point of view (for instance, sen-
tient entities are not necessarily persons), annota-
tion became more intuitive and had a positive im-
pact on the overall quality.
After few pilot annotations with the three types
of FE definitions, we noticed that the simplified
one achieved a better accuracy and a lower num-
ber of untrusted annotators compared to the oth-
ers. Therefore, we use the simplified definitions
in both the 2-step and the 1-step approach (Sec-
tion 3.4).
Discussion Table 2 provides an overview of the
results we gathered. The total number of answers
differs from the total number of trusted judgments,
since the average value of questions per sentence
amounts to 1.5.2 First of all, we notice an increase
in the number of untrusted judgments. This is
caused by a generally low inter-worker agreement
on gold sentences due to FE definitions, which still
present a certain degree of complexity, even af-
ter simplification. We inspected the full reports
sentence by sentence and observed a propagation
of incorrect judgments when a sentence involves
an unclear FE definition. As FE definitions may
mutually include mentions of other FEs from the
same frame, we believe this circularity generated
confusion.
3.4 1-step approach
Having set the LU polysemy to 2, in our case a
sentence S always contains a LU with 2 possible
frames (f1, f2), but only conveys one, e.g. f1. We
formulate the approach as follows. S is replicated
in 2 data units (Sa, Sb). Then, Sa is associated to
the set E1 of f1 FE definitions, namely the correct
ones for that sentence. Instead, Sb is associated to
the set E2 of f2 FE definitions. We call Sb a cross-
frame unit. Furthermore, we allow workers to se-
lect the None answer. In practice, we ask a total
amount of |E1 ? E2| + 2 questions per sentence
S. In this way, we let the frame directly emerge
from the FEs. If workers correctly answer None
to a FE definition d ? E2, the probability that S
evokes f1 increases.
Modeling Figure 1 displays a screenshot of
the worker interface. The task is designed as per
Section 3.3.2, but with major differences with
respect to its content. This is better described
by an example. The sentence Karen threw
her arms round my neck, spilling
champagne everywhere contains the LU
throw.v evoking the frame BODY MOVEMENT.
However, throw.v is ambiguous and may also
evoke CAUSE MOTION. We ask to annotate both
the BODY MOVEMENT and the CAUSE MOTION

Discussion We do not interpret the None choice
as an abstention from judgment, since it is a cor-
rect answer for cross-frame units. Instead of pre-
cision and recall, we are thus able to directly com-
pute workers? accuracy upon a majority vote. We
envision an improvement with respect to the 2-
step methodology, as we avoid the proven risk of
error propagation originating from wrongly anno-
tated frames in the first step. Table 2 illustrates
the results we collected. As expected, accuracy
reached a consistent enhancement. This demon-
strates the hypothesis we stated in Section 1 on
the cognitive plausibility of a bottom-up approach
for frame annotation. Furthermore, the execu-
tion time decreases compared to the sum of the
2 steps, namely 130 hours against 171. Neverthe-
less, the cost is sensibly higher due to the higher
number of questions that need to be addressed, in
average 4.6 against 1.5. Untrusted judgments se-
riously grow, mainly because of the cross-frame
gold complexity. Workers seem puzzled by the
presence of None, which is a required answer for
such units. If we consider the English FrameNet
annotation agreement values between experts re-
ported by Pado? and Lapata (2009) as the upper
bound (i.e., .897 for frame discrimination and .949
for FEs recognition), we believe our experimental
setting can be reused as a valid alternative.
4 Conclusion
In this work, we presented an approach to perform
frame annotation with crowdsourcing techniques,
based on a single annotation step and on manu-
ally simplified FE definitions. Since the results
seem promising, we are currently running larger
scale experiments with the full set of FrameNet 1.5
annotated sentences. Input data, interface screen-
shots and full results are available and regularly
updated at http://db.tt/gu2Mj98i.
Future work will include the investigation of a
frame assignment strategy. In fact, we do not take
into account the case of conflicting FE annotations
in cross-frame units. Hence, we need a confidence
score to determine which frame emerges if work-
ers selected contradictory answers in a subset of
cross-frame FE definitions.
