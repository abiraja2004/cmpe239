Abstract
In this work we propose a transla-
tion model for monolingual sentence
retrieval. We propose four methods
for constructing a parallel corpus. Of
the four methods proposed, a lexi-
con learned from a bilingual Arabic-
English corpus aligned at the sentence
level performs best, significantly im-
proving results over the query likeli-
hood baseline. Further, we demon-
strate that smoothing from the local
context of the sentence improves re-
trieval over the query likelihood base-
line.
1 Introduction
Sentence retrieval is the task of retrieving a rel-
evant sentence in response to a user?s query.
Tasks such as question answering, novelty de-
tection and summarization often incorporate a
sentence retrieval module. In previous work we
examined sentence retrieval for question answer-
ing (Murdock and Croft, 2004). This involves
the comparison of two well-formed sentences,
one a question, one a statement. In this work we
compare well-formed sentences to queries, which
can be typical keyword queries of 1 to 3 terms,
or a set of sentences or sentence fragments. The
TREC Novelty Track provides this type of data
in the form of topic titles and descriptions, and
sentence-level relevance judgments for a small
subset of the collection.
We present a translation model specifically
for monolingual data, and show that it signif-
icantly improves sentence retrieval over query-
likelihood. Translation models train on a paral-
lel corpus and in previous work we used a cor-
pus of question/answer pairs. No such corpus
is available for the novelty data, so in this pa-
per we present four ways to construct a parallel
corpus, to estimate a translation model.
Many systems treat sentence retrieval as a
type of document or passage retrieval. In our
data a sentence is an average of 18 words, most
of which occur once. A document is an average
of 700 words, many of which are multiples of
the same term. It is much less likely for a word
and its synonym terms to appear in the same
sentence than in the same document.
Passages may be any length, either fixed or
variable, but are somewhat arbitrarily desig-
nated. Many systems that have a passage re-
trieval module, on closer inspection have de-
fined the passage to be a sentence. What is
needed is a sentence retrieval mechanism that
retains the benefits of passage retrieval, where
a passage is longer than a sentence. We pro-
pose that smoothing from the local context of
the sentence improves retrieval over the query
likelihood baseline, and the larger the context,
the greater the improvement.
We describe our translation model in sec-
tion 2, along with our smoothing approach. In
section 3 we discuss previous work in sentence
retrieval for the Novelty task, and translation
models for information retrieval tasks. Sec-
tion 4 presents four ways to estimate a trans-
lation model, in the absence of a parallel cor-
pus, and presents our experimental results. We

discuss the results in section 5, and present our
conclusions and future work in section 6.
2 Methodology
Our data was provided by NIST, as part of
the TREC Novelty Track1. The documents for
the TREC Novelty Track in 2002 were taken
from the TREC volumes 4 and 5, and consist
of news articles from the Financial Times, the
Foreign Broadcast Information Service, and the
Los Angeles Times from non-overlapping years.
In 2003 and 2004, the documents were taken
from the Aquaint Corpus, which is distributed
by the Linguistic Data Consortium2 and con-
sists of newswire text in English from the Xin-
hua News Service, the New York Times, and the
Associated Press from overlapping years.
We retrieved the top 1000 documents for
each topic from the TREC and Aquaint col-
lections, and sentence segmented the docu-
ments using MXTerminator (Reynar and Rat-
naparkhi, 1997), which is a freely available sen-
tence boundary detector. Each topic was in-
dexed separately and had an average of 30,000
sentences. It was impractical to do sentence-
level relevance assessments for the complete set
of 150,000 documents, so we used the relevance
assessments provided as part of the Novelty
task, recognizing that the results are a lower
bound on performance, because the relevance
assessments do not cover the collection. The
relevance assessments cover 25 known relevant
documents for each topic.
We evaluated precision at N documents be-
cause many systems using sentence retrieval em-
phasize the results at the top of the ranked list,
and are less concerned with the overall quality
of the list.
2.1 Translation Models
We incorporated a machine translation model
in two steps: estimation and ranking. In the
estimation step, the probability that a term in
the sentence ?translates? to a term in the query
is estimated using the implementation of IBM
1http://trec.nist.gov
2http://www.ldc.upenn.edu
Model 1 (Brown et al, 1990) in GIZA++ (Al-
Onaizan et al, 1999) out-of-the-box without
alteration. In the ranking step we incorpo-
rate the translation probabilities into the query-
likelihood framework.
In Berger and Lafferty (1999), the IBM Model
1 is incorporated thus:
P (qi|S) =
m
?
j=1
P (qi|sj)P (sj |S) (1)
where P (qi|sj) is the probability that term sj in
the sentence translates to term qi in the query.
If the translation probabilities are modified such
that P (qi|sj) = 1 if qi = sj and 0 otherwise,
this is Berger and Lafferty?s ?Model 0?, and it
is exactly the query-likelihood model (described
in section 2.2).
A major difference between machine transla-
tion and sentence retrieval is that machine trans-
lation assumes there is little, if any, overlap in
the vocabularies of the two languages. In sen-
tence retrieval we depend heavily on the overlap
between the two vocabularies. With the Berger
and Lafferty formulation in equation 1, the prob-
ability of a word translating to itself is estimated
as a fraction of the probability of the word trans-
lating to all other words. Because the probabil-
ities must sum to one, if there are any other
translations for a given word, its self-translation
probability will be less than 1.0. To accommo-
date this monolingual condition, we make the
following improvement.
Let ti = 1 if there exists a term in the sentence
sj such that qi = sj , and 0 otherwise:
?
1?j?n
p(qi|sj)p(sj |S) =?
tip(qi|S) + (1 ? ti)
?
1?j?n,sj 6=qi
p(qi|sj)p(sj |S)
(2)
The translation probabilities still sum to one.
We determined empirically that this adjustment
improved the results over IBM model 1, and over
Berger and Lafferty model 0.

2.2 Document Smoothing
Query likelihood is a generative model that as-
sumes that the sentence is a sample of a multino-
mial distribution of terms. Sentences are ranked
according to the probability they generate the
query. We estimate this probability by interpo-
lating the term distribution in the sentence with
the term distribution in the collection:
P (Q|S) = P (S)
|Q|
?
i=1
(
?P (qi|S) + (1 ? ?)P (qi|C)
)
(3)
where Q is the query, S is the sentence, P (S) is
the (uniform) prior probability of the sentence,
P (qi|S) is the probability that term qi in the
query appears in the sentence, and P (qi|C) is
the probability that qi appears in the collection.
In the experiments with document smoothing,
we estimate the probability of a sentence gener-
ating the query:
P (Q|S) =
P (S)
|Q|
?
i=1
(
?P (qi|S) + ?P (qi|DS) + ?P (qi|C)
)
(4)
where ?+? +? = 1.0 and P (qi|DS) is the prob-
ability that the term qi in the query appears
in the document the sentence came from. In
our case, since the sentences for each topic are
indexed separately, the collection statistics are
in reference to the documents in the individual
topic index.
3 Previous Work
The TREC Novelty Track ran for three years,
from 2002 to 2004. Overviews of the track
can be found in (Harman, 2002), (Soboroff and
Harman, 2003) and (Soboroff, 2004). A num-
ber of systems use traditional information re-
trieval techniques for sentence retrieval, using
various techniques to compensate for the sparse
term distributions in sentences. The Univer-
sity of Massachusetts (Larkey et al, 2002) and
Carnegie Mellon University (Collins-Thompson
et al, 2002) both ranked sentences by the co-
sine similarity of the sentence vector to the
query vector of tf.idf-weighted terms. Amster-
dam University (Monz et al, 2002) used tfc.nfx
term weighting which is a variant of tf.idf term
weighting that normalizes the lengths of the doc-
ument vectors. Meiji University (Ohgaya et al,
2003) expanded the query with concept groups,
and then ranked the sentences by the cosine sim-
ilarity between the expanded topic vector and
the sentence vector.
Berger and Lafferty (1999) proposed the use of
translation models for (mono-lingual) document
retrieval. They used IBM Model 1 (Brown et
al., 1990), to rank documents according to their
translation probability, given the query. They
make no adjustment for the fact that the query
and the document are in the same language, and
instead rely on the translation model to learn
the appropriate weights for word pairs. The
models are trained on parallel data artificially
constructed from the mutual information distri-
bution of terms in the document. The results
presented either were not tested for statistical
significance, or they were not statistically signif-
icant, because no significance results were given.
Berger et al (2000) used IBM Model 1 to rank
answers to questions in call-center data. In their
data, there were no answers that were not in
response to at least one of the questions, and all
questions had at least one answer. Furthermore,
there are multiples of the same question. The
task is to match questions and answers, given
that every question has at least one match in the
data. The translation models performed better
for this task than the tf.idf baseline.
4 Experiments and Results
In this section we describe four methods for es-
timating a translation model in the absence of
a parallel corpus. We describe experimental re-
sults for each of the translation models, as well
as for document smoothing.
4.1 Mutual Information and TREC
As in Berger and Lafferty (1999), a set of
documents was selected at random from the
TREC collection, and for each document we

constructed a distribution according to each
term?s mutual information with the document,
and randomly generated five queries of 8 words
according to this distribution. We were retriev-
ing sentences rather than documents, so each
sentence in the document was ranked according
to its probability of having generated the query,
and then the query was aligned with the top 5
sentences. We call this approach ?MI?.
The second approach uses the TREC topic
titles and descriptions aligned with the top 5
retrieved sentences from documents known to
be relevant to those topics, excluding topics that
were included in the Novelty data. We call this
approach ?TREC?.
Table 1 shows the results of incorporating
translations for topic descriptions. Results in
the tables with an asterisk are significant at the
.05 level using a two-tailed t-test. The results
for sentence retrieval are lower than those typ-
ically obtained for document retrieval. Manual
inspection of the results indicates that the ac-
tual precision is much higher, and resembles the
results for document retrieval. The lower results
are an artifact of the way the relevance assess-
ments were obtained. The sentence-level judge-
ments from the TREC Novelty Track are only
for 25 documents per topic.
The Novelty data from 2003-2004 consists of
event and opinion queries. We observed that

a number of the topic descriptions for event
topics had a high degree of vocabulary overlap
with the sentences in our data. This was not
true of the opinion queries. The results of us-
ing a translation-based retrieval on description
queries are given in table 2, broken down by
the sentiment of the query. The Novelty queries
from 2002 were included in the ?event? set.
Not all of the sentences judged relevant to
opinion topics express opinions. To assess
opinion-relevance we evaluated the top 10 sen-
tences, and marked sentences that expressed
opinions. In our data approximately 10% of
sentences in the top 10 express opinions. Ta-
ble 3 shows the result of using a translation
model trained on TREC data for description
queries, broken down by sentiment, with the
baselines evaluated for this particular set of rel-
evance judgments. For opinion questions, the
column labeled ?topical? indicates topical rele-
vance. The column labeled ?opinion? indicates
topical relevance that also expresses an opinion.
If we consider a sentence relevant to an opin-
ion question only if it expresses an opinion, we
see improvement in the results at the top of the
ranked list for those queries, using a transla-
tion model trained on TREC data. Of the 150
topics, only 50 were opinion topics, so although
the magnitude of the improvement in opinion
queries is large the results are not statistically

significant with respect to the baseline.
4.2 Lexicons
External lexicons are often useful for transla-
tion and query expansion. The most obvious
approach was to incorporate a thesaurus into
the training process in GIZA as a dictionary,
which affects the statistics in the first iteration
of EM. This is intended to improve the qual-
ity of the alignments over subsequent iterations.
We incorporated the thesauri into the training
process of the data generated from the artificial
mutual information distribution. The dictionar-
ies had almost no effect on the results.
4.2.1 WordNet
We created a parallel corpus of synonym-term
pairs from WordNet, and added this data to the
artificial mutual information data to train the
translation model. The results of using this ap-
proach to retrieve sentences using title queries
are in figure 1, labeled ?MI WN?. Using Word-
Net alne, without the mutual information data,
is labeled ?WN Only?. The results are statisti-
cally significant using a Wilcoxon sign test at the
.05 level for precision at .10, .20 and .60. Query
likelihood retrieval is the baseline. The results
for description queries are not shown, and were
not significantly different from the baseline.

4.2.2 Arabic-English corpus
Xu et al (2002) derive an Arabic thesaurus
from a parallel corpus. We derived an En-
glish thesaurus using the same approach, from a
pair of English-Arabic/Arabic-English lexicons,
learned from a parallel corpus. We assumed that
if two English terms translate to the same Ara-
bic term, the English terms are synonyms whose
probability is given by
P (e2|e1) =
?

P (e2|a)P (a|e1) (5)
Figure 2 shows the interpolated recall-
precision of these results, for description queries.
The English terms were not stemmed, and so
the baseline query-likelihood results are also not
stemmed. The results are statistically signifi-
cant using a Wilcoxon sign test at the .05 level,
for all retrieval levels. Not shown is the average
precision, which is also significantly better for
the Arabic-English lexicon than for the query-
likelihood. The results for title queries are not
shown, but are similar to those for descriptions.

4.3 Document Smoothing
Smucker and Allan (2005) demonstrated
that under certain conditions, Jelinek-Mercer
smoothing is equivalent to Dirichlet smoothing,
and that the advantage of Dirichlet smoothing
is derived from the fact that it smoothes long
documents less than shorter documents. In our
data there is much less variance in the length
of a sentence than in the length of a document,
thus we do not expect to see as great a benefit
in performance from Dirichlet smoothing as has
been reported in Zhai and Lafferty (2001). In
fact we tried Absolute Discounting, Dirichlet,
Jelinek-Mercer and Laplace smoothing and
found them to produce equivalent results.
The vast majority of sentences in our data
are not stand-alone units, and the topic of the
sentence is also the topic of surrounding sen-
tences. We took a context of the surround-
ing 5 sentences, and the surrounding 11 sen-
tences (about 1/3 of the whole document). The
sentences were smoothed from the surrounding
context, backing-off to the whole document, us-

ing Jelinek-Mercer smoothing. Table 4 shows a
comparison of the amount of context. Smooth-
ing from the local context is clearly better than
the baseline result.
We investigated the effect of smoothing from
the entire document. Table 5 shows the results.
Both topic titles and descriptions get signifi-
cantly better results with document smoothing.
4.4 Novelty Relevance Task
In the TREC Novelty Track, participants are
given a set of 25 documents most of which are
relevant for each topic. If we believe that a doc-
ument is relevant because it has relevant sen-
tences in it, then a ?good? sentence would come
from a ?good? document. This would suggest
that smoothing from the document the sentence
came from would improve retrieval. We found
that for title queries document smoothing im-
proved precision in the top 5 documents by
12.5%, which is statistically significant using a
two-tailed t-test at the .05 level. Precision in
the top 10 - 100 documents also improved re-
sults by an average of 5%, but the result is not
statistically significant. For description queries,
smoothing from the document had no effect.
For title queries, translation models improve
the average precision, and R-Precision. For both
title and description queries, the number of rel-
evant documents that are retrieved is also im-
proved with translation models.

5 Discussion
The results for sentence retrieval are low, in
comparison to results we would expect for doc-
ument retrieval. We might think that although
we show improvements, nothing is working well.
In reality, the relevance assessments provided by
NIST as part of the Novelty Track only cover
25 documents per topic. Evaluating the top 10
sentences by hand shows that the systems give a
performance comparable to document retrieval
systems, and the low numbers are the result of
a lack of coverage in the assessments. Unfor-
tunately, there is no collection of documents of
significant size, where the relevance assessments
at the sentence level cover the collection. Con-
structing such a corpus would be a major un-
dertaking, outside of the scope of this paper.
The best performing method of constructing
a parallel corpus used a bilingual lexicon derived
from a sentence-aligned Arabic-English parallel
corpus. This suggests that data in which sen-
tences are actually translations of one another,
as opposed to sentences aligned with key terms
from the document, yield a higher quality lexi-
con. The model trained on the parallel corpus of
TREC topics and relevant sentences performed
better than the MI corpus, but not as well as the
Arabic-English corpus. The TREC corpus con-
sisted of approximately 15,000 sentence pairs,
whereas the Arabic-English corpus was trained
on more than a million sentence pairs. This may
account in part for the higher quality results. In
addition, the TREC corpus was created by re-
trieving the top 5 sentences from each relevant
document. Even when the document is known
to be relevant, the retrieval process is noisy. Fur-
thermore, although there were 15,000 sentence
pairs, there were only 450 unique queries, limit-
ing the size of the source vocabulary.
Opinion topics have much less vocabulary
overlap with relevant sentences than do event
topics. Translation models would be expected
to perform better when retrieving sentences that
contain synonym or related terms. For sentences
that have exact matches in the query, query like-
lihood will perform better.
We find that smoothing from the local con-
text of the sentence performs significantly bet-
ter than the baseline retrieval. The sentences are
all about the same length, so there is no perfor-
mance advantage to using Dirichlet smoothing,
whose smoothing parameter is a function of the
document length. The smoothing parameters
gave very little weight to the collection. As sen-
tences have few terms, relative to documents,
matching a term in the query is a good indica-
tion of relevance.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We have shown that translation models improve
retrieval for title and opinion queries, and that
a translation model derived from a high-quality
bilingual lexicon significantly improves retrieval
for title and description queries. Smoothing
from the local context of a sentence dramati-
cally improves retrieval, with smoothing from
the document that contains the sentence per-
forming the best.
We evaluated sentences based on lexical sim-
ilarity, but structural similarity is also an im-
portant measure, which we plan to investigate
in the future. The translation model we used
was the most basic model. We used this model
because it had been shown effective in docu-
ment retrieval, and was easily incorporated in
the query-likelihood framework, but we intend
690
to explore more sophisticated translation mod-
els, and better alignment mechanisms. Prelimi-
nary results suggest that sentence retrieval can
be used to improve document retrieval, but we
plan a more extensive investigation of evaluat-
ing document similarity and relevance based on
sentence-level similarity.
