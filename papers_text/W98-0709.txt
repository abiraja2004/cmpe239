Abstract  
This paper summarises a set of 
methodologies and techniques for the fast 
construction of multilingual WordNets. 
The English WordNet is used in this 
approach as a backbone for Catalan and 
Spanish WordNets and as a lexical 
knowledge resource for several subtasks. 
1 Motivation and Introduction 
One of the main issues in last years as regards 
NLP activities is the increas ingly  fast 
development of generic language resources. A lot of 
such resources, including both software and 
l ingware items (lexicons, lexical databases, 
grammars, corpora marked in several ways) have 
been made available for research and  industrial 
applications. 
Special interest presents, for knowledge-based 
NLP tasks, the availability of wide coverage 
ontologies. Most known ontologies (as GUM, CYC, 
ONTOS, MICROKOSMOS, EDR or WORDNET, 
see \[Gomez 98\] for an extensive survey) defer in 
great extent on several characteristics (e.g. broad 
coverage vs. domain specific, lexicaUy oriented 
vs. conceptually oriented, granularity, kind of 
information placed in nodes, kind of relations, 
way of building, etc.). It is clear, however, that 
for a wide range of applications, WordNet (WN) 
\[Miller 90\] as become a de-facto standard. 
The success of WordNet has determined the 
emergence of several projects that aim the 
construction ofWordNets for other languages than 
English (e.g., \[Hamp & Feldweg 97\], \[Artale t al. 
97\]) or to develop multilingual WordNets (the 
most important project in this line is 
EuroWordNet (EWN)I). 
lhttp://www.let.uva.rd/~ewn/The aim of EWN vroject 
is to braid a multi.lingual database with WordN'ets for 
several european languages (in the first phase, Dutch, 
Italian and Spanish in addltion to English). 
The construction of a WN for a language Lg 
(LgWN) can be tackled in di f ferent ways 
according to the lexical sources available. Of 
course the manual construction can be undertaken 
quite straightforwardly and leads to the best 
results in terms of accuracy, but has the important 
drawback of its cost. So, other approaches have 
been carried out taking profit of available 
resources in fully automatic or semi-automatic 
ways. 
Which are these lexical resources? Basically 
four kinds of resources have been used: 1) English 
WN (EnWN0, as an initial skeleton for trying to 
attach the words of Lg to it, 2) already existing 
taxonomies ofLg (both at word and at sense level), 
3) bilingual (English and Lg) and 4) monolingual 
(Lg) dictionaries. All the approaches using EnWN 
as skeleton are based on the assumption of a close 
conceptual similarity between English and Lg, in 
such a way that most of the structure (relations) in 
EnWN could be maintained for LgWN. 
In the case of bilingual dictionaries the usual 
approach is to try to link the English counterpart 
of entries to synsets in EnWN and to assume that 
the entry can be \]inked to the same synset. 
Monolingual dictionaries have been used 
basically as a source for extracting taxonomic 
(hypemym) links between words (or senses \[Bruce 
& Guthrie 92\], \[Rigau et al 97\]) and in lower 
extent for extracting other kinds of semantic 
relations \[Richardson 97\] (e.g. meronymic links). 
Once a taxonomy of Lg (already existing or 
built from a monolingual MILD) is available, the 
task can consist of 1) enriching the taxonomic 
structure with other semantic links (manually or 
automatically), as is the case of bui ld ing 
individual WNs, or 2) merging this structure with 
other already existing ontologies (as EnWN or 
EWN). 
This paper presents our approach to the 
construction of WNs for two languages, Spanish 
and Catalan, and linking the first one to EWN. 
We have developed a methodology that uses as 
core source EnWN 2. The methodology implies 1)

The use of EnWN for guiding the selection of the 
basic concepts of our WNs, 2) the use of EnWN as 
skeleton for linking Spanish and Catalan words to 
English synsets using bilingual dictionaries, 3) the 
use of EnWN, together with bilingual and 
monol ingual  dictionaries for allowing the 
construction of taxonomies (at sense level) of our 
languages and 4) the use of EnWN together with 
already built fragments of SpWN and CtWN for 
merging and incorporating these taxonomies toour 
WNs. 
In section 2 an overall description of our 
approach is given. Sections 3, 4 and 5 focus on the 
procedures for extracting connections between 
words/senses/synsets. Section 3 is devoted to 
procedures based on the use of bilinguals, section 4
on the construction of taxonomies and section 5 
deals with the merging method. In all these 
sections we will enphasize the role played by 
EnWN as Knowledge Source. Section 6, finally, 
presents some conclusions of our work. 
2 Our way of bui ld ing WordNets 
As we have pointed out in the introduction, our 
aim has been to design a methodology (and a 
software environment support ing it) for 
facilitating the task of building WNs from our 
sources. As we are involved in EWN project 
(covering the Spanish part), the methodology has 
been defined to be compatible which the general 
approach, guidelines and landmarks of the whole 
project but also to allow a parallel development of
the CtWN. 
The general approach for building EWN is 
described in \[Vossen et al 97\]. Roughly speaking, 
the approach follows a top-down strategy trying 
to assure a high level of overlapping between 
languages, at least in the highest levels of the 
hierarchy, but reflecting the language-specific 
lexicalizations and providing the maximum of 
f reedom and flexibility for bui lding the 
individual WordNets. Basically it consists of 
three major steps: l) Construction of core- 
WordNets for a set of common base concepts 
(around 800 nouns and 200 verbs), 2) enrichment of
these sets providing relational links and 
incorporating their direct semantic ontexts and 3) 
top-down extension of these core-WordNets. 
In our case two different approaches have been 
followed for dealing with nouns and verbs 3. 
3Although other categories can be included in EWN (and 
cross-category elations an be established) only nouns 
and verbs have been introduced until now in our 
WordNets except for demostration purposes. 
In the case of verbs most of the work has been 
performed manually. The main source of 
information has been the Pirapides database 
\[Castell6n et al 97\] that consists of 3,600 English 
verbs forms organized around Levin's Semantic 
Classes connected to WN1.5 senses. The database 
contains the theta-Grids pecifications for each 
verb (its semantic structure in terms of cases or 
thematic roles), translation to Spanish and 
Catalan forms 4 and diathesis information. The 
connections extracted from this database were 
cross-validated with the information provided by 
bilingual dictionaries in order to improve their 
accuracy. 
In the case of nouns we have followed EWN 
strategy in the next way: 
1) The two highest levels of EnWN (top 
concepts and direct hyponyms) were manually 
translated into Spanish (including variants). The 
results were fi ltered dropping out words 
appearing less than five times as genus terms in 
our monolingual dictionary \[DGILE 87\] or occurring 
less than 50 times in DGILE definition corpus 5and 
less than 100 times in LEXESP corpus 6. 
This initial set (Spanish core concepts, 361 
synsets) was then compared with base concept sets 
of other sites of EWN (roughly the union of 
intersection pairs between languages was 
considered as the common base concepts et). The 
missing concepts in Spanish were manually added 
and vertically bottom up extended leading to the 
common Base Concept set (around 800 synsets). 
Catalan Base Concepts et was then built to cover 
the Spanish Base Concepts et. 
2) The enrichment of the BC set has been 
performed in two steps. First, using bilinguals as 
main lexical source, and then using other sources 
(mainly taxonomies). These processes are 
described below. 
3 Using Eng l i sh  WordNet  with  
bil inguals 
When trying to build a lexical taxonomy from 
scratch, we can take profit of a preexisting lexical 
taxonomy, EnWN in our case, assuming it is weU 
formed, as a skeleton of a taxonomy where we will 
fill in the lexical data. This ensures several 
advantages: it speeds up the construction of a 
large lexicon, as the only problem left is the 
4Spanish and Catalan are languages close enough for 
allowing a simultaneous development of lexical sources.

decision where to attach the lexical data. There 
are also some problems: nobody ensures that the 
wellformedness of a lexical taxonomy for a 
language keeps true for another language, there 
must be semantic closeness between both 
languages. We have therefore assumed that the 
structure of the WN taxonomy would suffice in the 
earlier stages of the construction of the our WNs. 
So, we need to choose synonyms in Spanish 7 for 
the English words present in the original synsets 
of WN. One way to fulfil our requirements is using 
bilingual dictionaries (see \[Knight & Luk 94\], 
\[Okumura & Hovy 94\]). But we have to perform a 
sense disambiguation task in order to know which 
sense of both words (the Spanish and the English 
one) is being referred. In other words, we have to 
decide, for which sense of the Spanish word and 
for which synset in WordNet a relation of 
synonymy isbeing defined. 
There is also another minor problem to 
overcome, the unification of the two directions of 
the bilingual dictionary, which in few cases are 
symmetrical, to collect all translations together. 
It is true that unifying both directions of the 
bilingual dictionary implies loss of information 
potentially important (e.g. the order in which 
translations are written is relevant). But the lack 
of systematic work in the construction of the 
bilinguals makes this information of very doubtful 
util ity. 
Thus, we have processed the bilinguals 
creating what we have called the homogeneous 
bilingual, which is a bil ingual with both 
directions mixed. Then, for each Spanish word, we 
have collected all the words given as correct 
translations. And this has been the source for our 
work of attachment of Spanish words to WordNet 
synsets. 
Having collected all the translations of a 
Spanish word together, we  have then classified 
the words in classes depending on their behaviour. 
They can be classified in three dimensions: 
polysemy, structural and conceptual. 
In the polysemy dimension, we  classify the 
words in classes depending on the number and kind 
of translations. For example, all entries that have 
only one translation fall in the same class when 
this translation is monosemous in WN terms; all 
entries that have several translations fall in 
another class when these translations are 
polysemous. 
7Although we ilustrate the methodology considering only 
Spanish, we performed the whole process for both 
Catalan and Spanish (and we provide results for both). 
In the structural  dimension, we classify the 
words in classes depending on the relation that 
the translations owns in WN. For example, all 
entries which have several translations, sharing 
some of them a common synset in WN, fall in the 
same category; all entries in which one 
translation is a direct hyponym of other 
translation fall in the same category, etc. 
In the conceptua l  dimension, we apply the 
conceptual distance formula (which is explained 
in section 4.2.1.) on elements of the entries. For 
example, all entries with a low conceptual 
distance between synsets of their translations fall 
in the same class. 
Each of these classes defines a set of entries 
with the same behaviour. A confidence score has 
been assigned to each class by means of a manual 
validation of a significant sample extracted from 
them. We decided to accept the classes with a 
precission of 85% or more as classes of words to 
include in the first version of SpWN. 
Bilinguals can be used a step further stating a 
supposition: when several methods give the same 
result for the same Spanish word, the confidence 
for this attachment increases. We have carried 
out an experiment checking the classes in pairs, 
evaluat ing the preciss ion of the set of 
intersections, and in all cases the precission 
increased. We have removed the cases where the 
precision was over 85%, the threshold applied in 
the previous experiment. This caused an increment 
of 40% of the original set of attachments. 
Furthermore, it is clear that if we merge more 
bilinguals, the homogeneous resulting will be 
larger, and will then generate larger classes. But, 
what is even more important, the classes are more 
precise because some bilinguals lack the inclusion 
of some translations for some words. Table I shows 
the current figures of both CtWN and SpWN 
following this approach (see \[Atserias et al 97\] 
and \[Benitez et al 98\] for further details of the 
whole process and tools used).

intersecting larger numbers of classes can be 
expected. 
As a matter of fact, the extension of the 
intersection method would be nothing more than 
performing a multivariant statistical analysis, 
where each of the classes would be a factor. The 
interesting result of this multivariant analysis 
would be a formula which could be used to 
calculate the value of the confidence of an 
attachment, depending on the number of classes in 
which it occurs. 
4 Building Taxonomies using WordNet 
4.1 Exploiting taxonomies f~m MRDs 
A straightforward way of obtaining a LgWN 
can be performed acquiring taxonomic relations 
from conventional dictionaries following a purely 
bottom up strategy. That is, 1) parsing each 
? definition for obtaining the genus, 2) performing a 
genus disambiguation procedure, and 3) building a 
natural classification of the concepts as a concept 
taxonomy with several tops. Following this 
purely descriptive methodology, the semantic 
primitives of the LgWN could be obtained by 
collecting those dictionary senses appearing at 
the top of the complete taxonomies derived from 
the dictionary. By characterizing each of these 
tops, the complete LgWN could be produced. For 
DGILE, the complete noun taxonomy was derived 
using the automatic method escribed by \[Rigau et 
al. 97\]8. 
However, several problems arise due to a) the 
source (i.e., circularity, errors, inconsistencies, 
omitted genus, etc.) and b) the limitation of the 
genus sense disambiguation techniques applied 
(i.e., \[Bruce t al. 92\] report 80% accuracy using 
automatic techniques, while \[Rigau et al 97\] 
report 83%). Furthermore, the top dictionary 
senses do not usually represent he semantic 
subsets that the LgWN needs to characterize in
order to represent useful knowledge for NLP 
systems. In other words, there is a mismatch 
between the knowledge directly derived from an 
MRD and the knowledge needed by a LgWN. 
To illustrate the problem we are facing, let us 
suppose we plan to place the FOOD concepts in 
the LgWN. Neither collecting the taxonomies 
derived from a top dictionary sense (or selecting a
8This taxonomy contains 111,624 dictionary senses and 
has only 832 dictionary senses which are tops of the 
taxonomy (these top dictionary senses have no 
hypernyms), and 89,458 leaves (which have no 
hyponyms). That is, 21,334 definitions are placed 
between the top nodes and the leaves. 
subset of the top dictionary senses of DGILE) 
closest tO FOOD concepts (e.g., substancia 
-substance-), nor collecting those subtaxonomies 
starting from closely related senses (e.g., bebida 
-drinkable liquids- and alimento -food-) we are 
able to collect exactly the FOOD concepts present 
in the MRD. The first are too general (they would 
cover non-FOOD concepts) and the second are too 
specific (they would not cover all FOOD 
dictionary senses because FOODs are described in 
many ways). 
All these problems can be solved using a mixed 
methodology. That is, by attaching selected top 
concepts (and its der ived taxonomies) to 
prescribed semantic primitives represented in the 
LgWN. Thus, first, we prescribe a minimal 
ontology (represented by the semantic primitives 
of the LgWN) able to represent the whole lexicon 
derived from the MRD, and second, following a 
descriptive approach, we collect, for every 
semantic primitive placed in the LgWN, its 
subtaxonomies. Finally, those subtaxonomies 
selected for a semantic primitive are attached to 
the corresponding L WN semantic ategory. 
We used as semantic primit ives the 24 
lexicographer's files (or semantic files) into 
which the 60,557 noun synsets (87,641 nouns) of 
WN are classified 9. Thus, we considered the 24 
semantic tags of WN as the main LgWN semantic 
primitives to which all dictionary senses must be 
attached. In order to overcome the language gap 
we also used a bil ingual Span ish /Eng l i sh  
dictionary. 
4.2 Attaching DGILE dictionary senses to semantic 
primitives 
In order to classify all nominal DGILE senses 
with respect to WordNet semantic files, we used a 
similar approach to that suggested by \[Yarowsky 
92\]. This task is div ided into three fully 
automatic onsecutive subtasks. First, we tag a 
subset (due to the difference in size between the 
monolingual and the bilingual dictionaries) of 
DGILE dictionary senses by means of a process 
that uses the conceptual distance formula (see 
4.2.1); second, we collect salient words for each 
semantic file; and third, we enrich each DGILE 
9One could use other semantic lassifications, uch as 
Roget's Thesaurus \[Yarowsky 92\], the LDOCE semantic 
or pracmatic odes \[Slator 91\] or even better, a Spanish 
semantic classification such as the "Diccionario 
IdeolOgico de la Lengua Espafiola J. Casares'" (DILEC). 
Really; when using this methodology a minimal set of 
informed seeds are needed. These seeds can be collected 
from MRDs, thesauri or even by introspection. (see 
\[Yarowsky 95\]).

dictionary sense with a semantic tag collecting 
evidence from the salient words previously 
computed. 
4.2.1 Attaching WordNet synsets to DGILE 
headwords. 
For each DGILE definition, the conceptual 
distance between headword and genus has been 
computed using WN1.5 as a semantic net. We 
obtained results only for those definitions having 
English translations (using a bilingual dictionary) 
for both headword and genus. By computing the 
conceptual distance between two words (wl,w2) 
we are also selecting those concepts (Cli,C2j) which 
represent them and seem to be closer with respect 
to the semantic net used. Conceptual distance is 
computed using formula (1).

I i wl c lGpat l (c l  i "cll ) 
ell E W l 
That is, the conceptual distance between two 
concepts depends on the length of the shortest 
path 10 that connects them and the specificity of 
the concepts in the path. 
In this way, we obtained a preliminary version 
of 29,20511 dictionary definitions semantically 
labelled (that is, with WN lexicographer's files) 
with an accuracy of 64% (61% at a sense level). 
That is, a corpus (collection of dictionary senses) 
classified in 24 partitions (each one corresponding 
to a semantic ategory). 
4.2.2 Collecting the salient words for every 
semantic primitive. 
Thus, we can collect the salient words (that is, 
those representative words for a particular 
category) using a Mutual Information-like formula 
(2), where w means word and SC semantic lass. 
(21 AR(w, SC) = Pr(wlSC)log 2Pr(wlSC) 
Pr(w) 
Intuitively, a salient word  12 appears 
significantly more often in the context of a 
I OWe only consider hypo / hypermy mrelations. 
llDue to the different sizes of the dictionaries used we 
only compute the conceptual distance for 31% of the noun 
dictionary senses. 
12Instead ofword lemmas, this study has been carried out 
using word forms because word forms rather than lemmas 
semantic ategory than at other points in the 
whole corpus, and hence is a better than average 
indicator for that semantic ategory. The words 
selected are those most relevant o the semantic 
category, where relevance is def ined as the 
product of salience and local frequency. That is to 
say, important words should be distinctive and 
frequent. 
We performed the training process considering 
only the content word forms from dictionary 
definit ions 13 and we discarded those salient 
words with a negative score. Thus, we derived a 
lexicon of 23,418 salient words (one word can be a 
salient word for many semantic ategories). 
4.2.3 Enriching DGILE definitions with WordNet 
semantic primitives. 
Using the salient words per category (or 
semantic lass) gathered in the previous step we 
labelled the DGILE dictionary definitions again. 
When any of the salient words appears in a 
definition, there is evidence that the word 
belongs to the category indicated. If several of 
these words appear, the evidence grows. We add 
together their weights, over all words in the 
definition, and determine the category for which 
the sum is greatest, using formula (3). 
(3) W(SCO = ~ AR(w, SCO 
w E defmition 
Thus, we obtained a second semantically 
labelled version of DGILE. This version has 86,759 
labelled definitions (covering more than 93% of 
all noun definitions) with an accuracy rate of 80% 
(we have gained, since the previous labelled 
version, 62% coverage and 16% accuracy). 
Although we used the 24 lexicographer's files 
of WordNet as semantic primitives, a more fine- 
grained classification could be made. For example, 
all FOOD synsets are classified under <food,  
nutrient> synset in file 13. However, FOOD 
concepts are themselves classified into 11 
subclasses (i.e., <yo lk>,  <gast ronomy>,  
<comestible, dible, eatable, ...>, etc.). Thus, if 
the LgWN we are planning to build needs to 
represent <beverage, drink, potable> separately 
from the concepts <comestible, dible, eatable, 
...> a finer set of semantic primitives should be 
chosen, for instance, considering each direct 
hyponym of a synset belonging to a semantic file 
also as a new semantic primitive or even selecting

for each semantic file the level of abstraction we 
need. 
4.3 Selecting the main top beginners for a semantic 
primitive 
This section is devoted to the location of the 
main top dictionary senses for a given semantic 
primitive in order to correctly attach all its 
subtaxonomies to the correct semantic primitive in 
the LgWN. 
In order to illustrate this process we will locate 
the main top beginners for the FOOD dictionary 
senses. However, we must consider that many of 
these top beginners are structured. That is, some of 
them belong to taxonomies derived from other 
ones, and then cannot be directly placed within 
the FOOD type. This is the case of vino (wine), 
which is a zumo (juice). Both are top beginners for 
FOOD and one is a hyponym of the other. 
First, we collect all genus terms from the whole 
set of DGILE dictionary senses labelled in the 
previous section with the FOOD tag (2,614 
senses), producing a lexicon of 958 different genus 
terms (only 309, 32%, appear more than once in the 
FOOD subset of dictionary senses). 
As the automatic dictionary sense labelling is 
not free of errors (around 80% accuracy) 14 we can 
discard some senses by using filtering criteria. 
? Filter I (F1) removes all FOOD genus terms 
not assigned to the FOOD semantic file during the 
mapping process between the bilingual dictionary 
and WN. 
? Filter 2 (F2) selects only those genus terms 
which appear more times as genus terms in the 
FOOD category. That is, those genus terms which 
appear more frequently in dictionary definitions 
belonging to other semantic tags are discarded. 
? Filter 3 (F3) discards those genus terms 
which appear with a low frequency as genus terms 
in the FOOD semantic category. That is, 
infrequent genus terms (given a certain threshold) 
are removed. Thus, F3>1 means that the filtering 
criteria have discarded those genus terms 
appearing in the FOOD subset of dictionary 
definitions less than twice. 
At the same level of genus frequency, filter 2 
(removing enus terms which are more frequent in 
other semantic ategories) is more accurate than 
filter 1 (removing all genus terms the translation 
14Most of them are not really errors. For instance, all 
fishes must be ANIMALs, but some of them are edible 
(that is, FOODs). Nevertheless. all fishes labelled as 
FOOD have been considered mistakes. 
of which cannot be FOOD). For instance, no error 
appears when selecting those genus terms which 
appear 10 or more limes (F3) and are more frequent 
in that category than in any other (F2), discarding 
only 3% of correct genus terms (see \[Rigau et aL 98\] 
for complete figures). 
4.4 Automatically building large scale 
taxonomies from DGILE 
The automatic Genus Sense Disambiguation 
task in DGILE has been performed following 
\[Rigau et al 97\]. This method reports 83% 
accuracy when selecting the correct hypemym by 
combining eight different heuristics using several 
methods and types of knowledge (two of the 
heuristics use WN). 
Once the main top beginners (relevant genus 
terms) of a semantic category are selected and 
every  d ic t ionary  def in i t ion has been  
disambiguated, we collect all those pairs labelled 
with the semantic category we are working on 
having one of the genus terms selected. Using 
these pairs we finally build up the complete 
taxonomy for a given semantic primitive. That is, 
in order to build the complete taxonomy for a 
semantic primitive we fit the lower senses using 
the second labelled lexicon and the genus selected 
from this labelled lexicon. 
Although, both final taxonomic structures 
produce more fiat taxonomies than if the task is 
done manually, a few arrangements could be done 
at the top level of the automatic taxonomies. 
Studying the main top beginners we can easily 
discover an internal structure between them (for 
FOOD, 18 or 48 depending on the criteria 
selected). 
Performing the process for the who le  
dictionary we obtained for F2+(F3>9) a taxonomic 
structure of 35,099 definitions and for F2+(F3>4) 
the size grows to 40,754. Testing the results on 
FOOD taxonomies we achived 99% accuracy with 
the first criterion and 96% with the second. 
5 Extend ing  and  F i l l ing Gaps .  
Up to now we have described a methodology to 
connect words from a language to a WN skeleton, 
and another methodology tobuild taxonomies. 
The words finally connected in the first 
process, apart from the precission threshold 
criterion, do not follow any other criterion: they 
are not the most important, neither the topmost 
nor the lowermost concepts in the hierarchy; the 
connections are scattered all over the skeleton. 
The final set of words connected to the skeleton is 
random, and we don't have any control over it.

Furthermore, we also find relevant words not 
connected to the hierarchy. 
We are currently developing a methodology 
which tries to fill the gaps by merging the 
taxonomy automatically extracted, and the sparse 
skeleton. By now we have studied very simple and 
short structures. 
We have then two hierarchies to compare, and 
two ways of connecting them: the already 
extracted connections (A) between Spanish words 
and synsets, and the translations (B) given by the 
bilinguals (not disambiguated). We have then 
looked for the next simple configurations: 
(4) sp-en 
I I 
sp-en 
where Spanish words are connected between 
them via the automatically extracted taxonomy, 
and the English words via WN. The English 
words can be connected to the Spanish via A or via 
B, or they can be unconnected. Then we obtain 
eight configurations. We have evaluated up to 
now three of these classes: 
? class 1: connections via A above and below 15 
? class 2: connections via A above and B below 
? class 4: connections via B above and A below 
Below there is a table showing volumes. The 
experiment was carried out on four file senses 
which in our opinion would differ in their 
behaviour, food and artifact, which are classified 
very similarly in Spanish and in English, and 
mental process and communication, which are not 
so dear:.

Table 2: class volumes. 
Of these volumes, some were already extracted 
with the previous methods, but some are newly 
produced connections. Some of the already existing 
connections were incorrect, and led to incorrect 
deductions. Of the newly added connections, a
sample has been evaluated, giving the results 
below:

Table 4: results for new connections 
We can then decide, after studying all the 
cases, to accept he connections above a threshold, 
or we can also try to combine them to extract more 
precise ones. For example, some promising 
combinations could be: 
(5) sp - en -  A 
I ! 
sp-en-B  
\[ I 
sp -en - A 
(6) sp - en - A 
I I 
sp -en -no connection 
I I 
sp - en - A 
which are the combinations of classes 2 and 4 - 
in (5), and combinations of two new classes in (6). 
Furthermore, we are planning to apply an 
iterative bootstrapping method taking profit of 
those links with higher confidence scores 
gathered in previous steps (acting as anchors) to 
spread evidence where no connections have been 
found. 
We are also considering the possibility oL not  
only filling gaps in the middle levels of the 
hierarchy, but also to extend the LgWN adding 
subtaxonomies tobottom synsets of WN, trying to 
cover semantic fields specific of Lg not covered by 
the original WN. 
6. Conclusions 
An approach for bui lding in a fast and 
automatic  way substant ia l  f ragments of 
WordNets have been presented. The method uses 
as skeleton English WordNet and extracts its 
knowledge from a variety of lexical sources 
( taxonomies,  mono l ingua l  and b i l ingua l  
dictionaries). Our approach makes extensive uses 
71 
of English WordNet in several steps of the 
building process. The system has been applied to 
build Spanish WordNet (within the framework 
of EuroWordNet) and Catalan WordNet. First, 
following \[Atserias et al 97\], we applied a set of 
complementary techniques for linking Spanish 
and Catalan words collected from a bilingual 
MRDs (for nouns) and lexicons (for verbs) to 
English WordNet. Second, by applying the 
methodology described in section 4 we are able to 
build up accurate taxonomies from monolingual 
MRDs (see \[Rigau et al 97\] and \[Rigau et al 98\]). 
Third, taking profit of both lexical resources (the 
sparse connections produced by the first 
methodology and the taxonomies produced by the 
second) we have presented a novel bootstrapping 
methodology for covering substantial parts of the 
new WordNets not covered previously.
