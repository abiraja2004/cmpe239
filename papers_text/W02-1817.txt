Abstract 
This paper presents a unified solution, which 
is based on the idea of ?roles tagging?, to the 
complicated problems of Chinese unknown words 
recognition. In our approach, an unknown word is 
identified according to its component tokens and 
context tokens. In order to capture the functions of 
tokens, we use the concept of roles. Roles are 
tagged through applying the Viterbi algorithm in 
the fashion of a POS tagger. In the resulted most 
probable roles sequence, all the eligible unknown 
words are recognized through a maximum patterns 
matching. We have got excellent precision and 
recalling rates, especially for person names and 
transliterations. The result and experiments in our 
system ICTCLAS shows that our approach based 
on roles tagging is simple yet effective. 
Keywords: Chinese unknown words recognition, 
roles tagging, word segmentation, Viterbi 
algorithm. 
Introduction 
It is well known that word segmentation is a 
prerequisite to Chinese information processing. 
Previous research and work in word segmentation 
have made great progresses. However, cases with 
unknown words are not satisfactory. In general, 
any lexicon is limited and unable to cover all the 
words in real texts or speeches. According to our 
statistics on a 2,305,896-character news corpus 
from the People's Daily, there are about 1.19% 
unknown words. But they are difficult to be 
recalled and often greatly reduce the recognition 
rate of known words close to them. For example, 
the sentence ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
(Pronunciation: ?Bu Zhang Sun Jia Zheng Zai 
Gong Zuo.?)  has two valid segmentations:  ??
?/???/?/??? (The minister Sun Jiazheng is 
at work) and ??? /?? /?? /?? ? (The 
minister Sun Jia now is at work). ????? is a 
person name in the first, while ???? is another 
name in the latter. Meanwhile, the string ????
?? will lead to overlapping ambiguity and bring a 
collision between the unknown word ???
?? (Sun Jiazheng) and ????(zheng zai; now). 
What?s more, the recognizing precision rates of 
person names, place names, and transliterations are 
91.26%, 69.12%, and 82.83%, respectively, while 
the recalling rates of them are just 68.77%, 60.47%, 
and 78.29%, respectively. (Data from official 
testing in 1999) [Liu (1999)] In a word, unknown 
words recognition has become one of the biggest 
stumbling blocks on the way of Chinese lexical 
analysis. A proper solution is important and 
urgent.  
Various approaches are taken in Chinese 
unknown words recognition. They can be broadly 
categorized into ?one-for-one?, ?one-for-several? 
and ?one-for-all? based on the number of 
categories of unknown words, which can be 
recognized. One-for-one solutions solve a 
particular problem, such as person name 
recognition [Song (1993); Ji (2001)], place name 
recognition [Tan (1999)] and transliteration 
recognition [Sun (1993)]. Similarly, 
one-for-several approaches provide one solution 
for several specific categories of unknown words 
[Lv (2001); Luo (2001)]. One-for-all solutions, as 
far as we know, have not been applicable yet 
[Chen (1999); He (2001)].  
Although currently practicable methods could 
achieve great precision or recalling rates in some 
special cases, they have their inherent deficiencies. 
First of all, rules applied are mostly summarized 
by linguists through painful study of all kinds of 
huge ?special name libraries? [Luo (2001)]. It?s 
time-consuming, expensive and inflexible. The 
categories of unknown words are diverse and the 
amount of such words is huge. With the rapid 
development of the Internet, this situation is 
becoming more and more serious. Therefore, it?s 
very difficult to summarize simple yet thorough 
rules about their compositions and contexts. 
Secondly, the recognition process cannot be 
activated until some ?indicator? tokens are 
scanned in. For instance, possible surnames or 
titles often trigger person name recognition on the 
following 2 or more characters. In the case of 
place name recognition, the postfixes such as 
? ? ?(county), ? ? ?(city) will activate the 
recognition on the previous characters. What?s 
more, these methods tend to work only on the 
monosyllabic tokens, which are obvious fragments 
after tokenization [Luo (2001); Lv (2001)]. It takes 
the risk of losing lots of unknown words without 
any explicit features. Furthermore, this trigger 
mechanism cannot resolve the ambiguity. For 
example, unknown word ????? (Fang Lin Shan) 
maybe a person name ??/???(Fang Linshan) or 
a place name ???/??(Fanglin Mountain). 
This paper presents a one-for-all approach 
based on roles tagging to avoid such problems. 
The process is: tagging tokens after word 
segmentation with the most probable roles and 
making unknown words recognition based on roles 
sequence. The mechanism of roles tagging is just 
like that of a small and simple Part-Of-Speech 
tagger.  
The paper is organized as follows: In section 
2, we will describe the approach in general. 
Following that, we will present the solution in 
practice. In the final part, we provide recognition 
experiments using roles-tagging methods. The 
result and possible problems are discussed as well. 
1 Unknown words recognition based on roles 
tagging  
1.1 Lexical roles of unknown words 
Unknown words are often made up of 
distinctive components, most of which are 
monosyllabic characters or short words; in 
addition, there are some regular relations between 
unknown words and their locality, especially with 
their left and right context. As we often write or 
speak, a Chinese person name is usually comprised 
of a one-or-two-character surname and a following 
given name of one or two characters, like ???
??(Xiao Jianqun) and ?????(Zhu-Ge Liang). 
The  previous words are mostly titles, 
occupations or some conjunctive words, such as 
????(Manager), ????(Driver) and ???(To). 
The following words tend to be verbs such as ??? 
(to say) , ????(to express). Similar components, 
contexts and relations can be discovered in place 
name, transliteration, organization name, or other 
types of unknown words.   
We define unknown word roles with respect 
to varied internal components, previous and 
succeeding contexts and other tokens in a 
particular sentence. Various roles are extracted 
according to their functions in the forming of 
different unknown words. Person names roles and 
transliterations roles set are shown in table 1a and 
1b respectively. Using the roles set of person name, 
the tokens sequence ??/?/??/?/?/?/?/?/
?/??/?/??/?/?/??/? (What Zhou Enlai 
and Deng Yunchao used before death are 
presented in the museum) will be tagged as ??/A 
?/A ??/K ?/B ?/C ?/D ?/M ?/B ?/C 
??/V ?/A ??/A ?/A ?/A??/A?.

1.2 Roles tagging and unknown words recognition 
On the one hand, the sentence include words 
with different roles for a particular category of 
unknown words, on the other hand, such words 
can be recognized after identifying their roles 
sequence. That is: tagging tokens after word 
segmentation with the most probable roles 
sequence, then recognizing unknown words by 
maximum patterns matching on the final roles 
sequence. 
Roles tagging is similar to Part-Of-Speech 
tagging. Our tagging process is based on Viterbi 
Algorithm [Rabiner and Juang (1989)], which is to 
select the optimum with maximum probability 
from all possible tag sequences. The methodology 
and its deduction is given as below: 
Suppose that T is the tokens sequence after 
word segmentation and R is the roles sequence for 
T. We take the role sequence R# with the 
maximum probability as the best choice. That is: 
T=(t1, t 2, ? , t m), 
R=(r1, r2, ? , rm), m>0, 
R#= arg P(R|T)...................?........E1    
R
max
According to the Bayes equation, we can get: 
P(R|T)= P(R)P(T|R)/P(T) ...................E2 
For a particular token sequence, P(T) is a 
constant. So, We can get E3 based on E1 and E2: 
R#= arg P(R)P(T|R) ......................E3 
R
max
We may consider T as the observation value 
sequence while R as the state sequence hidden 
behind the observation. Now we introduce Hidden 
Markov Model [Rabiner and Juang (1986)] to 
resolve such a typical problem:  
P(R) P(T|R)?  ?

1)}|(ln)|({ln
E5 is simpler for computation than E4. 
Now, we can find the most possible token 
sequence with equation E5. It?s a simple 
application of Viterbi Algorithm. 
The final recognition through maximum pattern 
matching is not performed on the original texts but 
performed on roles sequence. The person patterns 
are {BBCD, BBE, BBZ, BCD, BE, BG, BXD, BZ, CD, FB, 
Y, XD}. Before matching, we should split the 
tokens whose roles are like ?U? or ?V?(which 
indicate that the related token is generated by 
internal components and the outside contexts of 
unknown words) into two proper parts. Such a 
processing can recall more unknown words and 
reduce the overlapping collision. As for the above 
sample sentence, the final roles sequence after 
splitting is ?AAKBCDMBCDLAAAAAA?. Therefore, 
we can identify the possible person names ???
?? and ????? according to the recognition 
pattern ?BCD?. 
1.3  Automatic acquisition of roles knowledge 
 As described in E5, the tag sequence R#  is 
decided by two kinds of factors: and 
.  is the probability of a 
token t
)|( ii rtp
)|( 1?ii rrp )|( ii rtp
( irp
i given the condition of being tagged with 
role ri, while  is the transitive 
probability from role r
)| 1?ir
i-1 to role ri. Both factors are 
useful lexical knowledge for tagging and final 
recognition. According to laws of large numbers, if 
the training corpus is large enough, we can acquire 
the roles knowledge as following: 
)|( ii rtp ?C(ti,ri)/C(ri) ................??......... E6 
Where C(ti, ri) is the count of token ti  being role ri; 
and C(ri) is the count of role ri. 
)|( 1?ii rrp ?C(ri-1,ri)/C(ri-1) ........?.?.....?E7 
Where C(ri-1,ri) is the count of role ri-1  followed 
by role ri. 
 C(ti,ri), C(ri) and C(ri-1,ri) are extracted from 
corpus through a training process. The training 
corpus came from one-month news from the 
People?s Daily with 2,305,896 Chinese characters, 
which are manually checked after word 
segmentation and POS tagging (It can be 
downloaded at icl.pku.edu.cn, the homepage of the 
Institute of Computational Linguistics, Peking 
University).  
However, the corpus is tagged with the 
Part-Of-Speech set. Before training, the original 
POS tags should be converted to the proper roles 
by analysing every token in the sentence.  
2 Algorithm and implementation 
The unknown words recognition based on 
roles tagging has three main steps: automatic 
acquisition of roles knowledge from the corpus; 
roles tagging with Viterbi algorithm and unknown 
words recognition through maximum pattern 
matching. 
  Viterbi algorithm is a classic approach in 
statistics. It aims to select the optimum roles 
sequence with maximum possibility from all 
possible results. Our evaluation function for 
decision-making is E5 given in sub-section 1.2. 
Considering the length limitation of this paper, we 
skip the details.  
Therefore, we only provide algorithms for 
roles knowledge learning. In the last part, the 
entire process of unknown words recognition will 
be listed. 
2.1 Roles knowledge learning 
Input: Corpus which is segmented and POS 
tagged 
T: the type of unknown words; 
R: Roles set of T 
Output: C(ti,ri), C(ri) and C(ri-1,ri) 
Algorithm: 
(1) Get one sentence S from corpus C;  
(2) Extract all tokens and POS tags from S; 
(3) Convert all POS tags to roles in T after role 
analysis.  
(4) Store the tokens whose role is not ?A? into the 
recognition lexicons of unknown words T, where 
?A? is not internal components nor context role.  
(5) Calculate the total number C(ti,ri) of token ti  
being role ri. At the same time, count C(ri), which is 
the number of role ri appearances. 
(6) Sum C(ri-1,ri) which is the times of role ri-1 
followed by role ri. 
(7) If no more sentences in the corpus C, exit; else 
go to (1)  
   First of all, we must explain step (3). Our 
corpus is tagged with POS and person, place or 
organization name are tagged with ?nr?, ?ns? or ?nt? 
respectively; Such POS are unique and different 
from noun. Transliterations can be extracted from 
words tagged with ?nr? or ?ns? and through 
analysing its component chars. So we can easily 
locate such kinds of words. Meanwhile, we can 
judge whether a word is unknown by looking it up 
in the core lexicon. Then we can identify roles of 
words according to their locality, which are before 
or following a particular unknown word. 
Here we provide a sample sentence from our 
corpus like ???/r  ??/ns  ??/t  ??/t  
?/n  ??/n  ?/nr  ??/nr  ?/w  ?/nr  ?
?/nr  ??/v?. In step (2), we can extract tokens 
and tags like ????/ ?r?; ????/ ?ns? and so on. 
When we train person recognition roles, firstly, we 
locate person name ??/nr  ??/nr? and ??/nr  
??/nr? just by searching POS ?nr?; Secondly, 
judge whether they are unknown after looking 
them up in the core lexicon; At last we can tag 
unknown words component and their context near 
their locality. So the final roles after conversion 
are ???/A  ??/A ??/A 1?/A ?/A ??
/K ?/B  ?/C?/D ?/M ?/B ?/C?/D ??
/L?. Then we can train the parameters based on 
new segmentation and person recognition roles 
sequence.  
In addition, we train every different kind of 
unknown word on the same corpus individually. 
That is: person roles, place roles and other roles 
are acquired respectively. Therefore, the unknown 
place recognition roles sequence of the above 
sentence may like ???/K  ?/B?/D  ??/L  
??/A  ?/A  ??/K  ?/A ??/A  ?/A  
?/A ??/A  ??/A?. Such a mechanism can 
greatly reduce the problem of sparse data. 
2.2 The entire process of Unknown words 
recognition 
Input: Original sentence S; 
R: the roles set of unknown words; 
P: pattern sets for recognition. 
Output: Possible unknown words of type T. 
Algorithm: 
(1) Word segmentation (we segment words on 
sentence S with N-shortest paths method 
[Hua-Ping ZHANG, Qun LIU (2002)]); 
(2) Tag tokens sequence with roles in set R using 
Viterbi algorithm. Get the roles sequence R# 
with maximum possibility. 
(3) Split tokens whose role is like ?U? or ?V? in the 
person roles. These roles indicate that the 
internal components glue together with their 
context. 
(4) Maximum match final roles sequence to the 
recognition patterns P and record their 
position. 
(5) Generate the candidate unknown words 
according to the result of pattern matching. 
(6) Exclude those candidates which are fit for the 
exclusive rules.(For example, Chinese person 
name can not include non-Chinese chars. ) 
(7) Output the possible unknown words. 
Now, we take person recognition on the 
sentence ?????????????????
????? as exemplification. In the first place, 
we can get the sequence ???/??/??/??/?
/??/?/?/?/?/?/?/?/??/? after rough 
word segmentation; Then we tag it with Viterbi 
algorithm using person recognition roles lexicon 
and transitive array. So, the most probable roles 
sequence is ?AAAAAKBCDMBCDL?.Therefore, 
candidate perosn names ????? and ????? 
can be recognized after maximum string matching. 
3 Experiments and Discussions 
Both close and open recognition test were 
conducted. In the close test, we tested our system 
within the training corpus, which is the knowledge 
base for recognition. Open test, however, is more 
realistic, because it is performed on arbitrary real 
texts outside the training corpus. The corpus in our 
experiments is from 2-months news in 1998 from 
the People?s Daily. 
In this paper, we only provide the recognition 
results of Chinese person and transliterations. The 
recognition of place names and other kind of 
unknown words can get similar performance.

3.3 Discussions 
The traditional ways to test unknown words 
recognition is to collect sentences including 
unknown words and to make recognition 
experiments. Those sentences that haven?t the type 
of unknown words will be excluded from 
experiments in the pre-processing. In our 
experiments, we just take the realistic corpus and 
make no filtering. Therefore, the precision rates 
may be lower but closer to the realistic linguistic 
environment than previous tests. We have made 
experiments in the traditional way and the 
precision rate can be improved by less than 15%. 
In a word, there is no comparable with precision 
rates of previous unknown words recognition 
experiment. 
  In addition, our experiments show that the 
unknown words recognition based on role tagging 
can achieve very high recalling rates. For such a 
problem, recalling is more essential than precision. 
Low recalling rate means that we have no chance 
to recognize many unknown words through any 
efforts in the following steps, although words 
recognized are mostly valid; However, precision 
rate can be greatly improved in other processes, 
such as POS tagging or sentence simple parsing. In 
our system ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing 
Technology, Chinese Lexical System), we can 
exclude most invalid unknown words during POS 
tagging. The precision rate of Chinese person 
names recognition can achieve over 95% after 
POS tagging while the recalling rate is not 
reduced. 
  Our approach is purely corpus-based. We all 
know that, in any usual corpus, unknown words 
are sparsely distributed. If we depend totally on the 
corpus, the problem of sparse data is inevitable. 
But in the fine-tuning of our system, we found 
some countermeasures and successfully solved the 
problem. 
Lexical knowledge from linguists can be 
incorporated into the system. This does not mean 
that we fall back to the old ways. We just demand 
for those general rules about name formation to 
avoid apparent mistakes. As to person name 
recognition, there are several strict restrictions, 
such as the length of name, the order between 
surname and given name. 
Except for enlarging the training corpus, we 
provide two more counteractions: 
Firstly, a ?best n? approach [Hua-Ping ZHANG, 
Qun LIU (2002)], which provides n (n>1) possible 
tag sequences with leading probabilities, is feasible. 
Usually the desired tag sequence could be 
re-targeted or constructed from the best n 
sequences. In this way, we improved the recalling 
rate at the cost of precision rate. But given a better 
recalling, we could remedy in latter stages of 
language processing. When 3 most probable 
sequences are employed, the recalling and 
precision of unknown words in ICTCLAS can be 
enhanced obviously. 
The second resolution is training on a name 
library in addition to training on a corpus. As we 
all know, it?s easier and cheaper to get a person 
name library or other special name libraries than to 
segment and tag a corpus. We could extract the 
inner components relations from the unknown 
words libraries, and then merge these data into the 
roles information from the original corpus. When 
the special name libraries were introduced, both 
precision and recalling rates can be improved. 
Conclusion 
The paper presents a one-for-all approach for 
Chinese unknown words recognition based on 
roles tagging. At first, we define roles set for every 
category of unknown words according to the 
function of tokens, such as internal component or 
contexts. Unknown words are recognized on roles 
sequence, tagged with the roles set using Viterbi 
algorithm. The knowledge about roles is extracted 
from the learning on corpus. Experiments on large 
size corpus verify that the approach based on role 
tagging is simple and applicable.
