The title sentences of scientif ic and engineering papers are 
analyzed by simple parsing strategies, and only eighteen 
fundamental sentential structures are obtained from ten thou- 
sand titles. Title sentences of physics and mathematics of 
some databases in English are translated into Japanese with 
their keywords, author names, journal names and so on by 
using these fundamental structures. The translation accuracy 
for the specific areas of physics and mathematics from INSPEC 
database was about 93%. 
i. INTRODUCTION 
There have been many researches on syntactic analysis of natural language by comput- 
er, but still no reliable grammatical rules are established yet which can be 
applicable to any utterances of a language. Universal grammatical rules for a 
language looks like almost hopeless. Grammatical rules to be prepared depend heavi- 
ly on the text to be analyzed. Hence the concept of subgrammar is introduced. It 
does not necessari ly cover all the different kinds of sentential structures of a 
language. A grammar which covers just the set of expressions to be treated is 
sufficient from the engineering point of view. 
We developed a machine translation system which translates the titles of scientific 
and engineering papers from English into Japanese. More than 98% of the titles in 
scientific and engineering papers are noun phrases, so that the system is designed 
to translate only the noun phrases. The~verbs can be used in the forms of to + 
infinitive , verb-ing, and verb-ed. The system can not treat the embedded sentences 
which are introduced by relative pronouns. 
Then the essential structures the system can treat are composed of simple noun 
phrases, verbs of the forms of to-infinitive, verb-ing, and verb-ed, and preposi- 
tions. Here a simple noun phrase means the juxtaposition (endocentric structure) 
of adject ives nouns, and some other elements. The word order of a simple noun 
phrase can be the same in English and Japanese. The sentential structures obtained 
after parsing each simple noun phrase into a noun is called a skeleton pattern. We 
can expect that the variety of such skeleton patterns is very few for the restrict- 
ed area of titles of scientif ic and engineering papers. 
When the variety is very few, we do not need further syntactic analysis for these 
skeleton patterns. For each skeleton pattern the corresponding Japanese skeleton 
pattern (word order change) can be given. Thus the subgrammar in this system is a 
very peculiar one which is an accumulation of heuristics of the title structures. 
We util ized this specific nature of the titles in our machine translation system. 
The correct translation rate for the wide variety of scientific and engineering 
papers is about 80%, but for the specific areas of physics and mathematics from 
INSPEC database the score was about 93%. The system is now used for the conversion

of English databases into Japanese databases. This system thus opened a way for 
the Japanese people to make access to English databases in their own language. 
2. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TITLE SENTENCES 
Title sentences of scientific and engineering papers in English have the following 
properties from the point of view of translation. 
(I) Nouns in the titles are usually specific terminological words in a particular 
field. The translation of these words into Japanese is almost unique. This makes 
avoid a difficult problem of the selection of proper translation words from several 
candidates, which we encounter in ordinary words. 
(2) Many colloquial expressions exist in the titles. These are regarded as idioms, 
and their internal structures are not analyzed. The whole expressions are stored 
in a dictionary with their Japanese translations. 
(3) A simple noun phrase in English can be translated into Japanese by replacing 
each word into Japanese without any word order change. 
(4) Many of the special terminological words in science and engineering are com- 
pound words. They are treated as such in a dictionary. When the translation of a 
simple noun phrase according to (3) is not acceptable, the phrase is stored in a 
dictionary as a compound word with its translation. Therefore the dictionary look- 
up is done by the longest match principle. 
(5) The word order change in the translation is 0nly possible in the cases where 
verbs and prepositions are used. This word order change can be done at the level 
of skeleton patterns. 
3. DICTIONARY LOOK-UP 
The block diagram of our title translation system is shown in Fig. i. The first 
step is the dictionary look-up of words and idioms. We gathered a lot of specific 
expressions as idioms, such as "time varying (mechanism)", "based on ...", and so 
on. "verb-ing" can be a noun, adjective, and present participle, but there are 
many verb-ing's whose grammatical function is almostunique: accounting, bonding, 
engineering and so on as nouns, superconducting as adjective, and using, determin- 
ing as verbs which demand objects or complements. The dictionary has this informa- 
tion. 
4. CONJUNCTIVE PHRASE 
The second step is the parsing of conjunctive phrases by "and" and "or". As is 
well known there is an ambiguity for the conjunctive phrases of the forms: 
A and B of C , 
Adjective + noun + and + noun, 
and so on. It is very difficult to determine the scope of conjunctive phrases, 
and to get the correct parsing without the detailed semantic analysis. The present 
program parses simply the nearest two terms which have the same parts of speech, 
such as: 
adj. + and + adj. ~ adj. 
verb + and + verb ~ verb 
verb-ing(-ed) + and + verb-ing(-ed) ~ verb-ing(-ed) 
noun + and + noun ---> noun 
Special consideration is given to the following specific conjunctive phrase:

prep. + noun + and + prep. + no~1 ---> (prep. + noun) + and + (prep. + noun) 
---> prep. + noun 
Conjunctive structures such as, 
(noun + prep. + noun) + and + (noun + prep. + noun) 
(adj. + noun) + and + noun 
can not be analyzed correctly. 
5. SIMPLE NOUN PHRASE 
Next step is the parsing of a simple noun phrase, which may include some other 
parts of speeches. The recognition of a simple noun phrase is done by the finite 
automaton model shown in Fig. 2. The recognition starts from the initial state, 
and the proper transfer of the state is done for the sequential input of words. 
When the automaton reaches to the final state the recognition of the end of a 
simple noun phrase is ended. The word order of the corresponding Japanese is the 
same as English within the scope of a simple noun phrase.

6. SPECIAL WORD SEQUENCE 
There  are some particular word sequences which must be treated separately. Typical 
ones are as follows. 
(a) n I + of + n 2 : This word sequence is regarded as a noun after parsing. This 
is translated into the Japanese word order : n 2 + 6) + n I. 
(b) prep. + n (at the beginning of the titles) : An example is "On pattern recog- 
nition". In this case, very tricky treatment is done as "prep. + n ~ n". This 
means that prep. is an accessory to the noun phrase (n) which follows it, and the 
structure of this noun phrase is the main part of the analysis. The translation 
is first done to the noun phrase, and at the final stage the translation of the 
preposition is attached to the end of the translated noun phrase. 
(c) verb-ed + prep. : This structure is just parsed to prep. which has the modi- 
fying term of verb-ed. The Japanese translation is "prep. + verb-ed + ~L~ (pas- 
sive particle). An example is : 
MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM OF TITLES 249 
a paper presented to a conference ---> a paper to a conference 
(presented) 
(conference) (to) (present) (passive) (paper) 
(d) verb-ing + prep. (at the beginning of the titles). An example is "concerning 
to ...". Syntactically "verb-ing" in this case plays the same role as a noun. So 
it is replaced by noun. 
(e) noun + verb-ing + prep. : The determination of the grammatical role of verb- 
ing in this case is very difficult. By the title sentences it is frequent that 
verb-ing is used as a noun (gerund), and the interpretation of 
noun + verb-ing ---> noun + noun ---> noun 
is adopted. 
7. SEMANTICDISAMBIGUATION 
After the parsing of the above particular structures there stil l remain some more 
difficult structures which require semantic treatment. "verb-ing + noun" is a 
typical such structure. Verb-ing can be either a modifying element to the noun, 
or a present participle which requires the noun as an object. An example is: 
measuring temperature ---> ~ ~ ~,~ ~ 
\[temperature) (measuring) 
measuring device ----> ~'\] ~ ~,  
(measuring) (device) 
Therefore the check must be done between the verb and the Noun which follows as to 
whether the noun can be a subject or an object to the verb. 
For this purpose five semantic elements are introduced. These are shown in Table 
\] ith some nouns classified by these elements. The same semantic information is 
u, ~ to denote what kind of nouns can be a subject or an object to a verb. For 
e~ ?le the subject nouns to the verb "measure" have the semantic categories of 
too? and theory, and the object nouns for the verb have the semantic categories of 
physical object, and aspect. By checking these semantic relations the syntactic 
structure and the translation word order are determined. 
verb-ing + noun ---+ verb ~ ~ noun 
(subject) 
verb-ing + noun ---> noun ~ verb ~ $ ... 
(object) 
Table i. Semantic elements 
tool : instrument, machine, probe, etc. 
aspect : velocity, temPerature , resistance, etc. 
physical object : metal, water, oil, waveguide, etc. 
theory : principle, technique, approach, etc. 
unit : cm, degree, etc. 
250 M. NAGAO et ai 
Such semantic checking is performed in the following syntactic structures. 
(i) n + verb-ing : if semantic check does not work, verb-ing is regarded as a 
gerund and is modified by the noun. 
(2) verb-ing + n : if the noun phrase (n) has an article, it is an object of 
the verb. If semantic check does not work, n is regarded 
as an object. 
(3) n I + verb-ing + n 2 : Semantic check between the verb and n , and the verb I and n 2 is done. If semantic check does not work, the 
interpretation is that n I is an object of the verb, 
and verb-ing modifies n 2. 
(4) prep. + verb-ing +prep. : verb-ing is understood as a gerund.

8. SKELETON PATTERN 
The parsing process thus far produces a skeleton pattern for each title sentence. 
For example: 
# An Automated General Purpose Test System for Solid State Oscillators. ! 
(Skeleton) Syste~m for Oscillators (n + prep. + n) 
# A Laser Doppler Technique for Measuring Flow Velocities in High Current 
Arc Discharge. 
(Skeleton) Technique for Measuring Velocities in Discharge. 
(n + prep. + ver-ing + n + prep. + n) 
The skeleton patterns obtained from ten thousand title sentences are astonishingly 
few. These are shown in Table 2, wit h the frequency of occurrence of each pattern 
for about a thousand title sentences of physics and mathematics in INSPEC database. 
The Japanese word order is also given to each skeleton patterns. 
The translation of prepositions is set unique by the present program as shown in 
Table 3. There are of course several cases where different Japanese expressions 
should be adopted for a preposition depending on the context. This is an important 
problem to be solved in the future, e

9 TEST RESULT 
A test result of the title translation from INSPEC database is shown in Table 4. 
Average time necessary for the translation of a title is 0.i second. After the 
translation of i000 titles, the dlctlpnary was updated by the new words which 
appeared in the input data and which were absent in the dictionary. Then the same 
i000 titles were again translated, and the rejection was checked. Then the next 
i000 titles were handled in the same way, and so on.

252 M. NAGAO et al 
With 3000 titles from INSPEC the ~ejected were only 42 titles (1.4%). Many of the 
rejected titles had the structures which the system can not accept, such as normal 
sentential structures, and qhestion forms. The system can only accept the noun 
phrases without any embedded sentential structures by relative pronouns. 
Among the translated titles, about 5% were wrong or ununderstandable. Many of 
these errors came from the wrong parsing of conjunctive phrases. Some examples of 
the translation are shown in Table 5. For some other databases in English the 
correct translation rate was about 80%. This rate depends heavily on the diction- 
ary contents. 
i0. CONCLUSION 
The translation system is now being used on trial basis at Tukuba Research Informa- 
tion Processing System (RIPS) of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. 
The titles, keywords, and some other journal information of INSPEC database are 
translated into Japanese, and a new database in Japanese language is created. 
Retrieval can be done by Japanese language by using Chinese characters and Kana 
letters to this database of INSPEC Japanese version. 
The system seems to be practically usable, and the program is being transferred to 
a few other database centers for their use in the conversion of English database 
into Japanese database.
