Abstract
(Way and Gough, 2005) provide an in-
depth comparison of their Example-Based
Machine Translation (EBMT) system with
a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
system constructed from freely available
tools. According to a wide variety of au-
tomatic evaluation metrics, they demon-
strated that their EBMT system outper-
formed the SMT system by a factor of two
to one.
Nevertheless, they did not test their EBMT
system against a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem. Obtaining their training and test
data for English?French, we carry out a
number of experiments using the Pharaoh
SMT Decoder. While better results are
seen when Pharaoh is seeded with Giza++
word- and phrase-based data compared to
EBMT sub-sentential alignments, in gen-
eral better results are obtained when com-
binations of this ?hybrid? data is used
to construct the translation and probabil-
ity models. While for the most part the
EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b)
outperforms any flavour of the phrase-
based SMT systems constructed in our
experiments, combining the data sets au-
tomatically induced by both Giza++ and
their EBMT system leads to a hybrid sys-
tem which improves on the EBMT system
per se for French?English.
1 Introduction
(Way and Gough, 2005) provide what are to our
knowledge the first published results comparing
Example-Based and Statistical models of Machine
Translation (MT). Given that most MT research car-
ried out today is corpus-based, it is somewhat sur-
prising that until quite recently no qualitative re-
search existed on the relative performance of the two
approaches. This may be due to a number of factors:
the relative unavailability of EBMT systems, the
lack of participation of EBMT researchers in com-
petitive evaluations or the dominance in the MT re-
search community of the SMT approach?whenever
one paradigm finds favour with the clear majority of
MT practitioners, the assumption made by most of
the community is that this way of doing things is
clearly better than the alternatives.
Like (Way and Gough, 2005), we find this regret-
table: the only basis on which such views should
be allowed to permeate our field is following exten-
sive testing and evaluation. Nonetheless, given that
no EBMT systems are freely available, very few re-
search groups are in the position of being able to
carry out such work.
This paper extends the work of (Way and Gough,
2005) by testing EBMT against phrase-based mod-
els of SMT, rather than the word-based models used
in this previous work. In so doing, it provides a
more complete evaluation of the main question at
hand, namely whether an SMT system outperforms
an EBMT system on reasonably large training and
test sets.
We obtained the same training and test data used
183
in (Way and Gough, 2005), and evaluated a num-
ber of SMT systems which use the Pharaoh decoder1
against the Marker-Based EBMT system of (Gough
& Way, 2004b), for French?English and English?
French. We provide results using a range of au-
tomatic evaluation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al,
2002), Precision and Recall (Turian et al, 2003), and
Word- and Sentence Error Rates. (Way and Gough,
2005) observe that EBMT tends to outperform a
word-based SMT model, and our experiments show
that a number of different phrase-based SMT sys-
tems still tend to fall short of the quality obtained
via EBMT for these evaluation metrics. However,
when Pharaoh is seeded with the data sets automati-
cally induced by both Giza++ and their EBMT sys-
tem, better results are seen for French?English than
for the EBMT system per se.
The remainder of the paper is constructed as fol-
lows. In section 2, we summarize the main ideas be-
hind typical models of SMT and EBMT, as well as
the EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b) used in
our experiments. In section 3, we revisit the exper-
iments and results carried out by (Way and Gough,
2005). In section 4, we describe our extensions to
their work, and compare their findings to ours, and
in section 5, present a number of hybrid SMT mod-
els. Finally, we conclude and offer some thoughts
for future work in section 6, and in section 7 present
some further comments on the narrowing gap be-
tween EBMT and phrase-based SMT.
2 Example-Based and Statistical Models of
Translation
A sine qua non for both EBMT and SMT is a set of
sentences in one language aligned with their trans-
lations in another. Although similar in that both
models of translation automatically induce transla-
tion knowledge from this resource, there are signifi-
cant differences regarding both the type of informa-
tion learnt and how this is brought to bear in dealing
with new input.
2.1 EBMT
Given a new input string, EBMT models use three
separate processes in order to derive translations:
1http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/pharaoh/
1. Searching the source side of the bitext for
?close? matches and their translations;
2. Determining the sub-sentential translation links
in those retrieved examples;
3. Recombining relevant parts of the target trans-
lation links to derive the translation.
Searching for the best matches involves determin-
ing a similarity metric based on word occurrences
and part-of-speech labels, generalised templates and
bilingual dictionaries. The recombination process
depends on the nature of the examples used in
the first place, which may include aligning phrase-
structure (sub-)trees (Hearne & Way, 2003) or de-
pendency trees (Watanabe et al, 2003), or using
placeables (Brown, 1999) as indicators of chunk
boundaries.
Another method?and the one used in the EBMT
system used in our experiments?is to use a set
of closed-class words to segment aligned source
and target sentences and to derive an additional set
of lexical and phrasal resources. (Gough & Way,
2004b) base their work on the ?Marker Hypothe-
sis? (Green, 1979), a universal psycholinguistic con-
straint which posits that languages are ?marked?
for syntactic structure at surface level by a closed
set of specific lexemes and morphemes. In a pre-
processing stage, (Gough & Way, 2004b) use 7 sets
of marker words for English and French (e.g. de-
terminers, quantifiers, conjunctions etc.), which to-
gether with cognate matches and mutual information
scores are used to derive three new data sources: sets
of marker chunks, generalised templates and a lexi-
con.
In order to describe this in more detail, we revisit
an example from (Gough & Way, 2004a), namely:
(1) each layer has a layer number =?chaque
couche a un nombre de la couche
From the sentence pair in (1), the strings in (2)
are generated, where marker words are automati-
cally tagged with their marker categories:
184
(2) <QUANT> each layer has <DET> a
layer number =?<QUANT> chaque
couche a <DET> un nombre <PREP>
de la couche
Taking into account marker tag information (label,
and relative sentence position), and lexical similar-
ity, the marker chunks in (3) are automatically gen-
erated from the marker-tagged strings in (2):
(3) a. <QUANT> each layer has: <QUANT>
chaque couche a
b. <DET> a layer number: <DET> un
nombre de la couche
(3b) shows that n:m alignments are possible (the two
French marker chunks un nombre and de la couche
are absorbed into one following the lexical similari-
ties between layer and couche and number and nom-
bre, respectively) given the sub-sentential alignment
algorithm of (Gough & Way, 2004b).
By generalising over the marker lexicon, a set
of marker templates is produced by replacing the
marker word by its relevant tag. From the examples
in (3), the generalised templates in (4) are derived:
(4) a. <QUANT> layer has: <QUANT>
couche a
b. <DET> layer number: <DET> nombre
de la couche
These templates increase the robustness of the sys-
tem and make the matching process more flexible.
Now any marker word can be inserted after the rele-
vant tag if it appears with its translation in the lexi-
con, so that (say) the layer number can now be han-
dled by the generalised template in (4b) and insert-
ing a (or all) translation(s) for the in the system?s
lexicon.
2.2 Word- and Phrase-Based SMT
SMT systems require two large probability tables in
order to generate translations of new input:
1. a translation model induced from a large
amount of bilingual data;
2. a target language model induced from a(n even)
large(r) quantity of separate monolingual text.
Essentially, the translation model establishes the
set of target language words (and more recently,
phrases) which are most likely to be useful in trans-
lating the source string, while the language model
tries to assemble these words (and phrases) in the
most likely target word order. The language model
is trained by determining all bigram and/or trigram
frequency distributions occurring in the training
data, while the translation model takes into account
source and target word (and phrase) co-occurrence
frequencies, sentence lengths and the relative sen-
tence positions of source and target words.
Until quite recently, SMT models of translation
were based on the simple word alignment models
of (Brown et al, 1990). Nowadays, however, SMT
practitioners also get their systems to learn phrasal
as well as lexical alignments (e.g. (Koehn et al,
2003); (Och, 2003)). Unsurprisingly, the quality
obtained by today?s phrase-based SMT systems is
considerably better than that obtained by the poorer
word-based models.
3 Comparing EBMT and Word-Based
SMT
(Way and Gough, 2005) obtained a large translation
memory from Sun Microsystems containing 207,468
English?French sentence pairs, of which 3,939 sen-
tence pairs were randomly extracted as a test set,
with the remaining 203,529 sentences used as train-
ing data. The average sentence length for the En-
glish test set was 13.1 words and 15.2 words for the
corresponding French test set. The EBMT system
used was their Marker-based system as described in
section 2.1 above. In order to create the necessary
SMT language and translation models, they used:
? Giza++ (Och & Ney, 2003);2
? the CMU-Cambridge statistical toolkit;3
? the ISI ReWrite Decoder.4
Translation was performed from English?French
and French?English, and the resulting translations
were evaluated using a range of automatic metrics:
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), Precision and Recall
2http://www.isi.edu/?och/Giza++.html
3http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/?prc14/toolkit.html
4http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/rewrite-decoder/
185
(Turian et al, 2003), and Word- and Sentence Error
Rates. In order to see whether the amount of train-
ing data affected the (relative) performance of the
EBMT and SMT systems, (Way and Gough, 2005)
split the training data into three sets, of 50K (1.1M
words), 100K (2.4M words) and 203K (4.8M words)
sentence pairs (TS1?TS3 in what follows).
3.1 English?French Results

Way, 2004b) with a Word-Based SMT (WB-SMT) system for

TS3 WB-SMT .3223 .6513 .5704 53.5 89.1
EBMT .4409 .6727 .6877 52.4 65.6
The results obtained by (Gough & Way, 2004b)
for English?French for their EBMT system and
word-based SMT (WB-SMT) are given in Table 1.
Essentially, all the automatic evaluation metrics bar
one (Precision) suggest that EBMT can outperform
SMT from English?French. Surprisingly, however,
apart from SER, all evaluation scores are higher us-
ing 100K sentence pairs as training data rather than
the full 203K sentences. It is generally assumed that
increasing the size of the training data for corpus-
based MT systems will improve the quality of the
output translations. (Way and Gough, 2005) observe
that while this dip in performance may be due to a
degree of over?fitting, they intend to carry out some
variance analysis on these results (e.g. performing
bootstrap-resampling on the test set (Koehn, 2004)),
or re-test with different sample test sets in order
to investigate whether the same phenomenon is ob-
served.
With respect to SER, however, for both SMT and
EBMT, the figures improve as more training data is
made available. However, the improvement is much
more significant for EBMT (20.6%) than for SMT
(0.1%). While the WER scores are much the same,
indicating that both systems are identifying reason-
able target vocabulary that should appear in the out-
put translation, the vast differences in SER using
TS3 indicate that a system containing essentially no
information about target syntax has very little hope
of arranging these target words in the right order.
On the contrary, even a system containing some ba-
sic knowledge of how phrases fit together such as
the Marker-based EBMT system of (Gough & Way,
2004b) will generate translations of far higher qual-
ity.

EBMT .4611 .6782 .7441 50.8 51.2
The results obtained by (Way and Gough, 2005)
for French?English translations are presented in Ta-
ble 2. Translating in this language direction is inher-
ently ?easier? than for English?French as far fewer
agreement errors and cases of boundary friction are
likely. Accordingly, all WB-SMT results in Table 2
are better than for the reverse direction, while for
EBMT, improved results are to be seen for BLEU,
Recall and SER.
While the majority of metrics obtained for
English?French indicate that EBMT outperforms
WB-SMT, the results for French?English are by no
means as conclusive. Of the 15 tests, WB-SMT out-
performs EBMT in nine.
4 Comparing EBMT and Phrase-Based
SMT
From the results in the previous sections for French?
English and for English?French, (Way and Gough,
2005) observe that EBMT outperforms WB-SMT in
the majority of tests. If we are to treat each of the
metrics as being equally significant, it can be said
that EBMT appears to outperform WB-SMT by a
factor of two to one. In fact, the only metric for
which EBMT seems to consistently underperform
is precision for French?English which, when we
examine WER, indicates that the EBMT system?s
knowledge of word correspondences is incomplete
and not as comprehensive as that of the WB-SMT
system.
186
However, it has been apparent for some time now
that phrase-based SMT outperforms previous sys-
tems using word-based models. The results obtained
by (Way and Gough, 2005) for SER also indicate
that if phrase-based SMT were used, then improve-
ments in translation quality ought to be seen.
Accordingly, in this section we describe a set
of experiments which extends the work of (Way
and Gough, 2005) by evaluating the Marker-based
EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b) against a
phrase-based SMT system built using the following
components:
? Giza++, to extract the word-level correspon-
dences;
? The Giza++ word alignments are then refined
and used to extract phrasal alignments ((Och &
Ney, 2003); or (Koehn et al, 2003) for a more
recent implementation);
? Probabilities of the extracted phrases are calcu-
lated from relative frequencies;
? The resulting phrase translation table is passed
to the Pharaoh phrase-based SMT decoder
which along with SRI language modelling
toolkit5 performs translation.
4.1 English?French Results

sentential alignments for English?French.

TS3 GIZA-DATA .3753 .6598 .5879 58.5 86.82
EBMT-DATA .3643 .6661 .5759 61.33 87.99
We seeded the phrase-based SMT system con-
structed from the publicly available resources listed
above with the word- and phrase-alignments derived
via both Giza++ and the Marker-Based EBMT sys-
tem of (Gough & Way, 2004b). Using the full 203K
training set of (Gough & Way, 2004b), and testing
on their near 4K test set, the results are given in Ta-
ble 3. It is clear to see that the Giza++ alignments
obtain better scores than the EBMT sub-sentential
data. Before one considers the full impact of these
results, one should take into account that the size of
5http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/
the EBMT data set (word- and phrase-alignments)
is 403,317, while there are over four times as many
SMT sub-sentential alignments (1,732,715).
Comparing these results with those in Table 1,
we can see that for the same training-test data,
the phrase-based SMT system outperforms the WB-
SMT system on most metrics, considerably so with
respect to BLEU score (.3753 vs. .3223). WER,
however, is somewhat worse (.585 vs. .535), and
SER remains disappointingly high. Compared to
the EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b), the
phrase-based SMT system still falls well short with
respect to BLEU score (.4409 for EBMT vs. .3573
for SMT), and again, notably for SER (.656 EBMT,
.868 SMT).
4.2 French?English Results

sentential alignments for French?English.

EBMT-DATA .3952 .6151 .6643 74.77 86.21
Again, the phrase-based SMT system was seeded
with the Giza++ and EBMT alignments, trained on
the full 203K training set, and tested on the 4K test
set. The results are given in Table 4. As for English?
French, the Giza++ alignments obtain better scores
than when the EBMT sub-sentential data is used.
Comparing these results with those in Table 2, we
see that the phrase-based SMT system actually does
worse than WB-SMT, which is an unexpected re-
sult6. As expected, therefore, the results for phrase-
based SMT here are worse still compared to EBMT.
5 Towards Hybridity: Merging SMT and
EBMT Alignments
We decided to experiment further by combining
parts of the EBMT sub-sentential alignments with
parts of the data induced by Giza++. In the follow-
ing sections, for both English?French and French?
English, we seed the Pharaoh phrase-based SMT
system with:
6The Pharaoh system is untuned, so as to provide an easily
replicable baseline for other similar research. It is quite possible
that with tuning the phrase-based SMT system will outperform
the word-based system.
187
1. the EBMT phrase-alignments with the Giza++
word-alignments;
2. all the EBMT and Giza++ sub-sentential align-
ments (both words and phrases).
5.1 Giza++ Words and EBMT Phrases
Here we seeded Pharaoh with the word-alignments
induced by Giza++ and the EBMT phrasal chunks
only (i.e. no Giza++ phrases and no EBMT lexical
alignments).
5.1.1 English?French Results

Using the full 203K training set of (Gough &
Way, 2004b), and testing on their near 4K test set,
the results are given in Table 5. Comparing these
figures to those in Table 3, we can see that all au-
tomatic evaluation metrics improve with this hybrid
system configuration. Note that the data set size is
430,336, compared to 1.73M for the phrase-based
SMT system seeded solely with Giza++ alignments.
With respect to the EBMT system per se in Table 1,
these results remain slightly below those figures (ex-
cept for precision).

Running the same experimental set up for the re-
verse language direction gives the results in Table 6.
While recall drops slightly, all the other metrics
show a slight increase compared to the performance
obtained when Pharaoh is seeded with Giza++ word-
and phrase-alignments (cf. Table 4).
5.2 Merging All Data
The following two experiments were carried out by
seeding Pharaoh with all the EBMT and Giza++
sub-sentential alignments, i.e. both words and
phrases.
5.2.1 English?French Results

sentential alignments for English?French.

TS3 .4259 .7026 .6099 54.26 83.63
Inserting all Giza++ and EBMT data into
Pharaoh?s knowledge sources gives the results in Ta-
ble 7. These are considerably better than the scores
for the ?semi-hybrid? system described in section
5.1.1. This indicates that a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem is likely to perform better when EBMT word-
and phrase-alignments are used in the calculation of
the translation and target language probability mod-
els. Note, however, that the size of the data set in-
creases to over 2M items. Despite this, compared to
the results for the EBMT system of (Gough & Way,
2004b) shown in Table 1, these results for the ?fully
hybrid? SMT system still fall somewhat short (ex-
cept for Precision: .6727 vs. .7026).
5.2.2 French?English Results

sentential alignments for French?English.

TS3 .4888 .6927 .7173 56.37 78.42
Carrying out a similar experiment for the reverse
language direction gives the results in Table 8. This
time this hybrid SMT system does outperform the
EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b), with re-
spect to BLEU score (.4888 vs .4611) and Precision
(.6927 vs. 6782), but the EBMT system still wins
out where Recall, WER and SER are concerned. Re-
garding this latter, it seems that the correlation be-
tween low SER and high BLEU score is not as im-
portant as is claimed in (Way and Gough, 2005).
6 Conclusions
(Way and Gough, 2005) carried out a number of ex-
periments designed to test their large-scale Marker-
Based EBMT system described in (Gough & Way,
2004b) against a WB-SMT system constructed from
publicly available tools. While the results were a lit-
tle mixed, the EBMT system won out overall.
188
Nonetheless, WB-SMT has long been abandoned
in favour of phrase-based models. We extended
the work of (Way and Gough, 2005) by performing
a range of experiments using the Pharaoh phrase-
based decoder. Our main observations are as fol-
lows:
? Seeding Pharaoh with word- and phrase-
alignments induced via Giza++ generates bet-
ter results than if EBMT sub-sentential data is
used.
? Seeding Pharaoh with a ?hybrid? dataset of
Giza++ word alignments and EBMT phrases
improves over the baseline phrase-based SMT
system primed solely with Giza++ data. This
would appear to indicate that the quality of the
EBMT phrases is better than the SMT phrases,
and that SMT practitioners should use EBMT
phrasal data in the calculating of their language
and translation models, if available.
? Seeding Pharaoh with all data induced by
Giza++ and the EBMT system leads to the best-
performing hybrid SMT system: for English?
French, as well as EBMT phrasal data, EBMT
word alignments also contribute positively, but
the EBMT system per se still wins out (except
for Precision); for French?English, however,
our hybrid Example-Based SMT system out-
performs the EBMT system of (Gough & Way,
2004b) (cf. Table 9).

ing both the full Giza++ and full EBMT data against the EBMT

A number of avenues of further work remain open
to us. We would like to extend our investigations
into hybrid example-based statistical approaches to
machine translation by experiment with seeding the
Marker-Based system of (Gough & Way, 2004b)
with the SMT data, and combinations thereof with
the EBMT sub-sentential alignments, to investigate
the effect on translation quality. Given our find-
ings here, we are optimistic that ?hybrid statistical
EBMT? will outperform the baseline EBMT system,
and that our findings will prompt EBMT practition-
ers to augment their data resources with SMT align-
ments, something which to our knowledge is cur-
rently not done. In addition, we intend to continue
this line of research on different and larger data sets,
and for other language pairs.
7 Final Remarks
Finally, as (Way and Gough, 2005) observe, it is dif-
ficult to explain why to this day SMT practitioners
have not made full use of the large body of existing
work on EBMT, from (Nagao, 1984) to (Carl & Way,
2003) and beyond, which has contributed greatly to
the field of corpus-based MT.
From its very inception EBMT has made use of a
range of sub-sentential data ? both phrasal and lexi-
cal ? to perform translations whereas, until quite re-
cently, SMT models of translation were based on the
relatively simple word alignment models of (Brown
et al, 1990). With the advent of phrase-based SMT
systems the line between EBMT and SMT has be-
come significantly blurred, yet we are still unaware
of any papers on SMT which acknowledge their
debt to EBMT or which describe their approach as
?example?based?.
Despite it becoming increasingly difficulty to dis-
tinguish between EBMT and (phrase?based) SMT
models of translation, some differences still exist.
Rather than using models of syntax in a post hoc
fashion, as is the case with most SMT systems, an
EBMT model of translation builds in syntax at its
core. Given this, a phrase?based SMT system is
more likely to ?learn? chunks that an EBMT sys-
tem would not, as the system learns n-gram se-
quences rather than syntactically-motivated phrases
per se. Furthermore, our research here has demon-
strated quite clearly that if available, merging SMT
and EBMT data improves the quality of the result-
ing hybrid SMT system, as phrases extracted by both
methods that are more likely to function as syntac-
tic units (and therefore be more beneficial during
the translation process) are given a higher statistical
significance. Conversely, the probabilities of those
?less useful? SMT n-grams that are not also gener-
189
ated by the EBMT system are reduced. Essentially,
the EBMT data helps the SMT system to make the
best use of phrase alignments during translation.
Moreover, we see the fact that it is becoming in-
creasingly difficult to describe the differences be-
tween EBMT and SMT as a good thing, and that
as here, this convergence can lead to hybrid systems
capable of outperforming leading EBMT systems as
well as state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT.
We hope that the research presented here,
together with that begun by (Way and Gough,
2005), will lead to new areas of collaboration
between both sets of researchers, to the clear benefit
of the MT research community and the wider public.
