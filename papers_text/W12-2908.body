Abstract
Tactile maps are important substitutes for vi-
sual maps for blind and visually impaired peo-
ple and the efficiency of tactile-map reading
can largely be improved by giving assisting ut-
terances that make use of spatial language. In
this paper, we elaborate earlier ideas for a sys-
tem that generates such utterances and present
a prototype implementation based on a seman-
tic conceptualization of the movements that the
map user performs. A worked example shows
the plausibility of the solution and the output
that the prototype generates given input derived
from experimental data.
1 Introduction
Humans use maps in everyday scenarios. Especially
for blind and visually impaired people, tactile maps
are helpful accessible substitutes for visual maps
(Espinosa, Ungar, Ochaita, Blades, & Spencer, 1998;
Ungar, 2000). However, tactile maps are less efficient
than visual maps, as they have to be read sequen-
tially. A further problem of physical tactile maps is
restricted availability. While physical tactile maps are
rarely available and costly to produce, modern haptic
human-computer interfaces can be used to present
virtual variants of tactile maps (virtual tactile maps)
providing a similar functionality. For example, the
Sensable Phantom Omni device used in our research
enables a user to feel virtual three-dimensional ob-
jects (see Figure 1). It can be thought of as a reverse
robotic arm that makes virtual haptic perception pos-
sible by generating force feedback. In the context of
the research discussed, these objects are virtual tac-
tile maps. These consist of a virtual plane on which
streets and potential landmarks (such as buildings)
are presented as cavities.
In recent work, Habel, Kerzel, and Lohmann
(2010) have suggested a multi-modal map called
Verbally Assisting Virtual-Environment Tactile Map
(VAVETaM) with the goal to enable more efficient
acquisition of spatial survey (overview) knowledge
for blind and visually impaired people.
VAVETaM extends the approaches towards multi-
modal maps (see Section 2) by generating situated
spatial language. The prototype described reacts to
the user?s exploration movements more like a human
verbally assisting a tactile map reader would do, e.g.,
by describing spatial relations between objects on
the map. The users may explore the map freely, i.e.,
they choose which map objects are of interest and
in which order they explore them. This demands for
situated natural language generation (Roy & Reiter,
2005), which produces timely appropriate assisting
utterances. Previously, the suggested system has not
been implemented.
The goal of this paper is to show that the ideas of
Lohmann, Kerzel, and Habel (2010) and Lohmann,
Eschenbach, and Habel (2011) can be implemented
in a prototype which is able to generate helpful as-
sisting utterances; that is, to show that the language-
generation components of VAVETaM are technically
possible. The remainder of the paper is structured as
follows: We first briefly survey some related work
in Section 2, and then describe the overall structure
of VAVETaM in Section 3. We then present a de-
scription of our system in Section 4 paying special
attention to the input to natural language generation
(Subsection 4.1) and the generation component itself
(Subsection 4.2). We show the appropriateness of the
approach by discussing an example input, the pro-

ization of a Virtual Tactile Map.
cesses performed, and the automatically generated
output in Section 5 before we close with concluding
remarks in Section 6.
2 Related Work
To make maps more accessible for visually impaired
people by overcoming drawbacks of uni-modal tac-
tile maps, a number of multi-modal systems that com-
bine haptics and sound have been developed. An
early system is the NOMAD system. It is based on
a traditional physical tactile map, which is placed
on a touch pad. The system allows for the associa-
tion of sound to objects on the map (Parkes, 1988,
1994). The approach to use traditional physical tac-
tile maps as overlays on touch pads has been used
in various systems that were developed subsequently
(e.g., Miele, Landau, & Gilden, 2006; Wang, Li,
Hedgpeth, & Haven, 2009). Overviews of research
on accessible maps for blind and visually impaired
people can be found in Buzzi, Buzzi, Leporini, and
Martusciello (2011) and in De Almeida (Vasconcel-
los) and Tsuji (2005). Other researchers have ad-
vanced the way haptic perception is realized by using
more flexible human-computer-interaction systems
that do not need physical tactile map overlays. For
example, Zeng and Weber (2010) have proposed an
audio-tactile system which is based on a large-scale
braille display and De Felice, Renna, Attolico, and
Distante (2007) presented the Omero system, which
makes use of a virtual haptic interface similar to the
interface used in our research.
Existing systems work on the basis of sounds or
canned texts that are associated to objects or areas
on the map. Sound playback starts when the user
touches a map object or, in some systems, by click-
ing or tapping on it. Yet, when humans are asked to
verbally assist a virtual tactile map explorer, they
produce assisting utterances in which they make
much more use of spatial language and give brief
augmenting descriptions of the objects that are cur-
rently explored and their surroundings (Lohmann et
al., 2011). Based on this, Lohmann and colleagues
suggest which informational content should be in-
cluded in assisting utterances for a tactile-map read-
ing task. Among the types of information that are
suggested for verbal assisting utterances is informa-
tion allowing for identification of objects, e.g., by
stating its name (e.g., ?This is 42nd Avenue?); in-
formation about the spatial relation of objects (?The
church is above the museum?); and talking about
the ends of streets that are explored (?This street is
restricted to the left by the map frame?).
Empirical (Wizard-of-Oz-like) research with 24
blindfolded sighted participants has concerned an
audio-tactile system that makes use of assisting ut-
terances containing the information discussed above
and shown its potential. Different outcome measures,
among them sketch maps and a verbal task, showed
an improved knowledge acquisition with verbal as-
sisting utterances compared to a baseline condition in
which participants verbally only received information
about the names of objects (Lohmann & Habel, forth-
coming). Empirical research with blind and visually
impaired people is ongoing. Data from the ongoing
experiment with blind and visually impaired partic-
ipants is used to show the function of the system in
Section 5.
3 The Structure of VAVETaM
In this section we will recap the overall structure of
VAVETaM as presented by Habel et al. (2010) and
Lohmann et al. (2010). Figure 2 depicts the relevant
parts of the structure.

knowledge base forms the basis for rendering the
tactile map, for analyzing movements, and for verbal-
izing assistive utterances forming the central knowl-
edge component in the architecture.
Knowledge needed for natural-language genera-
tion is represented in a propositional format which
is linked to knowledge needed for movement classi-
fication and for the haptic presentation of the map.
The latter is stored in a spatial-geometric, coordinate-
based format. The knowledge for assistance gener-
ation is represented using the Referential-Nets for-
malism developed by Habel (1986) and successfully
used by Guhe, Habel, and Tschander (2004) for nat-
ural language generation. Knowledge for verbaliza-
tion is organized by interrelated Referential Objects
(RefOs), which are the potential objects of discourse.
A referential object consists of an identifier for the
object (an arbitrary string, for example pt3), addi-
tional associated information such as the sort of the
object, and associated propositional information that
can be verbalized (such as the name of the object
and relations to other objects, e.g., that the object is
?left of? another object). Important sorts of objects
in the map domain are potential landmarks, regions,
the frame of the map, and tracks and track segments1.
See Lohmann et al. (2011) for a discussion of the
propositional layer of the VETM knowledge base.
The Haptic Device provides a stream of position
data. This stream of data is the input to the Map-
Exploratory-Procedures Observer (MEP Observer)
component and its subcomponents which analyzes
the movements the map user performs. By categoriz-
ing the movements and specifying them with identi-

The meaning of the term is similar to the meaning of the term
?path? introduced by Lynch (1960).
fiers of the objects currently explored by the user, a
conceptualization of the user?s movements is created
that is suitable as input to the component dealing
with assisting-utterance generation. For the case of
tactile-map explorations, different circumstances af-
fect which information shall be given via natural
language in an exploration situation: (a) what kind
of information is the user is trying to get (exploration
category), (b) about which object the user is trying
to get information, and (c) what has happened before
(history).
The Map-Knowledge Reasoning (MKR) compo-
nent serves as memory for both the MEP Observer
and the GVA component by keeping track of ver-
bal and haptic information that has been presented
to the user. This component hence helps to avoid
unnecessary verbal repetitions.
The Generation of Verbal Assistance (GVA) com-
ponent, which is at the core of the prototype that
we will present in Section 4, solves the central task
of natural language generation. This component se-
lects the knowledge that is suitable for verbalization
in an exploration situation from the VETM knowl-
edge base and prepares it in a way appropriate for
further output. It sends preverbal messages (PVMs,
see Levelt, 1989), propositional representations of
the semantics of the planned utterance, to the Formu-
lation & Articulation components for the generation
of a surface structure and final utterance.
4 Description of the Prototype
In order to show how an artificial system is able to
generate situated assistance in a well-formed fashion,
we present a prototype implementation of the core
components for natural language generation in the
VAVETaM system.
58
We implemented dummy components in place for
the Map-Knowledge Reasoning (MKR) and MEP
Observer components to allow us to test the natural
language output. The MKR Simulator provides basic
functions sufficient to avoid unnecessary repetitions
of utterances by preventing production of the same
message for a defined time period. An exception
to this rule are those messages that are needed to
identify an object on the map, such as ?This is Dorfs-
tra?e?, which are given every time the user touches
an object.2 The MEP Simulator generates input to
the component as the MEP Observer is planned to
do (see Kerzel & Habel, 2011, for a discussion of a
possible technical realization).
In the following subsection, we will discuss Map-
Exploratory Procedures (MEPs), which are output
by the MEP Observer and form the basic input to
the generation component (GVA), which we then
discuss in Subsection 4.2. Finally, we present the
inner workings of the Formulation & Articulation
components in Subsection 4.3.
4.1 Conceptualization of the User?s Movements
One of the core challenges for situated natural lan-
guage generation is to timely connect the user?s per-
cepts (in the case of virtual-tactile-map exploration
indicated by movements that the user performs with
the device) to symbolic natural language (Roy &
Reiter, 2005). The task to be solved is to have a
well-specified conceptualization of exploration situa-
tions. An exploration situation is constituted by the
kind of movements the user performs, the map ob-
jects the user wants to gain knowledge about (which
constitutes the haptic focus (Lohmann et al., 2011)),
and the haptic exploration and verbalization history.
In the structure of the VAVETaM system, the MEP
Observer fulfills the task of categorizing the user?s
movements and detecting objects in the haptic focus.
Lohmann et al. (2011) discuss how Map-Exploratory
Procedures (MEPs), a specialization of Exploratory
Procedures, introduced as categories of general hap-
tic interaction by Lederman and Klatzky (2009), can
be used to categorize the map user?s movements.
MEP types are shown in Table 1.
For example, a trackMEP is, straightforwardly,

sary to recognize the haptic objects.

characterized by a track-following movement indi-
cating that the user wants to know something about
a track object. MEPs are (optionally) specified with
identifier(s) that link objects on the propositional
layer of the VETM knowledge base as belonging to
the haptic focus of the MEP.
In this work, we extend the concept to be able to
cope with multiple objects or parts of objects that
can simultaneously be in the user?s haptic focus. The
following example illustrates overlapping haptic foci
(see Figure 3). Consider the track with the name
?Dorfstra?e? being represented as track object pt5 on
the propositional layer of the VETM knowledge base.
If the track pt5 forms a dead end, this dead end can
additionally be represented as a unique track segment
object (pts55). When the user explores the track pt5
from the left to the right, at a certain point, both pt5
and pts55 are in the haptic focus.
Since the user is exploring a track, the movement
is characterized by a trackMEP which is specified
by the objects pt5 and pts55 and either will be in the
primary haptic focus.3 Thus, in this case, pts55 is in

the secondary haptic focus. It is reasonable to talk
about both, the track and the dead end itself. As a
notational convention, we denote MEPs by their type,
the object in primary focus (if available), and a (possi-
bly empty) list of objects in secondary focus. For the
example above, we write trackMEP(pt5, [pts55]).
4.2 Structure of the Generation Component
The focus of our prototype is on the GVA component
of the VAVETaM system that solves the ?What to
say?? task, the task of determining the content appro-
priate for utterance in an exploration situation (Reiter
& Dale, 2000; De Smedt, Horacek, & Zock, 1996).
This component interacts with different components
introduced above (see Section 3): (1) it receives the
conceptualization of the user?s movements (MEPs
and specifications) from the MEP Observer; (2) it
accesses the propositional layer of the VETM knowl-
edge base in order to retrieve information about the
objects that is suitable for verbalization; (3) it inter-
acts with the MKR component, which keeps track of
the exploration and verbalization history; and (4) it
then sends semantic representations in the form of
preverbal messages (PVMs) to the Formulation &
Articulation components.
The GVA component consists of several subcom-
ponents which are visualized in Figure 4. The GVA
Controller controls the execution of other processes
through controlling the Agenda, which is an ordered
list of preverbal-message representations of utter-
ances.4 Once the GVA component receives a (spec-
ified) MEP describing the user?s movements from
the MEP Observer, it looks up Utterance Plans &
focussed primarily upon is up to the MEP Observer component.
4The term ?Agenda? is used in a similar context in the Colla-
gen system (Rich, Sidner, & Lesh, 2001).
Agenda Operations that specify which information to
express is suitable in the given exploration situation
and where it should be placed on the Agenda. The
PVM Construction component searches an utterance
plan that allows to construct a preverbal message
that contains this information. The top element of
the Agenda is passed on to the Formulation & Ar-
ticulation component as soon as that component has
finished uttering the previous element.
In the current implementation of the GVA, utter-
ance plans are stored as lists of potential messages
and construction rules. For example, with a track-
MEP, associated knowledge is stored that the object
shall first be identified (by either stating the name
associated to that object, e.g., ?Dorfstra?e? or choos-
ing a referring expression that allows for definite
identification). Then, if available, information about
geometric relations such as parallelism with other
linear objects on the map is selected from the VETM
knowledge base, followed by information about spa-
tial relations with other map objects. Subsequently,
the construction of a preverbal message that informs
the user about the extent of the track in the haptic
focus is tried, followed by information about cross-
ings the track has. For each of these construction
rules is tested whether the VETM knowledge base
contains suitable information. If it does, a preverbal
message is generated and added to the Agenda unless
the MKR component rejects the message because
this utterance is inappropriate given the exploration
and verbalization history, which prevents unneces-
sary repetitions of information. For example, if the
user has previously explored the track pt5 and already
received the information that the buildings ?Lidl? and
?Aldi? (cf. Figure 3) are above the track a short time
before, the articulation of this information is pre-
60

vented and the user is given other information (or
none, if no more suitable information is available).
4.3 Formulation and Articulation
In the prototype system presented, formulation is
implemented in a template-based approach (Reiter
& Dale, 2000). The Formulation component uses
a set of sentence templates which consist of partial
lexicalizations and gaps to fill with information for
the exploration situations. Additionally, a lexicon
stores knowledge about natural language expressions
that can be used to express spatial situations. Fig-
ure 5 shows a simple template used for the genera-
tion of identification messages.5 Of the four utter-
ance parts depicted in the left box, one is chosen
randomly enabling some variation in the utterances.
If the MKR component has marked the preverbal
message as a repetition of a previously articulated
utterance, a marker word is placed in the sentence
(here: ?again?). Then, the sentence is completed by
either selecting the name of the object in focus from
the VETM knowledge base or by selecting a referring
expression. The former results in utterances such as
?This is Dorfstra?e?. This text is then synthesized
using text-to-speech (TTS) software.
5 A Worked Example
As described, the development of the component that
conceptualizes the user?s movement is not yet fin-
ished. Therefore, to show the function of the imple-
mentation, we used example inputs that were derived
by manually annotating screen-records from experi-
mental data that was previously collected in Wizard-
of-Oz-like experiments with blindfolded sighted,
blind, and visually impaired people. In these ex-

ing of elements indead leads to grammatically correct German
sentences.
periments, participants received pre-recorded verbal
assisting utterances that were selected by the experi-
menter using a custom-built software tool based on a
visualization of the user?s movement on a computer
screen (Lohmann & Habel, forthcoming, and Sec-
tion 2). Using video records of the visualizations
of the user?s movements, the first author manually
annotated the relevant MEPs and their specifications
that, in the VAVETaM structure, the MEP Observer
component should output. These manually annotated
MEPs form the input to test the prototype system.6
In order to exemplify the function of the gener-
ation system, a small part of one of the annotated
inputs is detailed in this section.7 Figure 6 visual-
izes a part of the movement of a visually impaired
map explorer and the corresponding names and iden-
tifiers of the objects used for the specification of the
MEPs in the VETM knowledge base. As the figure
shows, the map explorer touches the track pt3, com-
ing from the left. The track is explored for a while
with small movements. (This position is remained
for a relatively long time, maybe listening to the on-
going utterances.) Then, the map explorer proceeds
to the bottom end of the track before following the
track upwards. Figure 6 shows that the bottom end of
the track is conceptualized as distinct track segment,
track segment pts33, which is part of the track pt3.

dicate which information has been selected from the
VETM knowledge base, which preverbal messages
(PVMs) are put onto the Agenda, and how utterances
are articulated. Based on the log files, we detail the
processes performed by the GVA component and the
resulting verbal output in Table 3.
During the user?s long first exploration movement
of the track pt3 from seconds 33 to 54, which is con-
ceptualized by trackMEP(pt3), the GVA component
expresses all the information that is associated with
the track pt3 in the VETM. The first message informs
the user about the identity of the track by stating the
identifying utterance ?This is Amselweg?. Then, the
user is informed about geometric relations of this
track to other tracks. In the present case, information
about parallelism with the track pt4 is available in the
VETM and a corresponding utterance is produced.
Subsequently, the user is informed about the extent
of the track, i.e., where it ends. Then, information
about the intersections the track has is uttered. These
are all assisting utterances that are possible given the
current MEP and the knowledge base.8
Next, the user moves downwards resulting in the
distinct track segment pts33 coming into secondary
focus. All PVMs about the object in primary focus
(pt3) are blocked by the MKR component, as they
have just been uttered. Thus, a message that informs
the user about his or her position on the track segment
is formulated, resulting in a message such as ?Here,
Amselweg is restricted by the map frame?. When the
user leaves the track segment pt33, no further assist-
ing utterances are given as all information associated
with the track pt3 has been expressed recently.
8Note that the order in which information is given is fixed
in the current system as explained in Subsection 4.2. Whether
giving the messages in another order, which is potentially more
flexible, is more helpful, has to be further evaluated.

6 Conclusion
We presented a prototype system that generates situ-
ated assisting utterances for tactile-map explorations
to ease tactile map learning. The prototype is based
on an earlier concept. We focussed on the GVA
component in the system, which solves the ?What
to say?? task of natural language generation, taking
into account the situated context. We exemplified
the working of the component in a testing environ-
ment based on a conceptualization of a part of a
real tactile-map exploration, for which it generates
plausible and timely output that is comparable to
assisting utterances that were in previous research
tested in Wizard-of-Oz-like experiments with blind-
folded sighted people and in ongoing experiments
with blind and visually impaired people. Therefore,
we conclude that a generation system working in the
manner described is technically possible. We also
explained in detail the structure and implementation
of MEPs, which are the basis for categorization of the
user?s movements and, with additional specification,
the input to the GVA component.
More fine-grained analysis is needed to gain
knowledge (1) about how much information should
be given via the verbal channel to maximize effi-
ciency, and (2) whether the system can be improved
by using more flexible Utterance Plans.
7 Discussion and Outlook
One problem which became apparent in the experi-
ments and also in preliminary tests of the fully inte-
grated prototype system is the fact that the user?s ex-
ploration movements on the map may be very quick.
In these cases, the information to be delivered may
already be outdated when the assistive utterance con-
veys this information. This is partly due to the Ger-
man word order, as can be seen in Figure 5, which
shows the template for identification messages.
Problems can occur in cases where an utterance
is verbalized shortly before the user starts exploring
another map object. In this case, the exploration situ-
ation changes during articulation. Currently, the com-
ponents concerned with language generation work in
a modularized sequential manner without feedback.
If an utterance was sent to formulation, it cannot not
be changed anymore. Hence, it can happen that as-
sisting utterances and the user?s exploration are not
in all cases timely.
One possible remedy to this problem is to extend
the formulation to work in an incremental fashion
such that it explicitly handles situations in which a
currently articulated utterance is outdated (e.g., an
identification utterance that is no longer valid because
the object to be identified has gone out of focus) and
by altering it to a new utterance of similar structure
(i.e., an identification utterance for a different ob-
ject which just came into the haptic focus). In this
case, it could adapt the ongoing utterance (if it is
still in an early stage of production) to replace the
previous identifying word (e.g., ?Amselweg?) with
the new word (i.e., ?Dorfstra?e?). Of course, this is
only possible if the articulation (text-to-speech syn-
