Abstract 
Sharing portions of grammars across languages greatly re- 
duces the costs of nutltilingual grammar engineering. Related 
languages hare a ntuch wider range of linguistic itff'ornuttio;t 
than typically assunwd in stamlard mttltilingttal gramtmtr 
atwhitectures. Taking grammatical relatedness eriously, we 
are particularly interested in designing lhtguistically motivated 
grammatical resottrces Jbr Slavic languages to be used itz 
applied and theoretical computational linguistics, ht order to 
gain the pelwpective of a language-family oriented gramntar 
desigtl, we consider {ttt arrtly of systematic relations that can 
hold between syntactical units. While the categorisation of 
primitive linguistic entities tends to be language-specilic or 
even constrttction-.~pecific, the relations holding between them 
allow viii'lofts degrees of absltztction. On the basis of Slavic 
&tta, we show how a domain ontology conceptualising molpho- 
syntaclic "buildiltg blocks" can serve as a basis r~" a shared 
grotlt;nar of Slavic. 
Introduction 
In applied computational linguistics, the need for 
developing and utilising operational notions of 
shared grammars tems fi'om multilingual grammar 
engineering. If considerable portions of existing 
grammars can be reused for the specification ot7 new 
grammars, development eftbrts can be greatly re- 
duced. A shared grammar also facilitates the diffi- 
cult task of lnaintaining consistency within and 
across the individual parallel grammars. In machine 
translation, the specification of a shared grammar 
can furthermore be exploited for simplifying the 
transfer process. 
Without much ado, computational linguists engaged 
in multilingual grammar development have always 
tried to reduce their labour by importing existing 
grammar components in a simple "copy-paste- 
modify" fashion. But there were also a number of 
systematic attempts to create and describe shared 
grammars that are convincingly documented in 
publications. \[Kam88\] demonstrates the concept for 
a relatively restricted domain, the grammatical 
description of simple nominal expressions in five 
languages. \[BOP88\] were able to exploit the gram- 
matical overlap of two Slavic languages, for the 
design of a lean transfer process in Russian to 
Czech machine translation. In multilingual applica- 
tion development within Microsoft research, gram- 
mar sharing has extensively been exploited - 
\[Pin96\], \[GLPR97\]. 
However, all these approaches are rather opportun- 
istic in the sense that existing grammatical descrip- 
tions based on existing grammar models were ex- 
plored. We went a step further and started grammar 
design with a notion of a shared grammar for a 
family of related languages. Pursuing the goal of 
designing linguistically motivated grammatical 
resources for Slavic languages to be used in com- 
putational linguistics, one is inevitably confronted 
with primary problems temming ti'om the t'act that 
different linguistic theories cut up grammars in 
quite different ways, and grammar formalisms differ 
in their degree of granularity. It cannot be expected, 
therefore, that the minimal differences between two 
languages or their shared elements form easily 
identifiable units in the available language-specific 
grammars. Therefore, an ontology conceptualising 
morphosyntactic "building blocks" would offer a 
solid basis for a shared grammar of Slavic in the 
sense of \[ASU99\]. Our use of the term ontology is 
fairly pragmatic, namely, as representing a formal 
shared conceptualisation f a particular domain of 
interest. It describes concepts relevant for the do- 
main, their relationships, as well as "axioms" about 
these concepts and relationships. Note that such a 
pragmatic approach does not presuppose any gen- 
eral all-encompassing ontology of language but 
rather "mini-ontologies" conceptualising the se- 
lected domain from various perspectives in a con- 
sistent way. The domain of interest in this project is 
the grammatical knowledge on Slavic morphosyn- 
tax contained in linguistic theories and linguistic 
descriptions. While the categorisation of primitive 
linguistic entities lends to be language-specific or
even construction-specific, the relations holding 
between them allow various degrees of abstraction. 
In order to gain the perspective of language-family 
oriented grammar design, we will consider the array 
of .s3,stematic relations that can hold between syn- 
tactically significant items. 
Systematic relations 
Systematic relations motivate shared patterns of 
variation cross-linguistically as well as across con- 
structions. In a constraint-based theory like HPSG, 
where the grammatical properties of linguistic enti- 
ties are typically revealed in complex taxonomies, 
nothing in the formal apparatus would actually 
exclude the possibility to organise also the relations 
holding in syntactic onstructions in a type hierar- 
chy. So, the type subsumption could be interpreted 
as modelling a continuum from general - and pre- 
sumably universal - systematic relations to more 
and still more specific instances of these relations 
resulting fi'om admissible cross-classifications. I In
I The two types of edges connecting types in otu g,'aphical 
representation f hierarchies - 'square' and 'direct' - are signifi- 
cant. The former indicate possible conjunction of types, and thus 
introduce various dimensions of multiple inhe,'itance. The latter 
indicate disjunction of types within the respective dimension of 
classification.

our view, two orthogonal types of systematic rela- 
tions have to be distinguished: syntagmatics and 
alignment, since they appear to be universally rele- 
vant for the well-for|nedlmss of utterances in any 
language (Hierarchy I). 2 Syntagmatic relations play 
a constitutive role in syntax by establishing instant 
COlmections between linguistic entities in various 
constructions. There is a covert, meaningful dime,> 
sion of structural syntagmatics, a +d a , l  ()Vel"t.,  , l lO l " -

With respect to the alignment relation, which is 
responsible for the actual lincat distributiot+ of syn- 
tactically relevant itch|s, we assun|e that at least the 
continuity o1' syntactic units, the directionality of

cally significant entity) its well as the l)eril)hery of at

The continuity of syntactic units can be realised its 
immediate constituency (i.e. of type continuous) or 
as long-distance constituency (i.e. o1' type discon- 
tinue++s). The directionality accounts for situations 
where, e.g., Ihe head either li)llows the dependent or 
precedes it. In turn, the i~eriphcry of a syntactically 
determined omain can be left or right. 
St ructura l  syntagmat ics  
The structural syutagn|atic relations between two 
syntactic units is classified along two primary di- 
mensions which we call centHcity and taxis 
(Hierarchy 3). The chosen terms should be under- 
{~ tr stood in the context of distin .uishin~, on the one 
hand, endocentric imd exocentric relations, and on 
the other hand, h37mtaxix and parataxis. The endo- 
centricity of a strt,ctural syntagmatic relation 
(between, e.g., ~ and \[~) presuptmses that one of the 
syntactic items involved in this relation (e.g., c0 
plays a pron|inent role. In contrast, the exocenlricity 
of a structural syntag,natic relation presupl)oses no 
assun+|ptions in this respect, hence, it can be viewed 
as the unmarked member of the centricity opposi- 
tion. The hypotaxis means that there is a depend-

Consequently, if two linguistic entities belong to- 
gether fi'om the viewpoint of structural syntagtnat- 
its, they are involved in one of the following rela- 
tion types which arc obtained via+ admissible cross- 
classifications (Hierarchy 4). 
l,;ndocc||tric hypotaxis, or selection. The head- 
dependent co|fl'igu|'ation can be identified unambi- 
guously. Tim prominent element is also the domi- 
nating one in the subordination. 
Exoccntric hypotaxis, or modification. There is no

role of a dolninating item in the subordination. Note 
that this is where (theory-sinusitis) linguistic con- 
ventions regarding the head-dependct+t configura- 
tion actually begin. 
Endocentric parataxis. There is a prominent elc- 
|nent in this relation, but no head-dependent con- 
figuration. 
Exocentric parataxis. In the relation holding be- 
tween lhc ilwolved linguistic entities there is neither 
a prominent element nor a head-dependent configu- 
ration. This is the tmlnarked case with respect to 
both ccnlricity and taxis.

Due to the fact that there always is a principal or 
leading element in tile endocenlric relations, differ- 
ent linguistic theories typically agree on how to 
intel'pret these relations tructurally. But there is no 
consensus -- often even within the same linguistic 
theory - on the structural interpretation of the 
exocentric relations. So, additional factors are usu- 
ally taken into consideration as st, pporting the in- 
+,'eduction of particular conventions. The latter, 
however, arc not always linguistically motiwtted, 
29 
tile choice is sometimes arbitrary and often due to 
theory-sl~ecific technical reasons. 
Combinator ia l  syntagmat ics  
The combinatorial dimension in tile proposed tax- 
onomy (Hierarchy 5) largely corresponds, in our 
understanding, to what \[S&L95\] regard as mor- 
phological signalling of direct syntactic relations.

Hicrm'chy  5: Combinator ia l  synt~mat ics  
Tile combinatorial syntagmatic relation of juxtapo- 
sition presupposes no overt morphological indica- 
tion. As to governmettt, i  is traditionally under- 
stood as the determination by one element of the 
inflectional form of the other, i.e. form government. 
Its classical instance is, of course, case government. 
In \[Cann93\] (p. 51) these morpllosyntactic relation 
is formulated for some construction involving y and 
(5 ill tile following way: y governs (5 if (i) varying the 
inflectional l'orm of (5 while keeping T constant leads 
to ungrammaticality, and (ii) varying the form o f t  
and keeping 8 constant makes no difference to 
grammaticality. The systematic co-variatioll o1' 
linguistic forms is typically rcalised as feature con- 
gruity, i.e. compatibility of values of identical 
grammatical categories of syntactically colnbined 
linguistic items. Ill our view, two general co- 
variation types must be distinguished (cf. Hierarchy 
6), namely, asymmetric and symmetric co-variation, 
with only the former actually corresponding to the 
traditional directional concept of agreement, e.g., 
\[Cor98\].

llierarchy 6: Morphosyntaclic co-variation 
As the term suggests, the asymmetry of co-variation 
presupposes a controller-target conl'iguration. This 
is to be contrasted with the synunetry of co- 
variation which is not interpretable in these terms. 
Symmetric o-variation, in essence, would presume 
redundancy as if both co-varying syntactic items 
were controllers and targets at the same time. 
Endocentric hypotaxis (selection) 
The endocentric hypotaxis corresponds to the tradi- 
tional notion of selection. Even though not directly 
observable, it underlies specific morphosyntactic 
realities interpreted in Hierarchy 7 as resulting from 
a cross-classification with the combinatorial syn- 
tagmatic relation types. 
The traditional notion of subcategorisation call thus 
be viewed as a selection that is realised via govern- 
mont. Two general oplions are usually available 
across languages lbr externalising the governed 
selection (i.e. subcategorisation) of nominal catego- 
ries in actual syntactic onstructions.

Hierarchy 7: Selection 
A typical definition of Ihe firsl one call be found in 
\[Blake94\]: "Case in its most een|ral manifestation is
a system of marking dependent nouns for the type 
of relationship they bear to their beads". The rela- 
tional case explicating case government stands in 
opposition to tile so-called concordial case ob- 
served in ease-governed modification environments 
and presented in Hierarchy 8. The second option to 
externalise subcatcgorisation f nominal categories 
is the cross-referencing the syntactic function of the 
dependent at the head. It is actually confined to 
certain core grammatical relations and typically 
amounts to some kind of pronominal representation 
of these grammatical relations at tile head. As 
\[Blake94\] observes, the cross-referencing pronomi- 
nal elements erve as an alternative to case ill sig- 
nalling grammatical relations. In Slavic, there are 
two candidales for the second /ype of externalising 
a governed selection. On tile ()he hand, lh0 verb 
inl\]cction can possibly be interpreted as cross- 
referencing the sub.icct fnnetion, especially in Bul- 
garian where no relational case is realised on the 
dependent. On the other band, pronominal elitics 
can cross-reference the direct and the indirect object 
in Bulgarian verb complex, cf. \[Avg97a\], as well as 
the possessor relation in Bulgarian noun phrases, cf. 
\[Avg97b\]. Therefore, the systematic relation of 
object cliticisation can be viewed as a more specific 
instance of cross-referencing. In general, a nominal 
category representing a grammatical relation that is 
cross-referenced at the head selecting this nominal 
category need not be overtly realised. So, the cross- 
referenced noun phrase controlling the agreement 
can typically be omitted. 
In our view, the systematic relation of marking 
(Hierarchy 7) is an instance of juxtaposed selection, 
i.e. all endocentrie hypotaxis that is realised via 
juxtaposition. We promote a faMy extensive under- 
standing of this syntactic relation as involving vari- 
ous functional categories, including auxiliaries, 
particles, determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, 
etc. The notion of morphosyntactic marking is in- 
troduced in \[Avg97a\] for syntagmatic relations

its subject or conlplcmcnt is interpreted in our tax- 
onotny as a selection real\]seal via asymmetric o- 
variation (agreement 1). It typically occurs in con\]- 
bination with the relation of subcatcgorisation (of. 
Table 1) which in languages mnploying relational 
case is realiscd as case assignment, while it\] those

Finally, what we call matching corresponds to a 
selection rcaliscd via symmetric co-variation. Its 
most typical instance can be found where there is 
compatibility in person, number or gender between 
(possibly multiple) auxiliaries and a main verb. 
Matching usually co-occut's with a 1nat+king rchition 
(cf. Table 2) which, as shown in Hierarchy 7, is 
interpreted its a juxlaposcd selection. 
Exocent r i c  hypotax is  (modi f icat ion)  
The exoccntric hypotaxis corresponds to the mtdi- 
tional notion of modification. It nnderlies specific 
morphosyntactic realities resulling from a cross- 
classification with combinatorial syntagmalic rela- 
tion types (cf. Hierarchy 8). In all of then\], we are 
confronted with a +'elation of subordination in 
which, however, there is no indisputable prominent 
clcmenL 
It+ general we assume that there is no "case agree- 
ment". Rather, the regular compatibility of case 
specifications between the itwolved syntaclic items 
is due to a modification relation realised in a gov-  
erned environment. Ix+ other words, we cat\] regard 
concordial case as a typical instance of a governed 
modification. The asymmetric co-variation real\]sing 
a modification relation can be called concord, but 
let us refer to it - for the sake of sitnplicity - as 
ctgreement 2. In the majority of Slavic languages, 
but obviously not in Bulgarian, this relation occurs 
in combination with concordial case (of. Table 3). 
Note that in our approach the treat+nun+ of nominal 
apposition would be parallel to that of the adjective- 
noun relations.

The main difference between tl~e agt'eement 1
(Hierarchy 7) and the agreement 2 (or concord) 
discussed here amounts to tile fact that these co- 
variation relations exhibit different ccntricity. 
Cross-classifying cxoccntric hypotaxis with sym- 
metric co-vat\]alien results in what cat+ be called 
simile and is typically observed in comparative 
31 
constructions, provided appropriate categories are 
available. This systematic relation differs fl'om that 
of parallelism (distinguished in Hierarehy 10) in 
being hypotactic in nature, and thus, an actual in- 
stance of modification. Similarly to the asymmetric 
agreement 2 (concord), tim simile relation co-occurs 
with concordial case, cf. ex. 6. The systematic rela- 
tion of (case) adjunction is an instance of juxta- 
I)osed mod(fication.

Interestingly, the well-known "instrumental" prob- 
lem - i.e. whether we are confi'onted with a com- 
plement or a free adjt, nc t -  narrows down in our 
approach to a fluctuation between adjunction 
(juxtaposed modification - Hierarchy 8) and sub- 
categorisation (governed selection - Hierarchy 7), 
with the crucial point being merely a different ccn- 
tricity interpretation. Also the secondaly predica- 
tion (referring, typically, to the relation holding 
between a verb and a secondary controlled predica- 
tive) is a subtype of juxtaposed modification, with 
the predicative case adjunction as a more specific 
instance. As to the relation holding between the 
secondary predicative and the subject or the object, 
it is an instance o1' control and presupposes co- 
reference. The latter two concepts realise an endo- 
ccntric parataxis and are introduced in Hierarchy 9. 
Endocentric parataxis 
In the endoccntric parataxis there is a prominent 
item but no subordination relation. This allows us to 
model concepts like co-reference, correlation, co- 
marking (illustrated by ex. 6) and control as natu- 
rally resulting from a cross-classification with the 
combinatorial syntagmatic relation types. 
If an endocentric parataxis is revealed by an asym- 
metric co-variation, this results in co-reference. This 
systematic relation is tbund in relativisation (i.e. 
between a nominal category and the relative pro- 
noun introducing a relative clause that modifies this 
nominal category), in resumption (i.e. between a 
nominal category and the pronominal element re- 
suming it in a different syntactic domain), and in 
binding (i.e. between a pronoun and its antecedent). 
When, however, an endocentric parataxis is re- 
vealed in a symmetric o-variation, we can speak of 
correlation. But in both instances of co-variation, 
we arc confronted with paMng indices (or restricted 
parameters) el' referential objects. What we propose 
to distinguish as co-marking corresponds to endo- 
centrie parataxis that is realised via juxtaposition. 
So, it contrasts with the systematic relation of 
marking (presented in Hierarchy 7) only along the 
taxis dimension of structural syntagmatics inasmuch 
as there is no subordination relation between the 
involved syntactic items. As to the systematic rela- 
tion of syntactic ontrol, it is registered in our tax- 
enemy as an cndocentrie parataxis resulting in a 
for,n government. In Bulgarian, it co-occurs with 
co-reference - cx. 3 and ex. 4.

Hierarchy I0: Exocenlrie paralaxis 
The relation of co-dependence plays a crucial role 
in a number of constructions. It is an exoeentric 
parataxis that is realised via government, with a 
special requirement that all involved syntactic items 
have the same governor. In other words, these items 
are typically dependcnts of the same syntactic head. 
What we call agreement 3 (or accord) corresponds 
to an exocentric paralaxis that is rcaliscd via asym- 
metric co-variation. It regularly presupposes a co- 
32 
dependence relation (of. Table 4), and its most 
typical instance can be fotmd as a COlnpatibility in 
number or gender between the subject and the 
predicative in copular constructions. Another in- 
stance is lhe co-dependence relation holding be- 
lween a dependent of the primary predicate (i.e. the 
verb) and a secondary predicative in ex. 1 and cx. 2. 
When exocentric parataxis is externalised by a 
symmetric co-variation, we are confronted with 
parallelism. It co-occurs in ex. 5 with co- 
dependence. 
The coordinatioll relation is generally interprelable 
as an exocemric paratactic juxtaposition.

Conclusion and prospects  
We have p,esented an approach of computational 
grammar design tlmt st, pports the notion of gram- 
mar sharing and, moreover, lends itself to the for- 
real linguistic description of individual anguages as 
well as language families. The basic building blocks

accommodating HPSG. Some of these systems have 
reached a parsing efficiency thai makes them suited 
for a wu'iety of applications, \]F()TU2000\[. Al- 
though the original motiwltion for the work calllO 
from applied research, the insights thai were gained 
on the differences between Slavic languages, led lo 
new results in comparative linguistic dcscrip/ion. 
We expecl that psycholinguistic research on bilin- 
gt, alism and second language acquisition will 
greatly benefit from opportunities of modelling 
shared grammatical knowledge. The insights gained 
by such models will in turn be useful for CALL 
applications and for the computational treatment of 
cross - language interference in gl'ananlar and style 
checking.
