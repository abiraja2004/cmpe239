Abstract 
In a multimodal conversation, user refer-
ring patterns could be complex, involving 
multiple referring expressions from 
speech utterances and multiple gestures. 
To resolve those references, multimodal 
integration based on semantic constraints 
is insufficient. In this paper, we describe a 
graph-based probabilistic approach that 
simultaneously combines both semantic 
and temporal constraints to achieve a high 
performance.

Introduction 
Multimodal conversation systems allow users to 
converse with systems through multiple modalities 
such as speech, gesture and gaze (Cohen et al, 
1996; Wahlster, 1998).  In such an environment, 
not only are more interaction modalities available, 
but also richer contexts are established during the 
interaction. Understanding user inputs, for 
example, what users refer to is important. Previous 
work on multimodal reference resolution includes 
the use of a focus space model (Neal et al, 1998), 
the centering framework (Zancanaro et al, 1997), 
context factors (Huls et al, 1995), and rules 
(Kehler 2000). These previous approaches focus 
on semantics constraints without fully addressing 
temporal constraints. In a user study1, we found 
that the majority of user referring behavior 
involved one referring expression and one gesture 
(as in [S2, G2] in Table 1). The earlier approaches 
worked well for these types of references. 
However, we found that 14.1% of the inputs were 
complex, which involved multiple referring 
expressions from speech utterances and multiple 
gestures (S3 in Table 1). To resolve those complex 
references, we have to not only apply semantic 
constraints, but also apply temporal constraints at 
the same time.  
For example, Figure 1 shows three inputs where 
the number of referring expressions is the same 
and the number of gestures is the same. The speech 
utterances and gestures are aligned along the time 
axis. The first case (Figure 1a) and the second case 
(Figure 1b) have the same speech utterance but 
different temporal alignment between the gestures 
and the speech input. The second case and the third 
case (Figure 1c) have a similar alignment, but the 
third case provides an additional constraint on the 
number of referents (from the word ?two?).  
Although all three cases are similar, but the 
objects they refer to are quite different in each 
case. In the first case, most likely ?this? refers to 
the house selected by the first point gesture and 
?these houses? refers to two houses selected by the 
other two gestures. In the second case, ?this? most 
likely refers to the highlighted house on the display 
and ?these houses? refer to three houses selected 
by the gestures. In the third case, ?this? most likely 
refers to the house selected by the first point 
gesture and ?these two houses? refers to two 
houses selected by the other two point gestures.

Resolving these complex cases requires 
simultaneously satisfying semantic constraints 
from inputs and the interaction contexts, and the 
temporal constraints between speech and gesture.     
2 Graph-based Approach 
We use a probabilistic approach based on attrib-
uted relational graphs (ARGs) to combine semantic 
and temporal constraints for reference resolution. 
First, ARGs can adequately capture the semantic 
and temporal information (for both referring ex-
pressions and potential referents). Second, the 
graph match mechanism allows a simultaneous 
application of temporal constraints and semantic 
constraints. Specifically, we use two attributed re-
lational graphs (ARGs). One graph corresponds to 
all referring expressions in the speech utterances, 
called the referring graph. The other graph corre-
sponds to all potential referents (either coming 
from gestures or contexts), called the referent 
graph. By finding the best match between the re-
ferring graph and the referent graph, we can find 
the most possible referent(s) to each referring ex-
pression.  
An ARG consists of a set of nodes and a set of 
edges. For example, Figure 2(a) is the referring 
graph for the speech utterance in Figure 1(c). 
There are two nodes corresponding to two refer-
ring expressions ?this? and ?these two houses? re-
spectively. Each node encodes the semantic and 
temporal information of the corresponding refer-
ring expression such as the semantic type of the 
potential referent, the number, the start and end 
time the expression was uttered, etc.  The edge be-
tween two nodes indicates the semantic and tempo-
ral relations between these two expressions. 
Similarly, Figure 2(b) is the referent graph for the 
input in Figure 1(c). This referent graph consists of 
four sub-graphs.  Three sub-graphs correspond to 
three gestures respectively. Each node in these sub-
graphs corresponds to one object selected by the 
gesture. Each node encodes the semantic and tem-
poral information of the selected object, as well as 
the probability this object is actually selected. 
There is also a sub-graph corresponding to the in-
teraction context.  Each node in this sub-graph 
represents an object in the focus in the last interac-
tion turn. The sub-graphs are connected via seman-
tic type and temporal relations.  
With the ARG representations described above, 
the reference resolution problem becomes match-
ing the referent graph with the referring graph. 
Suppose we have two graphs to be matched:  
? The referent graph Gc = ?{ax}, {rxy}?, where {ax} 
is the node list and {rxy} is the edge list. The 
edge rxy connects nodes ax and ay.

with respect to P(ax,?m), the matching probabili-
ties between the referent node ax and the referring 
node ?m. 
The function Q(Gc,Gs) measures the degree of 
the overall match between the referent graph and 
the referring graph. This function not only consid-
ers the similarities between nodes as indicated by 
the function ?(ax,?m), but also considers the simi-
larities between edges as indicated by the function 
?(rxy,?mn). Both node similarity and edge similarity 
functions are further defined by a combination of 
semantic and temporal constraints. For example, 
?(ax,?m)=Sem(ax,?m)Tem(ax,?m), where Sem(ax,?m)  
measures the semantic compatibility by determin-
ing whether the semantic categories of ax and ?m 
are the same, whether their attributes are compati-
ble, and so on.  Tem(ax,?m) measures the temporal 
alignment and is empirically defined as follows:

To maximize (1), we modified the graduated as-
signment algorithm (Gold and Rangarajan, 1996). 
When the algorithm converges, P(ax,?m) gives us 
the matching probabilities. Details are described in 
a separate paper.   
3 Discussion 
During the study, we collected 156 inputs. The 
system assigned time stamps to each recognized 
word in the utterance, and each gesture.  Figure 3 
shows an example of an input that consisted of two 
gesture inputs and a speech utterance ?compare 
this house with this house?. The first two lines rep-
resent two gestures. Each line gives information 
about when the gesture started and ended, as well 
as the selected objects with their probabilities. 
These data provided us information on how the 
speech and gesture were aligned (to the accuracy 
of milliseconds). These data will help us further 
validate the temporal compatibility function used 
in the matching process.  
We described an approach that uses graph 
matching algorithm to combine semantic and tem-
poral constraints for reference resolution. The 
study showed that this approach worked quite well 
(93% accuracy) when the referring expressions 
were correctly recognized by the ASR. In the fu-
ture, we plan to incorporate spatial constraints.
