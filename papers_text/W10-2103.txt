Abstract
This paper summarizes some of the appli-
cations of NLP techniques in various lin-
guistic sub-fields, and presents a few ex-
amples that call for a deeper engagement
between the two fields.
1 Introduction
The recent success of data-driven approaches in
NLP has raised important questions as to what role
linguistics must now seek to play in further ad-
vancing the field. Perhaps, it is also time to pose
the same question from the other direction: As
to how NLP techniques can help linguists make
informed decisions? And how can the advances
made in one field be applied to the other?
Although, there has been some work on in-
corporating NLP techniques for linguistic field-
work and language documentation (Bird, 2009),
the wider use of NLP in linguistic studies is still
fairly limited. However, it is possible to deepen
the engagement between the two fields in a num-
ber of possible areas (as we shall see in the follow-
ing sections), and gain new insights even during
the formulation of linguistic theories and frame-
works.
2 Historical Linguistics and Linguistic
Typology
Computational techniques have been successfully
used to classify languages and to generate phylo-
genetic trees. This has been tried not just with
handcrafted word lists (Atkinson et al, 2005;
Atkinson and Gray, 2006; Huelsenbeck et al,
2001) or syntactic data (Barbac?on et al, 2007) but
with lists extracted from written corpus with com-
parable results (Rama and Singh, 2009; Singh and
Surana, 2007). These techniques are inspired from
the work in computational phylogenetics, which
was aimed at constructing evolutionary trees of
Figure 1: Phylogenetic tree using feature n-grams
biological species. Constructing a phylogenetic
tree for languages usually requires the calcula-
tion of distances between pairs of languages (usu-
ally based on word lists). These distances are
then given as input to a computational phyloge-
netic algorithm. Their successful use for lan-
guages has opened the possibility of using compu-
tational techniques for studying historical linguis-
tics. They have already been used for estimating
divergence times of language families (Atkinson
et al, 2005). Figure 1 shows a phylogenetic tree
created using feature n-grams (Rama and Singh,
2009).
Another area for the application of NLP tech-
niques is language typology. For example, lin-
guistic similarity and its estimation can be seen as
fundamental ideas in NLP. The systematic study
of different kinds of linguistic similarity offers
insights towards the theoretical studies of lan-
guages (Singh, 2010). In brief, the typology of
linguistic similarity for computational purposes
is related to linguistic levels (depth), differences
among languages (linguality) and linguistic units
(granularity). Thus, language can be seen as a
system of symbols whose meanings are defined
18
in terms of their estimated similarity and distance
with other symbols. Can this, together with what
Cognitive Linguists have been studying (Robin-
son and Ellis, 2008), which also involves linguistic
similarity, often directly, have some relevance for
linguists?
3 Lexical Correspondence and Linguistic
Units
A further case in point is lexical correspondence
across languages, which poses a problem for
cross-lingual and multilingual applications. To
address this and some other issues, a linguistic
unit that behaves similarly across languages can
be conceptualized. Such a unit, may include
morphological variation (inflectional and deriva-
tional), compounds, multi word expressions etc.
as in the Hindi and Telugu examples below:
? Single token content words: raama, raama
(Ram); vah, atanu (he); vyakti, manishii (per-
son) etc.
? Nouns with inflections: bacce, pillalu (chil-
dren); bacce ko, pillalaki (to the child);
raama se, raamudunundii (from Rama) etc.
? Verbs with inflections and tense, aspect and
modality (TAM) markers: karnaa-caahiye,
cayiyaalii (should do); ho sakataa thaa,
ayyiyedemo (could have happened) etc.
? Multi word expressions such as idioms,
phrasal verbs and ?frozen expressions?: pa-
haaD toDanaa (breaking mountains); muNha
ki khaana (getting defeated) etc.
? Compounds: jaati-prathaa (caste system);
vesh-bhuushaaoN (dresses); akkaDaa-
ikkaDaa (here and there) etc.
This unit might, among other things, form the
basis of the structure of lexical resources, such
that these resources have a direct correspondence
across languages. This can further facilitate com-
parative study of languages (Singh, 2010).
4 Applications
Computational techniques can also be used to de-
sign tools and material for language learning and
teaching. Here games can play a useful role. Al-
though, a large number of online games are avail-
able, most of them do not use the latest language
processing techniques. Games can also be used to
generate language resources.
The core idea in Human Computa-
tion (Von Ahn, 2005) is that computers should
do what they do best and that humans seamlessly
work with them to do what computers cannot.
One of the ways to merge the two is in the form of
carefully designed games.
Another insight comes from Machine Transla-
tion. More than any other sub-field in NLP, it is
the data-driven approaches to machine translation
that have proven to be particularly successful over
the past few years. We have been exploring vari-
ous approaches towards hybridization of our rule-
based MT system. Building the transfer-grammar
of such systems is perhaps one of the most time-
intensive tasks that involves careful analysis of test
data. However, data driven techniques can come
to the aid of linguists in this case. The recent
work on automatic acquisition of rules from par-
allel corpora (Lavie et al, 2004) can help iden-
tify a large number of common syntactic transfor-
mations across a pair of languages, and help un-
earth those transformations that might otherwise
be missed by a rule-based grammar. They can be
further used to prioritize the application of rules
based on the observed frequencies of certain syn-
tactic transformations.
5 NLP Tools and Linguistics
NLP techniques draw features from annotated cor-
pora which are a rich linguistic resource. How-
ever, these corpora can also be used to extract
grammars, which on one hand feed the parser
with features (Xia, 2001), and on the other, act
as a resource for linguistic studies. For exam-
ple, in Hindi dependency parsing the use of vib-
hakti (post-positions) and TAM labels has proven
to be particularly useful even in the absence of
large amounts of annotated corpora (Ambati et al,
2010). This also helped bring to light those fea-
tures of the grammar that govern certain struc-
ture choices and brought to notice some previously
overlooked linguistic constructions. Thus, the re-
sult is an iterative process, where both the gram-
mar and the features are refined.
Discourse Processing is another rapidly emerg-
ing research area with considerable potential for
interaction and collaboration between NLP and
Linguistics. In the absence of fully developed the-
ories/frameworks on both sides, focus on syner-
19
gizing research efforts in the two disciplines (such
as devising novel ways to empirically test linguis-
tic hypotheses) from the initial stage itself, can
yield a substantially richer account of Discourse.
Linguistic theories are formalized based on ob-
servations and abstractions of existing linguistic
facts. These theories are then applied to vari-
ous languages to test their validity. However, lan-
guages throw up new problems and issues before
theoreticians. Hence, there are always certain phe-
nomena in languages which remain a point of dis-
cussion since satisfactory solutions are not avail-
able. The facts of a language are accounted for
by applying various techniques and methods that
are offered by a linguistic framework. For exam-
ple, syntactic diagnostics have been a fairly re-
liable method of identifying/classifying construc-
tion types in languages. They work fairly well for
most cases. But in some cases even these tests fail
to classify certain elements. For example, Indian
languages show a highly productive use of com-
plex predicates (Butt, 1995; Butt, 2003). How-
ever, till date there are no satisfactory methods to
decide when a noun verb sequence is a ?complex
predicate? and when a ?verb argument? case. To
quote an example from our experience while de-
veloping a Hindi Tree Bank, annotators had to be
provided with guidelines to mark a N V sequence
as a complex predicate based on some linguistic
tests. However, there are instances when the na-
tive speaker/annotator is quite confident of a con-
struction being a complex predicate, even though
most syntactic tests might not apply to it.
Although, various theories provide frames to
classify linguistic patterns/items but none of them
enables us to (at least to my knowledge) handle
?transient/graded? or rather ?evolving? elements.
So, as of now it looks like quite an arbitrary/ad-
hoc approach whether to classify something as a
complex predicate or not. In the above cited ex-
ample, the decision is left to the annotator?s in-
tuition, since linguists don?t agree on the classfi-
cation of these elements or on a set of uniform
tests either. Can the insights gained from inter-
annotator agreement further help theory refine the
diagnostics used in these cases? And can NLP
techniques or advanced NLP tools come to the aid
of linguists here? Perhaps in the form of tools that
can (to an extent) help automate the application of
syntactic diagnostics over large corpora?
6 Collaborations
Interdisciplinary areas such as Computational
Linguistics/NLP need a much broader collabo-
ration between linguists and computer scientists.
Experts working within their respective fields
tend to be deeply grounded in their approaches
towards particular problems. Also, they tend
to speak different ?languages?. Therefore, it
becomes imperative that efforts be made to
bridge the gaps in communication between the
two disciplines. This problem is all the more
acute in India, since the separation of disciplines
happens at a very early stage. Objectives, goals,
methods and training are so different that starting
a communication line proves to be very difficult.
Thus, it is important for those people who have
synthesised the knowledge of the two disciplines
to a large degree, to take the lead and help
establish the initial communication channels. Our
own experiences while devising common tagsets
for Indian languages, made us realize the need
for both linguistic and computational perspectives
towards such problems. While a linguist?s instinct
is to look for exceptions in the grammar (or any
formalism), a computer scientist tends to look for
rules that can be abstracted away and modeled.
However, at the end, both ways of looking at data
help us make informed decisions.
