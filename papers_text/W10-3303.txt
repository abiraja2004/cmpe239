Abstract 
We are describing the construction 
process of a specialized multilingual 
lexical resource dedicated for the ar-
chive of the Digital Silk Road DSR. The 
DSR project creates digital archives of 
cultural heritage along the historical Silk 
Road; more than 116 of basic references 
on Silk Road have been digitized and 
made available online. These books are 
written in various languages and attract 
people from different linguistic back-
ground, therefore, we are trying to build 
a multilingual repository for the termi-
nology of the DSR to help its users, and 
increase the accessibility of these books. 
The construction of a terminological da-
tabase using a classical approach is dif-
ficult and expensive. Instead, we are in-
troducing specialized lexical resources 
that can be constructed by the commu-
nity and its resources; we call it Multi-
lingual Preterminological Graphs 
MPGs.  We build such graphs by ana-
lyzing the access log files of the website 
of the Digital Silk Road. We aim at 
making this graph as a seed repository 
so multilingual volunteers can contrib-
ute.  We have used the access log files 
of the DSR since its beginning in 2003, 
and obtained an initial graph of around 
116,000 terms. As an application, We 
have used this graph to obtain a preter-
minological multilingual database that 
has a number of applications. 
1 Introduction 
This paper describes the design and develop-
ment of a specialized multilingual lexical re-
source for the archive constructed and main-
tained by the Digital Silk Road project. The 
Digital Silk Road project (NII 2003) is an initia-
tive started by the National Institute of Infor-
matics (Tokyo/Japan) in 2002, to archive cul-
tural historical resources along the Silk Road, 
by digitizing them and making them available 
and accessible online.  
One of the most important sub-projects is the 
Digital Archive of Toyo Bunko Rare Books 
(NII 2008) where 116 (30,091 pages) of old rare 
books available at Toyo Bunko library have 
been digitized using OCR (Optical Character 
Recognition) technology. The digitized collec-
tion contains books from nine languages includ-
ing English. The website of the project attracts 
visitors from the domain of history, archeology, 
and people who are interested in cultural heri-
tage. It provides services of reading and search-
ing the books of Toyo Bunko, along with vari-
ety of services. Table 1 shows the countries 
from which DSR is being accessed. The table 
19
shows that around 60% of visitors are coming 
from countries other than Japan. The diversity 
of the visitors? linguistic backgrounds suggests 
two things: 1) Monolingual translation service is 
not enough. 2) It shows that we can benefit from 
allowing them to contribute to a multilingual 
repository. So we design and build a collabora-
tive multilingual terminological database and 
seed using the DSR project and its resources 
(Daoud, Kitamoto et al 2008). However, Dis-
covering and translating domain specific termi-
nology is a very complicated and expensive 
task, because (1) traditionally, it depends on 
human terminologists (Cabre and Sager 1999) 
which increases the cost, (2) terminology is dy-
namic (Kageura 2002), thousands of terms are 
coined each year, and (3) it is difficult to in-
volve domain experts in the construction proc-
ess. That will not only increase the cost, but it 
will reduce the quality, and the coverage (num-
ber of languages and size). Databases like (UN-
Geo 2002; IATE 2008; UN 2008) are built by 
huge organizations, and it is difficult for a 
smaller community to produce its own multilin-
gual terminological database.

In the next section we will give definitions 
for the basic concepts presented in this article, 
in particular, the preterminology and its lexical 
network (graph). Then, in the third section we 
will show the automatic approach to seed the 
multilingual preterminological graph based on 
the resources of the DSR. And then, we will 
discuss the human involvement in the develop-
ment of such a resource by providing a study of 
the possible contributors through analyzing the 
multilinguality and loyalty of the DSR visitors. 
In the fifth section we will show the experimen-
tal results. And finally, we will draw some con-
clusions.   
2 Multilingual Preterminological 
Graphs 
2.1 Preterminology 
Terminological sphere of a domain is the set of 
terms related to that domain. A smaller set of 
that sphere is well documented and available in 
dictionaries and terminological databases such 
as (FAO 2008; IEC 2008; IDRC 2009)... How-
ever, the majority of terms are not multilingual-
ized, nor stored into a database, even though, 
they may be used and translated by the commu-
nity and domain experts. This situation is shown 
in Figure 1, where the majority of terms are in 
area B. Preterminological sphere (area B) of a 
domain is a set of terms (preterms) related to 
the domain and used by the community but it 
might not be documented and included in tradi-
tional lexical databases.

Figure  1. Preterminological sphere 
Every year thousands of terms are coined and 
introduced in correspondence to new concepts, 
scientific discoveries or social needs. Most of 
these terms are produced in the top dominant 
languages, i.e. English. Interested people from 
different linguistic backgrounds would find 
suitable translations to new terms and use it 
amongst them. For example, the term ?status 
update? is used by people who visit social net-
working websites like facebook.com. Transla-
tion of this term to Arabic might not be avail-
able in area A of Figure 1. However the Arabic 
community found a translation that is acceptable 
which is  ????? ??????. So this term is in the area B. 
We are trying to use what is in area A, and what 
can be contributed from B to build preterminol-
ogy (Daoud, Boitet et al 2009).

2.2 Structure of MPG 
We are building preterminological resource as a 
lexical network (graph) to handle the diversity 
of the resources that we use. A multilingual pre-
terminological graph MPG(N,E) is a finite non-
empty set N={n1,n2, ?} of objects called 
Nodes together with a set E={e1,e2, ?} of un-
ordered pairs of distinct nodes of MPG called 
edges. This definition is based on the general 
definition of a graph at the following references 
(Even 1979; Loerch 2000).  MPG of domain X, 
contains possible multilingual terms related to 
that domain connected to each other with rela-
tions. A multilingual lexical unit and its transla-
tions in different languages are represented as 
connected nodes with labels.  
In an MPG the set of nodes N consists of p,l, 
s, occ, where p is the string of the preterm, l is 
the language, s is the code of the first source of 
the preterm, and occ is the number of occur-
rences. Note that l could be undefined. For ex-
ample: N={[silk road, en, log],[Great Wall of China, en, 
,wikipedia, 5], [?????, ar, contributorx,6]}, here we have 
three nodes, 2 of them are English and one in 
Arabic, each term came from a different source. 
Note that English and Arabic terms belong to 
the same N thus, the same MPG. 
An Edge e={n, v} is a pair of nodes adjacent in 
an MPG. An edge represents a relation between 
two preterms represented by their nodes. The 
nature of the relation varies. However, edges are 
weighted with several weights (described be-
low) to indicate the possible nature of this rela-
tion. 
The following are the weights that label the 
edges on an MPG: Relation Weights rw: For an 
edge e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l2,s2]}, rw indicates 
that there is a relation between the preterm p1 
and p2. The nature of the relation could not be 
assumed by rw. Translation Weights tw: For an 
edge e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l2,s2]}, tw suggests that 
p1 in language l1 is a translation of p2 in lan-
guage l2. Synonym Weights sw: For an edge 
e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l1,s2]}, sw suggests that p1 
and p2 are synonyms. 
3 Automatic Initialization of DSR-
MPG  
Basically we seeded DSR-MPG, through two 
steps, the firs one is the automatic seeding, 
which consists of the following: 1) Initialization 
by finding interesting terms used to search the 
website of the DSR. 2) Multilingualization, us-
ing online resources. 3) Graph Expansion using 
the structure of the graph it self. The second 
step is the progressive enhancement, by receiv-
ing contributions from users, through set of use-
ful applications. In this section we will discuss 
the first three steps. In section 4, we will discuss 
the human factor in the development of DSR-
MPG. 
3.1 Analyzing Access Log Files 
We analyze two kinds of access requests that 
can provide us with information to enrich the 
MPG: (1) requests made to the local search en-
gine of DSR (2) requests from web-based 
search engine (like Google, Yahoo!?). These 
requests provide the search terms that visitors 
used to access the website. Moreover, we can 
understand the way users interpret a concept 
into lexical units. For example, if we find that 
five different users send two search requests t1 
and t2, then there is a possibility that t1 and t2 
have a relation. The graph constructor analyzes 
the requests to make the initial graph by creat-
ing edges between terms in the same session. 
rw(x,y), is set to the number of sessions contain-
ing x and y within the log file. 
For example, rw(x,y) = 10 means that 10 
people thought about x and y within the same 
search session. Figure 2 shows an example of a 
produced graph. The method did not discover 
the kind of relation between the terms. But it 
discovered that there is a relation, for example, 
three users requested results for ?yang? fol-
lowed by ?yin? within the same session. Hence, 
edge with weight of 2 was constructed based on 
this.

from an access log file 
3.2 Multilingualization Using Online Re-
sources 
Many researchers focused on the usage of dic-
tionaries in digital format to translate lexical 
resources automatically (Gopestake, Briscoe et 
al. 1994) (Etzioni, Reiter et al 2007). We are 
concerned with the automatic utilization of 
these resources to acquire multilingual preter-
minological resources through the following: 1) 
Wikipedia 2) online MT systems 3) online dic-
tionaries. 
Wikipedia (Wikipedia-A 2008) is a rich 
source of preterminology, it has good linguistic 
and lexical coverage. As of December, 2009, 
there are 279 Wikipedias in different languages, 
and 14,675,872 articles. There are 29 Wikipe-
dias with more that 100000 articles and 91 lan-
guages have more than 10,000 articles. Beside, 
Wikipedia is built by domain experts. We ex-
ploit the structure of Wikipedia to seed an 
MPG, by selecting a root set of terms, for each 
one of them we fetch its wikipedia article, and 
then we use the language roll of the article. For 
example, we fetch the article (Cuneiform script) 
En: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script, to reach its 
translation in Arabic from this url:  
http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/ ???????_?????  
We use also online machine translation sys-
tems as general purpose MRDs. One of the 
main advantages of MT systems is the good 
coverage even for multiword terms. The agree-
ment of some MT systems with other resources 
on the translation of one term enhanced the con-
fidence of the translation. Another positive 
point is that the results of MT provide a first 
draft to be post edited later. We used 3 MT sys-
tems: 
? Google Translate (Google 2008) (50 
languages) 
? Systran (Systran 2009) (14 languages) 
? Babylon (Babylon 2009) (26 languages) 
Here is an example of translating the term 
?great wall of China? into Arabic. 
 
Figure  3. MPG sample nodes 
In a similar way, we used several online re-
positories; to make good use of what is avail-
able and standardized, to initializing the MPG 
with various resources, and to construct a meta-
system to call online dictionaries automatically. 
We used IATE (IATE 2008)  as an example of a 
terminological db, and Google dictionary 
(Google 2008). The concept is similar to the 
concept of using online translations, where we 
construct an http request, to receive the result as 
html page. 
3.3 Graph Expansion 
 And then, the Graph is expanded by finding the 
synonyms according to formula (1) described at 
(Daoud, Boitet et al 2009). After finding syno-
nyms we assume that synonyms share the same 
translations. As Figure 4 shows, X1 and X2 have 
translations overlaps, and relatively high rw, so 
that suggest they are synonyms. Therefore we 
constructed heuristic edges between the transla-
tions of X1 and X2.

4 Human Involvement in the Develop-
ment of DSR-MPG 
After initializing the graph, we target contribu-
tions from the visitors to the DSR website. In 
this section we will start by analyzing the possi-
bility of receiving contributions from the visi-
tors, and then we will introduce some useful 
applications on the DSR-MPG that can help the 
visitors and attract them to get involved. 
4.1 Analyzing Possible Contributors of the 
DSR 
We are trying to analyze access log files to find 
out the possible contributors to a pretermi-
nological multilingual graph dedicated to an 
online community. This kind of information is 
necessary for the following reasons: 1) it pro-
vide feasibility analysis predicting the possibil-
ity of receiving contribution to a multilingual 
preterminological repository. 2) it gives infor-
mation that can be used by the collaborative 
environment to personalize the contribution 
process for those who prove to be able to con-
tribute. 
In the analysis process we are using the fol-
lowing information that can be easily extracted 
the access records: 
? Key terms to access the historical resources of 
the Digital Silk Road, whether it is the local 
search engine, or any external search engine. 
? Access frequency: number of access requests 
by a visitor over a period of time. 
? Language preferences 
? Period of visits 
Knowing these points helps determining the 
possible users who might be willing to contrib-
ute. A contributor should satisfy the following 
characteristics: 1) Loyalty 2) Multilinguality.  A 
multilingual user is a visitor who uses multilin-
gual search terms to access the online resources. 
We rank users based on their linguistic compe-
tence, we measure that by tracking users? search 
requests, and matching them with the multilin-
gual preterminological graph, users with higher 
matches in certain pair of languages are ranked 
higher. A loyal user is a user who visits the web 
site frequently and stays longer than other users. 
Users based on how many months they accessed 
the website more that k times. 
4.2 DSR-MPG Applications 
For a historical archive like the DSR, we find 
that reading and searching where the most im-
portant for users. Log files since 2003 shows 
that 80% of the project visitors were interested 
in reading the historical records. Moreover, 
around 140000 search requests have been sent 
to the internal search engine. So we imple-
mented two applications (1) ?contribute-while-
reading? and (2) ?contribute-while-searching?. 
4.2.1 Contribute While Searching 
Physical books have been digitized and indexed 
into a search engine. We expect users to send 
monolingual search requests in any language 
supported by our system to get multilingual an-
swers. Having a term base of multilingual 
equivalences could achieve this (Chen 2002). A 
bilingual user who could send a bilingual search 
request could be a valid candidate to contribute. 
We plan that users who use our search engine 
will use the DSR-pTMDB to translate their re-
quests and will contribute to the graph sponta-
neously. As Figure 5 shows, a user would trans-
late the search request, during the searching 
process; the user can ask to add new translation 
if s/he was not happy with the suggested transla-
tion, by clicking on ?Add Suggestions? to view 
a contribution page.

quest

4.2.2 Contribute While Reading 
The other application is trying to help users 
from different linguistic backgrounds to trans-
late some of the difficult terms into their lan-
guages while they are reading, simply by select-
ing a term from the screen. As shown in Figure 
6, readers will see a page from a book as an im-
age, with its OCR text. Important terms will be 
presented with yellow background. Once a term 
is clicked, a small child contribution/lookup 
window will be open, similar. Also user can 
lookup/translate any term from the screen by 
selecting it. This application helps covering all 
the important terms of each book.

5 Experimental Results 
In this section present we will present the ex-
periment of seeding DSR-MPG, and the results 
of discovering possible contributors from the 
visitors of the DSR. 
5.1 DSR-MPG Initialization 
To build the initial DSR-MPG, we used the ac-
cess log files of the DSR website (dsr.nii.ac.jp) 
from December 2003 to January 2009. The ini-
tial graph after normalization contained 89,076 
nodes.  Also we extracted 81,204 terms using 
Yahoo terms. 27,500 of them were not discov-
ered from the access files. So, the total number 
of nodes in the initial graph was 116,576 nodes, 
see Figure 7 for sample nodes. 
After multilingualization, the graph has 210,781 
nodes containing terms from the most important 
languages. The graph has now 779,765 edges 
with tw > 0.  The important languages are the 
languages of the majority of the visitors, the 
languages of the archived books, and represen-
tative languages a long the Silk Road. DSR-
MPG achieved high linguistic coverage as 20 
languages have more than 1000 nodes on the 
graph. To evaluate the produced graph, we ex-
tracted 350 English terms manually from the 
index pages of the following books: 
Ancient Khotan, vol.1: 
http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-7/V-1/

En-Ar (only correct tranlstions) En-Fr (only correct translations)
 
Figure  7. A comparison between DSR-MPG, 
and other dictionaries. The En-Ar bi-dictionary 
is Babylon (Babylon 2009), and the En-Fr bi-
dictionary was IATE. 
We assume that the terms available in these 
books are strongly related to the DSR. Hence, 
we tried to translate them into Arabic and 
French. Figure 7 compares between DSR-MPG, 
and various general purpose dictionaries. Out of 
the 350 terms, we found 189 correct direct 
translations into Arabic. However, the number 
reached 214 using indirect translations.  On the 
other hand, the closest to our result was PanI-
mages, which uses Wikitionaries and various 
dictionaries, with only 83 correct translations. 
DSR-MPG1 is the translations obtained from 
formula 1, DSR-MPG2 represents the transla-
tions obtained from indirect translations, which 
increased the amount of correct translation by 
24
25 terms in the case of En-Ar. The result can be 
progressively enhanced by accepting contribu-
tions from volunteers through the applications 
we described in the section three and the generic 
nature of MPG makes it easy to accept contribu-
tions from any dictionary or terminological da-
tabase. 
Around 55200 root English terms were used 
as a seed set of terms; these terms were selected 
from the initial DSR-MPG. Around 35000 
terms have been translated from Wikipedia into 
at least 1 language, mostly in French, German. 
Wikipedia increased the density of the graph by 
introducing around 113,000 edges (with tw).

5.2 DSR Possible Contributors 
With K=2, meaning that a multilinguality com-
petence is counted only if the two terms sent by 
a user has to have more than 2 points of transla-
tion weight on the MPG. 
The highest score was 33, achieved by this 
IP: p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp. 
That means that this user sent 33 multilingual 
search requests. We have another 115 users with 
score higher than 5.  
For example, the following two request, sent by 
one user: 
p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp
 &input=peshawar 
p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp
  &input=?????? 
On the DSR-MPG the translation weight be-
tween peshawer and ?????? = 5, thus 
this IP earned a point. With k=10, means that a 
user should send 10 requests to earn a loyalty 
point, only 309 users earned 12 point (for 12 
months), 43 of them has more than 3 points. 
6 Conclusions 
We presented our work in constructing a new 
lexical resource that can handle multilingual 
terms based on the historical archive of the 
Digital Silk Road. Multilingual Preterminologi-
cal Graphs (MPGs) are constructed based on 
domain dedicated resources, and based on vol-
unteer contributions.

Figure  10. DSR preterminology 
It compiles terms available in the pretermi-
nological sphere of a domain. In this article we 
defined the framework of the construction of 
preterminology, and we described the approach 
for using access log files to initialize such pre-
terminological resource by finding the trends in 
the search requests used to access the resources 
of an online community. Aiming at a standard-
ized multilingual repository is very expensive 
25
and difficult.  Instead of that, MPGs tries to use 
all available contributions.  This way will en-
hance the linguistic and informational coverage, 
and tuning the weights (tw, rw, and sw) will 
give indications for the confidence of the trans-
lation equivalences, as the tedges accumulate 
the agreements of the contributors and MDRs 
(online resources). 
We used the resources of the Digital Silk 
Road Project to construct a DSR-MPG and 
some applications that attract further contribu-
tion to the MPG.  DSR-MPG achieved high lin-
guistic and informational coverage compared to 
other general purpose dictionaries, Figure 10. 
Furthermore, the generic structure of the MPG 
makes it possible to accept volunteer contribu-
tions, and it facilitates further study of comput-
ing more lexical functions and ontological rela-
tions between the terms. We made a study on 
the possibility of receiving contributions from 
users, by analyzing the access log file to find 
multilinguality and loyalty of the DSR visitors; 
we found 115 users with the needed linguistic 
capacity 43 of them scored high loyalty points. 
This gives an indication of the future of the con-
tributions. These measures are just estimations 
and expected to go high with the help of the 
MPG-DSR applications.
