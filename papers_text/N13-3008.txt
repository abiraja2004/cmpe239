Abstract
We present KELVIN, an automated system for
processing a large text corpus and distilling a
knowledge base about persons, organizations,
and locations. We have tested the KELVIN
system on several corpora, including: (a) the
TAC KBP 2012 Cold Start corpus which con-
sists of public Web pages from the University
of Pennsylvania, and (b) a subset of 26k news
articles taken from English Gigaword 5th edi-
tion.
Our NAACL HLT 2013 demonstration per-
mits a user to interact with a set of search-
able HTML pages, which are automatically
generated from the knowledge base. Each
page contains information analogous to the
semi-structured details about an entity that are
present in Wikipedia Infoboxes, along with
hyperlink citations to supporting text.
1 Introduction
The Text Analysis Conference (TAC) Knowledge
Base Population (KBP) Cold Start task1 requires
systems to take set of documents and produce a
comprehensive set of <Subject, Predicate, Object>
triples that encode relationships between and at-
tributes of the named-entities that are mentioned in
the corpus. Systems are evaluated based on the fi-
delity of the constructed knowledge base. For the
2012 evaluation, a fixed schema of 42 relations (or
slots), and their logical inverses was provided, for
example:
? X:Organization employs Y:Person
1See details at http://www.nist.gov/tac/2012/
KBP/task_guidelines/index.html
? X:Person has-job-title title
? X:Organization headquartered-in Y:Location
Multiple layers of NLP software are required for
this undertaking, including at the least: detection of
named-entities, intra-document co-reference resolu-
tion, relation extraction, and entity disambiguation.
To help prevent a bias towards learning about
prominent entities at the expense of generality,
KELVIN refrains from mining facts from sources
such as documents obtained through Web search,
Wikipedia2, or DBpedia.3 Only facts that are as-
serted in and gleaned from the source documents are
posited.
Other systems that create large-scale knowledge
bases from general text include the Never-Ending
Language Learning (NELL) system at Carnegie
Mellon University (Carlson et al, 2010), and the
TextRunner system developed at the University of
Washington (Etzioni et al, 2008).
2 Washington Post KB
No gold-standard KBs were available to us to assist
during the development of KELVIN, so we relied on
qualitative assessment to gauge the effectiveness of
our extracted relations ? by manually examining ten
random samples for each relations, we ascertained
that most relations were between 30-80% accurate.
Although the TAC KBP 2012 Cold Start task was a
pilot evaluation of a new task using a novel evalua-
tion methodology, the KELVIN system did attain the
highest reported F1 scores.4

During our initial development we worked with
a 26,143 document collection of 2010 Washington
Post articles and the system discovered 194,059 re-
lations about 57,847 named entities. KELVIN learns
some interesting, but rather dubious relations from
the Washington Post articles5
? Sen. Harry Reid is an employee of the ?Repub-
lican Party.? Sen. Reid is also an employee of
the ?Democratic Party.?
? Big Foot is an employee of Starbucks.
? MacBook Air is a subsidiary of Apple Inc.
? Jill Biden is married to Jill Biden.
However, KELVIN also learns quite a number of
correct facts, including:
? Warren Buffett owns shares of Berkshire Hath-
away, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Wash-
ington Post Co., and four other stocks.
? Jared Fogle is an employee of Subway.
? Freeman Hrabowski works for UMBC,
founded the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, and
graduated from Hampton University and the
University of Illinois.
? Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan attended
Oxford, Harvard, and Princeton.
? Southwest Airlines is headquartered in Texas.

3.1 SERIF
BBN?s SERIF tool8 (Boschee et al, 2005) provides
a considerable suite of document annotations that
are an excellent basis for building a knowledge base.
The functions SERIF can provide are based largely

on the NIST ACE specification,9 and include: (a)
identifying named-entities and classifying them by
type and subtype; (b) performing intra-document
co-reference analysis, including named mentions,
as well as co-referential nominal and pronominal
mentions; (c) parsing sentences and extracting intra-
sentential relations between entities; and, (d) detect-
ing certain types of events.
In Table 1 we list the most common slots SERIF
extracts from the Washington Post articles.
3.2 FACETS
FACETS, another BBN tool, is an add-on pack-
age that takes SERIF output and produces role and
argument annotations about person noun phrases.
FACETS is implemented using a conditional-

sons, organizations, and geo-political entities (GPEs).
GPEs are inhabited locations with a government. See

exponential learner trained on broadcast news. The
attributes FACETS can recognize include general at-
tributes like religion and age (which anyone might
have), as well as role-specific attributes, such as
medical specialty for physicians, or academic insti-
tution for someone associated with an university.

3.3 CUNY toolkit
To increase our coverage of relations we also in-
tegrated the KBP Slot Filling Toolkit (Chen et al,
2011) developed at the CUNY BLENDER Lab.
Given that the KBP toolkit was designed for the tra-
ditional slot filling task at TAC, this primarily in-
volved creating the queries that the tool expected as
input and parallelizing the toolkit to handle the vast
number of queries issued in the cold start scenarios.
To informally gauge the accuracy of slots
extracted from the CUNY tool, some coarse as-
sessment was done over a small collection of 807
New York Times articles that include the string
?University of Kansas.? From this collection, 4264
slots were identified. Nine different types of slots
were filled in order of frequency: per:title (37%),
per:employee of (23%), per:cities of residence
(17%), per:stateorprovinces of residence (6%),
10Note FACETS can independently extract some slots that
SERIF is capable of discovering (e.g., employment relations).
org:top members/employees (6%), org:member of
(6%), per:countries of residence (2%), per:spouse
(2%), and per:member of (1%). We randomly sam-
pled 10 slot-fills of each type, and found accuracy
to vary from 20-70%.
3.4 Coreference
We used two methods for entity coreference. Un-
der the theory that name ambiguity may not be a
huge problem, we adopted a baseline approach of
merging entities across different documents if their
canonical mentions were an exact string match af-
ter some basic normalizations, such as removing
punctuation and conversion to lower-case charac-
ters. However we also used the JHU HLTCOE
CALE system (Stoyanov et al, 2012), which maps
named-entity mentions to the TAC-KBP reference
KB, which was derived from a 2008 snapshot of En-
glish Wikipedia. For entities that are not found in the
KB, we reverted to exact string match. CALE entity
linking proved to be the more effective approach for
the Cold Start task.
3.5 Timex2 Normalization
SERIF recognizes, but does not normalize, temporal
expressions, so we used the Stanford SUTime pack-
age, to normalize date values.

following hyperlinks.
3.6 Lightweight Inference
We performed a small amount of light inference to
fill some slots. For example, if we identified that
a person P worked for organization O, and we also
extracted a job title T for P, and if T matched a set
of titles such as president or minister we asserted
that the tuple <O, org:top members employees, P>
relation also held.
4 Ongoing Work
There are a number of improvements that we are un-
dertaking, including: scaling to much larger corpora,
detecting contradictions, expanding the use of infer-
ence, exploiting the confidence of extracted infor-
mation, and applying KELVIN to various genres of
text.
5 Script Outline
The KB generated by KELVIN is best explored us-
ing a Wikipedia metaphor. Thus our demonstration
consists of a web browser that starts with a list of
moderately prominent named-entities that the user
can choose to examine (e.g., investor Warren Buf-
fett, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, Southwest
Airlines Co., the state of Florida). Selecting any
entity takes one to a page displaying its known at-
tributes and relations, with links to documents that
serve as provenance for each assertion. On every
page, each entity is hyperlinked to its own canon-
ical page; therefore the user is able to browse the
KB much as one browses Wikipedia by simply fol-
lowing links. A sample generated page is shown in
Figure 1 and text that supports some of the learned
assertions in the figure is shown in Figure 2. We
also provide a search interface to support jump-
ing to a desired entity and can demonstrate access-
ing the data encoded in the semantic web language
RDF (World Wide Web Consortium, 2013), which
supports ontology browsing and executing complex
SPARQL queries (Prud?Hommeaux and Seaborne,
2008) such as ?List the employers of people living
in Nebraska or Kansas who are older than 40.?
