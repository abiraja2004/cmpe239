Abstract
This paper describes the creation of a re-
source of German sentences with multi-
ple automatically created alternative syn-
tactic analyses (parses) for the same text,
and how qualitative and quantitative inves-
tigations of this resource can be performed
using ANNIS, a tool for corpus querying
and visualization. Using the example of
PP attachment, we show how parsing can
benefit from the use of such a resource.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we describe the workflow and the
infrastructure to create and explore a corpus that
contains multiple parses of German sentences. A
corpus of alternative parses created by different
tools allows us to study structural differences be-
tween the parses in a systematic way.
The resource described in this paper is a collec-
tion of German sentences with -ung nominaliza-
tions extracted from the SDEWAC corpus (Faa?
et al, 2010), based on the DEWAC web corpus
(Baroni and Kilgarriff, 2006). These sentences
are employed for the study of lexical ambigui-
ties in German -ung nominalizations (Eberle et al,
2009); e.g., German Absperrung, derived from ab-
sperren ?to block?, can denote an event (?block-
ing?), a state (?blockade?) or an object (?barrier?).
Sortal disambiguation, however, is highly context-
dependent, and reliable and detailed analyses of
the linguistic context are crucial for a sortal dis-
ambiguation of these nominalizations.
More reliable and detailed linguistic analyses
can be achieved, for example, by combining the
information produced by different parsers: On the
basis of qualitative and quantitative analyses, gen-
eralized rules for the improvement of the respec-
tive parsers can be developed, as well as rules for
the mapping of their output to a tool-independent
representation, and weights for the parallel appli-
cation and combination of multiple parsers. This
approach has been previously applied to morpho-
logical and morphosyntactic annotations (Borin,
2000; Zavrel and Daelemans, 2000; Tufis?, 2000),
but only recently to syntax annotation (Francom
and Hulden, 2008; de la Clergerie et al, 2008).
Because of the complexity of syntax annotations
as compared to part of speech tags, however, novel
technologies have to be applied that allow us to
represent, to visualize and to query multiple syn-
tactic analyses of the same sentence.
This paper describes the workflow from raw text
to a searchable representation of the corpus. One
of the aims of this new resource is to assess po-
tential weaknesses in the parsers as well as their
characteristic strengths. For the example of am-
biguities in PP attachment, Sect. 4 shows how lin-
guistic analyses can be improved by combining in-
formation from different parsers.
2 Parsing
In order to maximize both coverage and gran-
ularity of linguistic analyses, we chose parsers
from different classes: A probabilistic constituent
parser and a rule-based parser that produces se-
mantically enriched dependency parses.
2.1 BitPar
BitPar (Schmid, 2006) is a probabilistic context
free parser using bit-vector operations (Schmid,
2004). Node categories are annotated along with
grammatical functions, part-of-speech tags and
morphological information in a parse tree. BitPar
analyses are conformant to the TIGER annotation
scheme (Brants et al, 2004), and the tool?s output
format is similar to the list-based bracketing for-
mat of the Penn Treebank (Bies et al, 1995). The
BitPar analysis of sentence (1) is visualized as the
right-most tree in Fig. 1.

2.2 B3 Tool
The second parser applied here is the B3 Tool
(Eberle et al, 2008), a rule-based parser that
provides syntactic-semantic analyses that com-
bine dependency parsing with FUDRT represen-
tations.1 The B3 Tool is developed on the basis
of a research prototype by Lingenio2 in the con-
text of a project on lexical ambiguities in German
nominalizations3.
For further processing, the output of the B3 Tool
is converted into a PTB-style bracketing format
similar to that used by BitPar. This transformation
involves the generation of a constituency graph
from the original dependency analysis: In the first
step, rules are used that insert nodes and projec-
tions as described by Eberle (2002). Then, another
transformation step is necessary: As the B3 Tool
aims for an abstract, flat semantics-oriented struc-
ture, certain aspects of the surface structure are not
represented in its output and need to be restored in
order to create analyses that can be aligned with
constituent-based representations. For example,
punctuation marks do not appear as leaves of the
syntactic tree, as their contribution is included in
the description of the head verb. Similarly, aux-
iliaries are not represented as individual words in
the B3 output, as their tense and aspect informa-
tion is integrated with the event description that
corresponds to the head verb.4 As we focus on the
integration of multiple syntactic analyses, leaves
from the B3 Tool output that represent semantic
information were not considered, e.g., information
on coreference.
The converted B3 analysis of sentence (1) is vi-
sualized as the left tree in Fig. 1.

derforschungsbereich) SFB 732, Stuttgart, Germany.
4For the study described here, punctuation marks were
added to the surface structure but auxiliaries not yet. There
are several possible approaches to dealing with these struc-
tural aspects (e.g. inserting empty elements, converting Bit-
Par into B3-like representations, etc.). The discussion of
these strategies is, however, beyond the scope of this tech-
nical paper.
3 Querying and Visualizing Alternative
Parses
In order to integrate multiple annotations created
by different tools, we employ a generic XML for-
mat, PAULA XML (Dipper and Go?tze, 2005).
PAULA XML is an XML linearization of the data
model underlying the ANNIS data base.5 It is
comparable to NITE XML (Carletta et al, 2005)
and GrAF (Ide, 2007). PAULA XML supports di-
verse data structures (trees, graphs, and flat spans
of tokens) and allows for conflicting hierarchies.
The integrated PAULA representation of the
multiple-parses corpus can be accessed using AN-
NIS, a web interface for querying and visualizing
richly annotated corpora. Fig. 1 shows the ANNIS
interface: top left is the query field; below that is
the ?match count? field (presenting the number of
instances matching the query). Below this field is
the list of corpora the user choses from. Matches
are visualized in the right window. Tokens and
token-level annotations are shown in a Key Word
In Context (KWIC) view (upper part of the search
result pane in Fig. 1), e.g., B3 morphology (2nd
row), BitPar parts of speech (3rd row), and BitPar
morphology (4th row). Trees are visualized with
the Tree view (below KWIC view).
4 Exploiting multiple parses
The goal of our research is to develop rules for
the combination of BitPar and B3 parses such that
the resulting merged parse provides more reliable
linguistic analyses than the ones provided by ei-
ther alone. The rule-based B3 Tool provides deep
semantic analyses. B3 parses are thus generally
richer in information than BitPar parses. Certain
ambiguities, however, are not resolved but rather
represented by underspecification. In this section,
we explore the possibility to employ BitPar parses
to resolve such underspecifications.
4.1 Studying PP attachment in ANNIS
The attachment of prepositional phrases is often
ambiguous between high attachment (e.g., PP as a
clausal adjunct) and low attachment (PP as a nom-
inal modifier). In such cases, the B3 Tool employs
underspecification, which is represented by a spe-
cial edge label xprep.6
5PAULA and ANNIS have been developed at the Col-
laborative Research Centre 632, http://www.sfb632.
uni-potsdam.de/?d1/annis/.
6The xprep label indicates underspecification as to
whether the PP has to be attached to its parent node or a node
167
Figure 1: ANNIS2 screenshot with query results
for QUERY 1
Using ANNIS, we retrieve all cases where a Bit-
Par PP corresponds to a B3 PP with the edge la-
beled xprep (the query used to accomplish this
will be referenced by QUERY 1 in the following).
Fig. 1 illustrates an example match: The B3 PP
(left tree) is attached to the root node with an edge
label xprep; in the BitPar analysis (right tree),
the prepositional phrase is correctly attached to the
other PP node.
Using an extended query, we conducted a quan-
titative analysis comparing the node labels as-
signed to the parent node of the respective PPs in
BitPar parses and B3 parses.
Considering only those matches where the B3
parent node was either VP or S (85%, 35 of 41),
high attachment is indicated by BitPar labels VP
or S for the BitPar parent node (34%, 12 of 35)
and low attachment by labels PP or NP (66%, 23
of 35). BitPar thus distinguishes low and high PP
attachment, with a preference for low attachment
in our data set.
Results of a subsequent qualitative analysis of
the first 20 matches retrieved by this query are
summarized in Tab. 1: Only 16% (3 of 19) Bit-
Par predictions are incorrect, 32% (6 of 19) are
possible (but different attachment would have pro-
duced a felicitous reading), and 53% (10 of 19) are
correct. BitPar analyses of PP attachment are thus

relatively reliable, and where the B3 Tool indicates
underspecification with respect to PP attachment,
the point of attachment can be adopted from the
BitPar parse. With such a merging of BitPar parses
and B3 parses, a more detailed and more reliable
analysis is possible.
4.2 Merging B3 and BitPar parses
With the information from the comparison of Bit-
Par and B3 Tool attachments, a workflow is imag-
inable where both parsers are applied in paral-
lel, and then their output is merged into a com-
mon representation. As opposed to traditional ap-
proaches that reduce parse integration to a selec-
dominated by its parent.
168
tion between entire parses, cf. Crysmann et al
(2002), we employ a full merging between B3
parses and BitPar parses. This merging is based
on hand-crafted rules that express preferences be-
tween pieces of information from one parse or the
other in accordance with the results of quantitative
and qualitative analyses as described above.
B3 parses can be enriched with structural infor-
mation from BitPar, e.g., by the following exem-
plaric rule:7 if the B3 parse indicates underspec-
ification with respect to the PP attachment point
(QUERY 1), establish a dominance edge between
(i) the correspondent of the Bitpar PP (the PP
?from London? in the example) and (ii) the corre-
spondent of its parent node (the PP ?to the news?),
and delete the original, underspecified B3 edge.
The same procedure can also be applied to per-
form corrections of a parse, if further quantitative
and qualitative studies indicate that, for example,
the B3 parser systematically fails at a particular
phenomenon.
In some cases, we may also want to employ
context-dependent rules to exploit the advanta-
geous characteristics of a specific parser, e.g., to
preserve ambiguities. Example (2) illustrates that
PP attachment has an effect on the sortal interpre-
tation of Absperrung ?barrier/blocking/blockade?:
Different points of attachment can produce dif-
ferent possible readings. The PP by the police
specifies the subject of the nominalized verb ab-
sperren ?to block?. This indicates that here, the
event/state readings are preferred over the object
(=entity) reading.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we described the creation of a re-
source of German sentences with parallel parses
and the infrastructure employed to exploit this re-
source. We also identified possible fields of ap-
plication for this resource: By querying this re-
source one finds strong tendencies regarding the
relative reliability and level of detail of different

parsers; on this basis, the strengths of several tools
can be weighted, as represented, e.g., by general-
ized, context-dependent rules to combine the out-
put of multiple parsers. Here, this approach was
illustrated for two parsers and their combination to
disambiguate PP attachment as part of a study of
German -ung nominalizations. A future perspec-
tive could be to add more tools to the comparison,
find out their characteristic strengths and perform
a sort of weighted voting to decide when an ana-
lysis should be enhanced by the information from
another one.
We have shown that the infrastructure provided
by the ANNIS data base and the underlying data
format PAULA can be employed to conduct this
kind of research. Although originally developed
for different purposes (representation and query-
ing of richly annotated corpora), its generic char-
acter allowed us to apply it with more than satis-
factory results to a new scenario.
Subsequent research may further exploit the po-
tential of the ANNIS/PAULA infrastructure and
the development of application-specific exten-
sions. In particular, it is possible to register in
ANNIS a problem-specific visualization for par-
allel parses that applies in place of the generic
tree/DAG view for the namespaces bitpar and
b3. Another extension pertains to the handling of
conflicting tokenizations: The algorithm described
by Chiarcos et al (2009) is sufficiently generic
to be applied to any PAULA project, but it may
be extended to account for B3-specific deletions
(Sect. 2.2). Further, ANNIS supports an annota-
tion enrichment cycle: Matches are exported as
WEKA tables, statistical, symbolic or neural clas-
sifiers can be trained on or applied to this data, and
the modified match table can be reintegrated with
the original corpus. This allows, for example, to
learn an automatic mapping between B3 and Bit-
Par annotations.
