ABSTRACT 
A method of sense resolution is proposed that is based on WordNet, an 
on-line lexical database that incorporates semantic relations (synonymy, 
antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, causal and troponymic entailment) as 
labeled pointers between word senses. With WordNet, it is easy to 
retrieve sets of semantically rehted words, a facility that will be used for 
sense resolution during text processing, as follows. When a word with 
multiple senses is encountered, one of two procedures will be followed. 
Either, (1) words related in meaning to the alternative senses of the 
polysemous word will be retrieved; new strings will be derived by substi- 
tuting these related words into the context of the polysemous word; a 
large textual corpus will then be searched for these derived strings; and 
that sense will be chosen that corresponds to the derived string that is 
found most often in the corpus. Or, (2) the context of the polysemous 
word will be used as a key to search a large corpus; all words found to 
occur in that context will be neted; Word.Net will then be used to estimate 
the semantic distance from those words to the alternative senses of the 
polysemous word; and that sense will be chosen that is closest in meaning 
to other words occurring in the same contexL If successful, this pro- 
cedure could have practical applications to problems of information 
retrieval, mechan/cal translation, intelligent tutoring systems, and else- 
where. 
BACKGROUND 
An example can set the problem. Suppose that an automatic tran- 
scription device were to recognize the string of phonemes/ralt/ in 
the flow of speech and could correctly identify it as an English 
word; the device would still have to decide whether the word 
should be spelled right, write, or rite. And if the result were then 
sent to a language understanding system, there would be a further 
problem of deciding which sense of the word the speaker 
intended to communicate. These decisions, which are made 
rapidly and unconsciously by human listeners, are difficult to 
accomplish computationally. Ordinarily, anyone who reads and 
writes English will be able to listen to the context of a string like 
/rait/and quickly decide which sense is appropriate. The task is 
so easy, in fact, that laymen unfamiliar with these matters find it 
hard to understand what the problem is. But computers have 
trouble using context to make such apparently simple lexieal 
decisions. How those troubles might be overcome is the subject 
of this paper. 
The process under consideration here is called "lexical disambi- 
guation," although that terminology can be misleading. In the 
everyday use of linguistic communication, true ambiguity is 
remarkably rare. In the present context, however, "ambiguity" 
has taken on a special meaning that derives, apparently, from the 
claim by Katz and Fodor (1963) that semantics, like syntax, 
should be restricted to sentences, "without reference to inforrna- 
tion about seaings" (p. 174). Many sentences are indeed ambi- 
guous when viewed in a contextual vacuum. More to the point, 
as Katz and Fodor emphasized, most words, when taken in isola- 
tion, are ambiguous in just this sense; they convey different 
meanings when used in different linguistic settings. Hence, lexi- 
cal disambiguation is the process (either psychological or compu- 
tational) that reduces this putative ambiguity--that results in the 
selection of the appropriate sense of a polysemous word. "Sense 
resolution" might be a better term, but by now "disambigua- 
t ion" is firmly established in the technical literature. 
Much attention has been given to lexical disarnbiguation by stu- 
dents of language tmderstanding. In an excellent survey, Hirst 
(1987) distinguishes three types of lexical ambiguity: categorical, 
homonyrnous, and polysemous. A word is categorically ambigu- 
ous if it can be used in different syntactic ategories; right, for 
example, can be used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, or an 
adverb. A word is a homonym if it has two clearly different 
senses; as an adjective, for example, right can mean the opposite 
of wrong or the opposite of left. A word is polysemous if it has 
senses that are different but closely related; as a noun, for exam- 
ple, right can mean something that is morally approved, or some- 
thing that is factually correct, or something that is due one. So 
defined, the distinction between homonymy and pelyserny 
becomes a matter of degree that is often difficult to draw; some 
lexicographers have tried to draw it on etymological grounds. For 
the present discussion, however, the distinction will be ignored; 
homonymy and polysemy will be referred to together simply as 
polysemy. 
Categorical ambiguity, however, is of a different kind and is 
resolved in a different way. For the purposes of the present 
paper, it will be assumed that only content words are at issue, and 
that the syntactic ategory of all content words in the text that is 
under study can be determined automatically (Church, 1988; 
DeRose, 1988). The problem is simply to decide which sense of 
a content word--noun, verb, adjective, or adverb---is appropriate 
in a given linguistic context. It will also be assumed that sense 
resolution for individual words can be accomplished on the basis 
of information about the irnrnediate linguistic context. It should 
be noted that this is an important simplification. Inferences based 
on knowledge of the world are frequently required to resolve 
uncertainties about a speaker's intentions in uttering a particular 
sentence, and endowing computers with such general knowledge 
in a usuable form is a particularly formidable problem. Sense 
resolution for individual words, however, promises to be more 
manageable.

Hirst (1987) has reviewed various attempts o program computers 
to use linguistic ontexts in order to perform lexical disambigua- 
tion; that information eed not be repeated here. It should be 
noted, however, that there are two contrasting ways to think 
about linguistic ontexts, one based on co-oocurrence and the 
other on substitutability (Charles and Miller, 1989; Miller and 
Charles, 1991), usually referred to (Jenkins, 1954) as the syntag- 
marie and paradigmatic views. The eo-eceurronce or syntagmafie 
approach olds the target word constant and compares the con- 
texts in which it can appear; the substitutability or paradigmatic 
approach olds the context constant and compares the words that 
can appear in it. According to the co-occurrence approach, asso- 
ciations are formed between a word and the other words that 
occur with it in the same phrases and sentences; most psycho- 
linguists assume that syntagrnatie word associations are a conse- 
quence of temporal and spatial contiguity. Many attempts to 
automate lexical disambiguation have exploited these co- 
occurrence associations. Lesk (1986) provides an elegantly sim- 
ple example: each sense of the polysemous word is retrieved 
from an on-line dictionary and compared with the target son- 
tence; the sense is chosen that has the most words in common 
with the target sentence. According to the substitutability view, 
on the other hand, associations are formed between words that 
can be substituted into similar contexts; most psycholinguists 
assume that paradigmatic word associations between words are 
mediated by their common contexts. Syntactic categories of 
words, for example, must be learned on the basis of their inter- 
substitutability; Miller and Charles (1991) have argued that 
semantic similarities between words are also learned on the basis 
of inter-substitutability. 
The present proposal is an attempt to exploit paradigmatic associ- 
ations for the purpose of lexical disambiguation. That is to say, it 
is proposed to use the substitutability of semantically similar 
words in order to determine which sense of a polysemous word is 
appropriate. In order to explain where the semantically similar 
words might come from, however, it is necessary to describe the 
lexical database that is a central component of the present propo- 
sal for lexical disambiguation. 
WordNet 
Standard alphabetical procedures for organizing lexical informa- 
tion put together words that are spelled alike and scatter words 
with related meanings haphazardly through the list. WordNet 
(Miller, 1990) is an attempt to use computers in order to achieve 
a more efficient organization f the lexicon of English. Inasmuch 
as it instantiates hypotheses based on results of psycholinguisfic 
research, it can be said to be a dictionary based on psycholinguis- 
tic principles. One obvious difference from a conventional on- 
line dictionary is that WordNet divides the lexicon into four syn- 
tactic categories: nouns, verbs, modifiers, and fimction words. In 
fact, WordNet contains only nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
Adverbs are omitted on the assumption that most of them dupli- 
cate adjectives; the relatively small set of English function words 
is omitted on the assumption that they are stored separately as 
part of the syntactic omponent. The most ambitious feature, 
however, is the attempt to organize lexical information i  terms 
of word meanings, rather than word forms. In that respect, 
WordNet resembles a thesaurus. It is not merely an on-line 
thesaurus, however. In order to appreciate what more has been 
attempted, it is necessary tounderstand the basic design. 
Lexical semantics begins with a recognition that a word is a con- 
ventional association between a lexicalizad concept and an utter- 
ance that plays a syntactic role. The basic structure of any lexi- 
396 
con is a many:many mapping between word forms and word 
senses (Miller, 1986), with syntactic ategory as a parameter. 
When a particular word form can be used to express two or more 
word senses it is said to be polysemous; when a particular word 
sense can be expressed by two or more word forms they are said 
to be synonymous (relative to a context). Initially, WordNet was 
to be concerned solely with the relations between word senses, 
but as the work proceeded it became increasingly clear that ques- 
tions of relations between word forms could not be ignored. For 
lexical disambiguation, however, word meanings are crucial, so 
this description will focus on semantic relations. 
How word senses are to be represented is a central question for 
any theory of lexical semantics. In WordNet, a lexicalizad con- 
cept is represented by simply listing the word forms that can (in 
an appropriate context) be used to express it: {W l, W 2 . . . .  }. 
(The curly brackets are used to surround sets of synonyms, or 
synsets.) For example, board can signify either a piece of lumber 
or a group of people assembled for some purpose; these two 
senses can be represented by the synsets {board, plank} and 
{board, committee}. These synsets do not explain what the con- 
cepts are; they serve merely to signal that two different concepts 
exist. People who know English are assumed to have already 
acquired the concepts and are expected to recognize them from 
the words listed in the synsets. 
The mapping between word forms and word senses, therefore, 
can be represented asa mapping between written words and syn- 
sets. Since English is rich in synonyms, synsets are often 
sufficient for differentiation, but sometimes an appropriate 
synonym is not available. In thai case, the lexicalized concept 
can be represented by a short gloss, e.g., {board, (a person's 
meals, provided regularly for money)}. The gloss is not intended 
for use in constructing a new lexical concept, and differs from a 
synonym in that it is not used to gain access to stored informa- 
tion. Its purpose is simply to enable users to distinguish this 
sense from others with which it could be confused. 
WordNet is organized by semantic relations. A great variety of 
semantic relations could be defined, of course, but this work was 
limited not only to relations that lay persons can appreciate 
without advanced training in linguistics, but also to relations that 
have broad application throughout the lexicon. In that way it was 
hoped to capture the gross semantic structure of the English lexi- 
con, even though particular semantic domains (e.g., kin terms, 
color terms) may not be optimally analyzed. 
Since a semantic relation is a relation between meanings, and 
since meanings are here represented by synsets, it is natural to 
think of semantic relations as labeled pointers between synsets. In 
the case of synonymy and antonymy, however, the semantic rela- 
tion is a relation between words. 
Synonymy: The most important semantic relation in WordNet 
is synonymy, since it allows the formation of synsets to represent 
senses. According to one definition (usually attributed to Leib- 
niz) two expressions are synonymous if the substitution of one 
for the other never changes the truth value of a statement in 
which the substitution is made. By that definition, true synonyms 
are rare in natural languages. A weakened version of the 
definition would make synonymy relative to a context: two 
expressions are synonymous in a context C if the substitution of
one for the other in C does not alter the truth value. For example, 
the substitution of plank for board will seldom alter the truth 
value in carpentry contexts, although in other contexts that substi- 
tution might be totally inappropriate. Note that this definition of 
synonymy in terms of substitutability makes it necessary toparti- 
tion the lexicon into nouns, adjectives, and verbs. That is to say, 
if concepts are represented by synsets, and if synonyms must be 
inter-substitutable, then words in different syntactic ategories 
cannot form synsets because they are not inter-substitutable. 
Antonymy: Another familiar semantic relation is antonymy. 
Like synonymy, antonymy is a semantic relation between words, 
not between concepts. For example, the meanings {rise, ascend} 
and {fall, descend} may be conceptual opposites, but they are not 
antonyms; rise/fail are antonyms, and ascend/descend are anto- 
nyms, but most people hesitate and look thoughtful when asked 
whether ise and descend, or fall and ascend, are antonyms. 
Antonymy provides the central organizing relation for adjectives: 
every predicable adjective ither has a direct antonym or is simi- 
lar to another adjective that has a direct antonym. Moist, for 
example, does not have a direct antonym, but it is similar to wet, 
which has the antonym dry; thus, dry is an indirect antonym of 
moist. 
Hyponymy: Hypenymy is a semantic relation between mean- 
ings: e.g., {map/e} is a hyponym of {tree}, and {tree} is a hypo- 
nym of {plant}. Considerable attention has been devoted to 
hyponymy/hypemyrny (variously called 
subordinatiordsuperordination, subset/superset, or the ISA rela- 
tion). Hyponymy is transitive and asymmetrical, nd, since there 
is normally a single superordinate, it generates a hierarchical 
semantic structure, or tree. Such hierarchical representations are 
widely used in information retrieval systems, where they are 
known as inheritance systems (Touretsky, 1986); a hyponym 
inherits all of the features of is superordinates. Hypenymy pro- 
vides the central organizing principle for nouns. 
Meronymy: The part/whole (or rtASA) relation is known to lexi- 
cal semanticists as meronymy/holonymy. One concept x is a 
memnym of another concept y if native speakers accept such con- 
structions as An x is a part of  y or y has x as a part. If x is a 
meronym of y, then it is also a meronym of all hyponyms ofy. 
Entailment: A variety of entailment relations hold between 
verbs. For example, the semantic relation between kill and die is 
one of causal entailment; tokill is to cause to die. Similarly, the 
semantic relation between march and walk is troponymy, an 
entailment of manner; to march is to walk in a certain manner. 
Other types of entailment hold between marry and divorce; a 
divorce entails a prior marriage. These entailments, along with 
synonymy and antonymy, provide the central organizing princi- 
ples for the verb lexicon. 
It should be obvious that, given this semantic organization of the 
lexical database, it is a simple matter to retrieve sets of words that 
have similar senses. The next step is to consider how such 
related words can be used for lexical disambiguation. 
397 
THE PROPOSED SYSTEM 
It is assumed that a grammatical text is to be processed, and that 
the processor is expected to use the textual context o determine 
the appropriate sense of each successive content word. Then, in 
brief outline, the present proposal envisions a processor that will 
perform three operations: 
(1) Take a content word from the text and look it up in the lexical 
database; if a single sense is found, the problem is solved. If 
more than one sense is found, continue. 
(2) Determine the syntactic ategory of each sense. If a single 
category is involved, go to operation three. If more than one 
syntactic ategory is found, use a "parts" program to deter- 
mine the appropriate eatagory. If the word has only one sense 
as a member of that category, the problem is solved. If the 
word has more than one sense in the appropriate syntactic 
category, continue. 
(3) Determine which sense of the polysemous word is appropri- 
ate to the text. If the word is a noun, determine which sense 
can serve as an argument of the verb, or can be modified by 
an accompanying adjective. If the word is verb or adjective, 
determine which sense can be combined with an accompany- 
ing noun phrase. 
The final operation is the critical step, of course, but before 
describing how it might be implemented, a simplified example 
will help to make the central idea clear. Suppose the processor 
encounters the sentence, the baby is in the pen, and tries to assign 
the appropriate s nse to the noun pen. It would first generalize the 
given context (e.g., with respect to number and tense), then find 
words that are semantically related to the various senses of pen 
and substitute them into the generalized context. It would then 
undertake a comparison of: 
(a/the baby is/was)/(the/some babies are/were) in a/the: 
(a) fountain pen~pencil~quill~crayon~stylus 
(b) sty/coop/cage/fold~pound 
(e ) playpen/playroomlnursery 
(d) prison~penitentiary/jail/brig~ dungeon 
( e ) swan/cygnet~goose~duck~owl 
In order to decide that one of these is acceptable and the others 
are unlikely, the processor might search an extensive corpus for 
strings of the form "(a/the baby is/was)/(the babies are/were) in 
the X," where X is one of the closely related words listed above. 
If the playpen/playroom~nursery expressions significantly out- 
number the others, the conventionally correct choice can be 
made. In other words, the processor will interrogate a corpus 
much the way a linguist might ask a native informant: "Can you 
say this in your language?" 
That is the basic strategy. Words related in meaning to the dif- 
ferent senses of the polysemous word will be retrieved; new 
expressions will be derived by substituting these related words 
into the generalized context of the polysemous word; a large tex- 
tual corpus will then be searched for these derived expressions; 
that sense will be chosen that corresponds to the derived expres- 
sion that is found most often in the corpus. (Alternatively, all 
contexts of the semantically related words could be collected and 
their similarity to the target context could be estimated.) 
We assume that the similarity of this strategy to the theory of 
spreading activation (Quilliam 1968, 1969) is obvious. Of 
course, in order even to approach the best possible implementa- 
tion, a variety of possibilities will have to be explored. For 
example, how much context should be preserved? Too short, and 
it will not discriminate between different senses; too long and no 
instances will be found in the corpus. Should the grammatical 
integriw of the contexts be preserved? Or, again, how large a 
corpus will be required? Too small, and no instances will be 
found; too large and the system will be unacceptably large or the 
response unacceptably slow. Fortunately, most of the 
polysemous words occur relatively frequently in everyday usage, 
so a corpus of several million words should be adequate. Or, still 
again, how closely related should the semantically related words 
be? Can superordinate rms be substituted? How far can the 
contexts be generalized? Experience should quickly guide the 
choice of sensible answers. 
As described so far, the proessor begins with WordNet in order to 
find semantically related words that can be searched for in a 
corpus. Obviously, it could all be done in the reverse order. That 
is to say, the processor could begin by searching the corpus for 
the given generalized context. In the above example, it might 
search for "(a/the baby is/was)/(the babies are/were) in the Y," 
where Y is any word at all. Then, given the set of Y words, 
WordNet could be used to estimate the semantic distance from 
these words to the alternative s nses of the polysemous word. A 
similarity metric could easily be constructed by simply counting 
the number of pointers between terms. That sense would be 
chosen that was closest in meaning to the other words that were 
found to occur in the same context. 
Whether WordNet is used to provide related words or to measure 
semandc similarity, amajor component of the present proposal is 
the search of a large textual corpus. Since the corpus would not 
need to be continually updated, it should be practical to develop 
an inverted index, i.e., to divide the corpus into sentence items 
that can be keyed by the content words in WordNet, then to com- 
pute hash codes and write inverted files (Lesk, 1978). In 'this 
way, a small file of relevant sentences could be rapidly assembled 
for more careful examination, sothe whole process could be con- 
dueted on-line. Even if response times were satisfactorily short, 
however, one feels that once a particular context has been used to 
disambiguate a polysemous word, it should never have to be done 
again. That thought opens up possibilities for enlarging WordNet 
that we will not speculate about at the present time. 
SOME OBVIOUS APPLICATIONS 
Several practical applications could result from a refiable lexical 
disambiguation device. The fact that people see concepts where 
computers see strings of characters i a major obstacle to human- 
machine interaction. 
Consider this situation. A young student who is reading an 
assignment encounters an unfamifiar word. When a dictionary is
consulted it turns out that the word has several senses. The stu- 
dent reconsiders the original context, testing each definitional 
gloss in turn, and eventually chooses a best fit. It is a slow pro- 
398 
cess and a serious interruption of the student's task of under- 
standing the text. Now compare this alternative. A computer is
preumfing a reading assignment to the same studant when an 
unfamiliar word appears. The student points to the word and the 
computer, which is able solve the polysemy problem, presents to 
the student only the meaning that is appropriate in the given 
context--as if a responsive teacher were sitting at the student's 
side. The desired information is presented rapidly and the real 
task of understanding is not interrupted. 
Or think of having a lexical disambiguator in your word process- 
ing system. As you write, it could flag for you every word in 
your text that it could not disambiguate on the basis of the con- 
text you have provided. It might even suggest alternative word- 
ings. 
The application to mechanical translation is also obvious. A 
polysemous word in the source language must be disambiguated 
before an appropriate word in the target language can be selected. 
The feasibility of multilingual WordNets has not been explored. 
Finally, consider the importance of disambiguation for informa- 
tion retrieval systems. If, say, you were a radar engineer looking 
for articles about antennas and you were to ask an information 
retrieval system for every article it had with antenna in the title or 
abstract., you might receive unwanted articles about insects and 
erustaceans---the so-called problem of false drops. So you revise 
your descriptor to, say, metal antenna nd try again. Now you 
have eliminated the animals, but you have also eliminated articles 
about metal antennas that did not bother to include the word 
metal in the title or abstract--the so-called problem of misses. 
False drops and misses are the Scylla and Charybdis of informa- 
tion relrieval; anything that reduces one tends to increase the 
other. But note that a lexical disambiguator could increase the 
probability of selecting only those titles and abstracts in which 
the desired sense was appropriate; the efficiency of information 
retrieval would be significantly increased. 
In short, a variety of practical advances could be implemented if 
it were possible to solve the problem of lexical ambiguity in 
some tidy and reliable way. The problem lies at the heart of the 
process of turning word forms into word meanings. But the very 
reason lexical disambiguation is important is also the reason that 
it is difficult.
