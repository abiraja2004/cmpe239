1 Introduction 
Common verbs such as "take," "have," 
"make," and "give" appear frequently in Eng- 
lish. These verbs quite often constitute verb - 
deverbal noun structures such as "make an ad- 
dress," give an answer" and "take an approach." 
The verbs in the structure arc ahnost devoid of 
lexical meaning but bear syntactic information 
such as tense, number and person; the deverbal 
noun carrying the lexical meaning. The verbs, 
in this case, are cal led "dclexical verbs" 
\[Collins\] or "light verbs," \[Live\] which refers to 
their lexical emptiness. 
In this paper, we call such verbs Delexical 
Verbs (DV) and a "DV + deverbal noun struc- 
ture" a Delexical Structure (DS) Iollowing the 
examples ol' \[Collins\]. The frequency of these 
verbs in actual text can be seen, for example, in 
the COLLINS COBUILD ENGLISH DIC- 
TIONARY, where the pmagraph on the entry 
"take" states: "The most frequent use of take is in 
expressions where it does not have a very dis- 
tinct meaning of its" own, but where most of  the 
meaning is in the noun that follows it..." 
We have been developing an English to Japa- 
nese machine translation system for news broad- 
casts since 1989 \[Aizawa\] \[Tanaka\]. The precise 
translation of DS's in news texts is of great im- 
portance since they are quite frequent here. We 
counted the number of "take" + "noun" colloca- 
tions (as verb + object) in 21 months' worth of 
AP texts using the parser of the machine transla- 
tion system. "Take" collocated with 2,188 dif- 
ferent nouns a total of 20,271 times. Of the col- 
locating nouns, 87 deverbal nouns were found 
out of the 119 deverbal nouns listed in \[Live\], 
comprising about 28% (5,726) of all occur- 
rences. This figure strongly supports the state- 
ment in the Collins Dictionary. 
Failures in DS translation typically result 
from producing the primary sense instead of the 
delexical sense of the DV, which greatly dete- 
rioratcs the quality of the translation. For ex- 
ample, "make an address" becomes "enzetsu wo 
tsukuru," which meaTts "create an address." 
There are two possible ways of translating a 
DS. The first is the idiosyncratic approach, list- 
ing all the DS's with their Japanese translations 
in a lexical system. This approach, however, 
suffers fi'om several shortcomings: 
(1) The DS's are numerous and hard to list 
exhaustively: some DS's allow pttssivization 
and some deverbal nouns can be modified 
by quantifiers, adjectives and so on. This 
doubles and triples the number of possible 
DS combinations. 
(2) This direct method is unable to infer the 
translation of a DS undefined in a lexicon. 
(3) The use of this approach increases the 
nulnber of lexical entries, making lexical 
management difficult. 
Another approach is to synthesize the transla- 
tion of a DS using the word sense of each com- 
ponent with syntactic and semantic rules. The 
attractive part of this "synthetic approach" is that 
it does not suffer from the problems mentioned 
above. The "ntonosenty approach" proposed in 
\[Ruhl\] can be viewed as the extreme manifesta- 
tion of the synthetic approach. A recent lexical 
framework \[Bograev\] proposes to generate the 
word sense instead of listing them exhaustively 
in a lexicon, which is similar to the synthetic 
approach. 
However, fl'om a practical viewpoint, not MI 
DS's can bc translated by this approach as the 
necessary rules have not yet been factored out. 
We propose the use of a DS translation method 
based mainly on synthesis, and the employment 
of all idiosyncratic approach where synthesis is 
difficult. To do this, DS's were categorized into 
three groups, called type-l ,  type-2, and idio- 
matic DS. The first two groups are translated by 
the synthetic method and the last group is trans- 
ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES. 23-28 AOt~r 1992 5 6 7 PROC. OF COLING-92, NA~CrES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
lated by an idiosyncratic approach which can 
hopefully be integrated into the former part as 
research reveals the underlying rules. This 
method should provide clear distinctions be- 
tween idiomatic and synthesizable DS's through 
the use of a set of rules, which would facilitate 
the management of lexical systems. 
The translation rules are quite simple tbr the 
following reasons: 
(1) English DS~s have Japanese quivalents 
in many cases, and some parallels can be 
seen between them. 
(2) Many Japanese "verbal nouns" take the 
form of "sahen-meishi," which become 
verbs by simply adding "suru" to the tail. 
However, some DS's require translation in a 
passive sense. The conditions were factored out 
through semantic onsideration, and were inte- 
grated into the translation rules. 
The rules were implemented in the machine 
translation system and AP news texts were 
translated appropriately, thus proving the feasi- 
bility of this method. 
2 Delexical Structures 
This section introduces ome definitions and 
characteristics of DS's. ADS basically takes the 
fo ml: 
Delexieal Verb + (determiner) +Deverbal 
Noun 
0: optional 
as in "give an answer," "make an array," 
"take an approach," have a battle," "take ad- 
vice," and "make an announcement." Verbs 
such as "put," "cast," "pay," "lay," and "throw" 
are also known to work as delexical verbs 
\[Live\]. These are commonly-used transitive 
verbs. 
DS's have some interesting semantic harac- 
teristics. A verb can be substituted for a DS in 
many cases, but the substitution isone way: thus 
"step" for "take a step" but not "take a move" for 
"move" \[Live\]. The verb-substitutable DS's 
choose one of possibly several word senses of 
the corresponding verb except when they are 
metaphoric. The selection is controlled by the 
co-occuring DV. Thus the same deverbal noun 
can form DS's which represent different mean- 
ings. 
make an order ==> request for supply 
of goods 
give an order ==> command 
The DS's give a greater colloquial \[Konishi\] 
and euphemistic impression \[Yamanashi\] than 
the corresponding verb expressions and used 
frequently in modern English \[Live\]. 
Another feature of a DS is that it gives the 
impression that the event is brief.' 
She gave a scream. (brief) 
She screamed. (not brief) 
\[Collins\] 
Some syntactic operations are possible on 
DS's. For example, adjectives and possessive 
pronouns can modify the deverbal noun, and 
some DS's can be used in passive forms. 
In this paper, determiners are mainly consid- 
ered as the modifier of the deverbal noun since 
they are the basic modifier of the DS's. The 
verbs "take," "make," "have," and "give" are 
studied since these are the most common DV's. 
As a result, we are able to obtain a DS in the 
following form: 
DV + (det) + NV (1) 
0: optional 
DV: Delexieal Verb (take, make, 
have, give) 
det: a, an, the 
NV: Deverbal noun 
3 Categorization of DS's 
The previous section mentioned that a DS 
chooses a single sense of the corresponding 
verb. An example is shown in figure 1. 
DS 
~ C give all answer )  answer (verb) 
1 say, write or do something in 
response to somebody 
2 be suitable for 
I 
Figure 1 Word sense selection 
Since a deverbal noun in a DS possesses 
some nominal sense of the matching verb, we 
can assume that a DS chooses a single sense of 
the deverbal noun and verbalizes it as shown in 
figure 2. 
We term this kind of DS an ordinary DS. A 
DS which cannot select any sense for a deverbal 
noun is termed an idiomatic DS. 
An ordinary DS can further be categorized 
into a type-1 DS or a type-2 DS. ADS which 
verbalizes the primary meaning of a deverbal

4 Translation strategy 
This section describes the basic strategy of 
DS translation. A concrete implementation will 
be described in section 6. 
4.1 Parallels between Japanese and English 
The DS categorization i  section three was 
based on the selection of word senses for an 
English deverbal nouns. In many cases, we can 
assume parallels between English and Japanese: 
(1) The word sense of an English deverbal 
mmn can be translated into a Japanese word 
sense of a deverbal noun. 
(2) The verbalization ofan English word 
sense in a deverbal noun and the 
verbalization of the corresponding Japanese 
equivalent can represent the same meaning. 
4.2 Type-1 DS 
Taking advantage of these parallels, the 
translation of a type-1 DS can be achieved by 
verbalizing the core Japanese translation of the 
deverbal noun in a translation lexicon. 
As we can see from the table in \[Live\], type-I 
DS's are predominant. This justifies the use of 
type-1 as the default translation of unknown 
DS's. 
As most of this type can be used passively, 
and since deverbal nouns of this type are some- 
times modified by adjectives and possessive 
pronouns, the translation mechanism should 
also allow the same degree of flexibility. 
4.3 Type-2 DS 
This type can be translated iu approximately 
the same way as type-l. However, one differ- 
ence is that this type verbalizes the peripheral 
Japanese translation i the lexicon. Since insuf- 
ficient knowledge has been accrued on what 
makes the DS select he peripheral meaning, the 
collocation of DV's and deverbal nouns should 
be specified in a lexicon. As this type also per- 
mits some modification and allows passive 
transfommtion, it should be translated by syn- 
thetic approach. 
4.4 Idiomatic DS translation 
This type does not verbalize any translation 
of the deverbal noun and is "frozen" in that the 
deverbal nouns are rarely modified by adjectives 
and the DS does not allow passive transforma- 
tion. This type of DS must be listed in a lexicon 
in its full form with a proper translation. The 
implied definition of an idiomatic DS here is (1) 
it does not represent any word sense of individ- 
ual components and (2) it resists any form of 
transformation. 
5 Passivization rules 
Some DS's can be substituted with a match- 
ing passive verb as shown in \[Live\], so that 
"take comfort" and "take counsel" can be para- 
phrased as "be comt'orted" and "be counseled," 
respectively. Though the number of such cases 
does not seem to be large, it is important to 
translate them passively, otherwise the meaning 
of the translation is totally reversed. Most DS's 
which can be substituted by passive verbs 
should be translated in a passive sense in Japa- 
nese because of the parallels between the two 
languages. "Take comfort" and "take counsel" 
should thus be translated "nagusame rareru" and 
"jyogen wo sareru." 
In this section, some rules tot passivizafion 
arc obtained by analyzing the \[Live\] table. 
Conditions for these rules will be sought in the 
syntactic and semantic haracteristics of botb 
the DV and the deverbal noun. 
Table 1 is extracted from the table in \[Live\] 
listing the combinations requiring passive sub- 
stitution. 
5.1 Condition for DV 
"Take" and "have" have about 10 passive 
verb substitutable DS's, whereas "make" and 
"give" have only one. This suggests that condi- 
tions depend on the contrasting characteristics 
ACRES DE COLING-92. NANTES, 23-28 AO~r 1992 5 6 9 PROC. oI~ COLING-92, NANTES, AUO. 23-28, 1992 
of "take," "have" and "make," "give." "Take" 
and "have" have a common characteristic: the 
action moves from the object to the subject. 
With "make" and "give," on the other hand, 
the action moves from the subject o the object. 
The characteristics of the take-have type 
seems to be the DV condition. Actually, we can 
see some hyponyms of take-have type forming 
passive verb substitutable DS's: 
I received encouragement from my 
friends. -~> I was encouraged by my 
fiiends.

5.2 Conditions for deverbal nouns 
To consider the conditions for a deverbal 
noun, formula (1) has been elaborated on to in- 
clude a subject. 
Sub + DVr + (det) + NV (2) 
Sub: Subject 
DVr: Delexical verb requir ing 
passive substitution (take, have) 
1 Constraints on deverbal nouns uch as the deter- 
miner and the number are omitted. 
As the deverbal nouns in Table 1 are derived 
from transitive verbs, we can picture a subject + 
verb + object structure for them. 
X + Vt + Y (3) 
X: Subject 
Vt: Original Transit ive Verb of the 
NV 
Y: Object 
Passive verb substitution occurs when the 
Sub in (2) agrees with Y in (3). 
He  gave advice. He took advice. 
A ~ . . . . .  
X advised Y X advised Y 
Figure 5 Agreement  between Y and Sub 
The conditions which make Y in (3) agree 
with Sub in (2) can be found in the syntactic and 
semantic haracteristics of the verb Vt. 
"Transitive" is one of the conditions men- 
tioned previously. This is not, however, suffi- 
cient as some transitive verb derivative nouns do 
not require passive verb substitution. 
Some examples are shown in the table 2. 
Table 2 Combinations which constitute 
active verb substitutable DS's \[Live\] t 
DV's take 
approach, average, bet, command, count, 
dare, dislike, etc. 
DV's have 
approach, array, battle, bet, catch, change, 
claim, command, debate, desire, dislike, 
display, dispute, doubt, dread, etc. 
The deverbal nouns in Table 1 are a confined 
subset of Table 2. A common structure seen in 
the verbs in Table 1 is: 
X<HUMAN> + Vt + Y<HUMAN> (4) 
<>: Semantic Categorization 
while many verbs in Table 2 allow both 
<HUMAN> and < INANIMATE > in the object 
slot. Furthermore, the verbs in Table 1 expect 
some change or action in the object <HUMAN> 
while the verbs in Table 2 do not. The expected 
change or action is up to the will of the object 
<HUMAN>. 
X<HUMAN> + Vt + Y<HUMAN> --> 
action, change (5) 
Verbs of  this kind generally mean "demand," 
"request," "order," and "permission" which have 
often been studied as "perlocutionary acts." In 
fact, we found that some nouns derived from 
verbs in the "per locut ionary act" group 
AcrEs DE COLING-92. NANTES. 23-28 Ao~q" 1992 5 7 0 PROC. ol: COLING-92. NANTES. AOO. 23-28. 1992 
\[Yamanashi\] formed passive verb substitutable 
DS's. 
exempt 
Ted had an exemption from military service 
because of his poor health. 
=> Ted was exempted fl'om... 
permit  
Did you have permission to enter the presi- 
dent's room? 
=> Were you permitted to enter the presP 
dent's room? 
Wal'n 
Overwork apparently lmstened his death, 
because he continued to work hard, although e 
had had warning of his illness. 
=> ...had been warned... 
\[Kizuka\] 
Formula (5) has some variations. When the 
subject slot is identical to the object slot, the 
verb becomes reflexive, thus the interpretation 
of (5) is: the subject expects him/herself to be 
affected by the action of the verb. 
obligate 
1 have an obligation to suhinit a report to the 
company once a week. 
=> I obligate myself to submit a ...2 
=> I am obliged to submit a ... 
blame 
The coach took the blame for the poor per- 
formance of his team and resigned. 
=> The coacb blamed himself for the... 
=> The coach was blamed lor the... 
\[Kizuka\] 
The variation even allows replacement of 
<HUMAN> in (5) with <INANIMATE>, which 
should be regzu'ded as a metaphoric variation of 
(5). For example, "take shape" is classified as a 
passive verb substitutable DS, 3 thus: 
My idea took shape. => My idea was shaped. 
The variation of(5) can be seen in the follow- 
ing: 
X<I tUMAN,  INANIMATE> shaped my 
idea < INANIMATE> --> action, change 
In summary, the deverbal noun conditions 
concerning passive verb substitutable DS's are: 
(1) deverbal nouns are derived from 
transitive verbs, 
(2) verbs take human subjects and objects, 
and 
(3) objects are expected to cbange as the 
2 This is not imtural but is used to reveal the underlying 
relationship. 
3 The authors think "The idea shaped up" is also another 
possible paraphrase. Here we followed the table in \[Livel 
result of the action implied by the verb. 
Condit ion (3) can be discussed from the 
viewpoint of transitivity. Since the effect on the 
object is strong, strong transit iv i ty occurs 
\[Ikegami\]. However, the result of the effect is 
not always certain and is up to the will of the 
object <HUMAN>. 
6 Implementation 
DS translat ion mechan isms were imple- 
nlented in an English to Japanese machine trans- 
lation system \[Aizawa\]\[Tanaka\] b sed on the 
discussions in sections 4 and 5. 
This mechanism works after the parser has 
fixed the "verb + object" relationship between 
the I)V and the deverbal noun. The new transla- 
tion selection mechanism was implemented by 
adding some leatures to the existing translation 
selection mechanism through the use of seman- 
tic markers. 
(1) Idiomatic DS 
An idiomatic DS is listed in the translation 
lexicou as it is with its Japanese translation. 
(2) Type-2 DS 
Among translations of a deverbal noun, if a 
peripheral translation is selected by a certain 
DV, the type-2 marker and the co-occuring DV 
are specified in the marker field of the transla- 
tion. Tbe translation will be verbalized when the 
deverbal noun coooccurs with the DV specified 
in the marker field. 
(3) Type- 1 DS 
For all deverbal nouns, the core translation 
will be given a type-1 marker. When a DS does 
not clloose an idiomatic DS or a type-2 DS, the 
translation witb a type-1 marker will be verbaP 
ized. 
An exmnple of type- 1 and type-2 markers are 
shown in figure 6. The two translations of "ex- 
ception" can be properly chosen by the descrip- 
tion. 
(4) Passivization ile 
The translation of a deverbal noun which sat- 
isfies the three conditions mentioned in section 
5 requires a passivization marker in addition to a 
type-I or type-2 marker. When they co-occur 
with either "have" or "take," the translation will 
be verbalized in the passive voice. 
(5) Verbalization 
Most of the Japanese translations of English 
deverbal nouns are so called "sahen-meishi." 
Verbalization is done by simply adding "wo 
suru" to the tail for the active sense and "wo 
sareru" for the passive sense. This is realized

7 Translation Experiment 
The DS's contained in the AP texts were 
translated using this mechanism. Two dictionar- 
ies were compiled to test the effects of the 
mechanism. In one of the dictionaries, neces- 
sary markers were ascribed to 302 deverbal 
nouns - appearing in \[Live\] - and 4 DV's (take, 
make, have, give ). The other dictionary had no 
such modifications. 
All the March 1991 AP texts which contained 
both the DV's and the deverbal nouns mentioned 
above were selected by a simple filtering of the 
text. The filtered text was translated using the 
two dictionaries and the results were compared 
by human assessment. Sentences not having a 
"verb - object" relationship between the DV and 
deverbal noun were rejected. The results are 
shown in Table 4.

Translations without the DS translation 
mechanism produced the origiual word sense of 
the DV, resulting in awkward translations. 
In Case 3, the DS correctly translated " take 
the lead" using "riido wo suru (go ahead of)" 
while the original system produced "namari wo 
toru (pick up a piece of the metal lead)." The 
revised mechanism thus successfully distin- 
guished the ambiguity in the word sense of 
"lead." In Case 4, the passive verb substitutable 
DS "took some encouragement," in which the 
deverbal noun is modified by "some," was suc- 
cessfully translated passively into Japanese. 
In the example which was made worse, "give 
an impression" was translated into "inshou wo 
shite," which is worse than "inshou wo ataete." 
This is due to the simple verbalization mecha- 
nism which attaches "suru" to all nouns backed 
up by heuristics. The transitive verb form of the 
Japanese word "inshou (impression)" is "inshou 
zukeru." Further elaboration of the verbalization 
mechanism, such as the use of a noun/verb con- 
version table, will solve this problem. 
The quality of the translation was improved 
remarkably, though the translation mechanism 
was quite simple. 
8 Conclusions 
A method has been proposed for translating 
English delexical verb structures into Japanese. 
Since this method involves rule-based syn- 
thesis, transformed and modified DS's were 
flexibly translated. The conditions which re- 
quire a DS "passive verb substitution" were fac- 
tored out and included in the translation rule. 
The feasibility of this method was tested by 
translating AP news texts, which sbowed a re- 
markable improvement in the quality of transla- 
tion, with a correct rate of nearly 100%. 
To achieve better esults, precise verbaliza- 
tions of Japanese nouns are required, though a 
simpler method worked well due to the ability to 
express many "verbal nouns" as "sahen-meishi" 
in Japanese. 
A voice control rule was developed based on 
the "flow of action" of delexical verbs and the 
"transitivity" of deverbal nouns (the original 
verb). Other delexical verbs such as, "put," 
"cast," receive," etc, can also be categorized by 
"flow of action" and can be integrated into tbe 
same framework to cover a wider range of DS 
translations. 
The role of the other DS components, ar- 
ticles, possessive pronouns, and prepositions 
should also be explored. 
The differences between "make" and "give," 
and "take" and "have" has been neglected in this 
rule. However the differences between "take" 
and "have" in certain contexts have been pointed 
out by \[Wierzbicka\]. It would be interesting to 
explore these differences in the context of trans- 
lation.
