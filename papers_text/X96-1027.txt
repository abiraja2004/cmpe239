Projects currently underway at Sheffield may be 
more appropriately described by the term Language 
Engineering than the well-established labels of Nat- 
ural Language Processing or Computational Linguis- 
tics. This reflects an increased focus on viable ap- 
plications of language technology, promoting a view 
of the software infrastructure ascentral to the devel- 
opment process. To this end, Sheffield has produced 
GATE - a TIPSTER-compatible General Architec- 
ture for Text Engineering - providing an environment 
in which a number of Sheffield projects are currently 
being developed. 
GATE 
GATE is an architecture in the sense that it provides 
a common infrastructure for building language ngi- 
neering (LE) systems. It is also a development envi- 
ronment that provides aids for the construction, test- 
ing and evaluation of LE systems (and particularly 
for the reuse of existing components in new systems). 
GATE presents researchers and developers with 
an environment in which they can easily use linguis- 
tic tools and databases from a user-friendly interface. 
Different processes, such as tagging or parsing, can 
be applied to documents or collections and the re- 
sults compared and analysed. System modules, or 
combinations of modules which form complete sys- 
tems, e.g. IE, IR or MT systems, can be config- 
ured and evaluated (e.g. using the Parseval tools), 
then reconfigured and reevaluated, providing a kind 
of edit/compile/test cycle for LE components. 
GATE comprises three principal elements: 
? the GATE Document Manager (GDM) - -  a 
TIPSTER-compatible database for storing in- 
formation about texts; 
? the GATE Graphical Interface (GGI) - -  an in- 
terface for launching processing tools on data 
and viewing and evaluating the results; 
? a Collection of Reusable Objects for Language 
Engineering (CREOLE) - -  a collection of wrap- 
pers for algorithmic and data resources that in- 
teroperate with the database and interface. 
GDM 
GDM is based on the TIPSTER document manager. 
It provides a central repository or server that stores 
all the information an LE system generates about he 
texts it processes. All communication between the 
system components goes through GDM, thereby insu- 
lating parts from each other and providing a uniform 
API (applications programmer interface) for manip- 
ulating the data produced by the system. 1 Benefits of 
this approach include the ability to exploit he matu- 
rity and efficiency of database t chnology, easy mod- 
elling of blackboard-type distributed control regimes 
(of the type proposed by \[2\]), and reduced interde- 
pendence of components. 
GGI  
GGI is a graphical aunchpad for LE subsystems, 
and provides various facilities for testing and view- 
ing results, and interactively assembling LE compo- 
nents into different system configurations. As we 
built Sheffield's MUC-6 entry, LaSIE \[6\], it was of- 
ten the case that we were unsure of the implications 
for system performance ofusing tagger X instead of 
tagger Y, or gazetteer A instead of pattern matcher 
B. In the GGI interface, substitution of components 
is a point-and-click operation. This facility supports 
hybrid systems, ease of upgrading and open systems- 
style module interchangeability. 2 
Figure 1 shows the launchpad for a MUC-6 IE 
system. Colours are used to indicate the status of 
each component with respect o the current docu- 
ment/collection: dark (red) components have already 
been run and their results are available for viewing; 
light (green) components have all their required in- 
puts available and are ready to run, and grey (amber) 
components require a currently unavailable input be- 
fore they can become runnable. 
IWhere very large data sets need passing between modules, other external databases can be employed if necessary. 
2Note that delivered systems can use GDM and CREOLE without GGI.

CREOLE 
In a GATE-based system, the real work of process- 
ing texts - analysis, summarisation, translation, etc. 
- is done by CREOLE modules. Note that we use 
the terms module and object rather loosely to mean 
interfaces to resources which may be predominantly 
algorithmic or predominantly data, or a mixture of 
both. We exploit object-orientation for reasons of 
modularity, coupling and cohesion, fluency of mod- 
elling and ease of reuse (see e.g. \[3\]). 
A CREOLE object may be a wrapper around a 
pre-existing LE module or database (e.g. a tagger or 
parser, a lexicon or n-gram index), or may be de- 
veloped from scratch to conform to the T IPSTER 
architecture. In either case, the object provides a 
standardised API to the underlying resources, with 
access via GGI and I /O via GDM. 
MULTEXT compatibility 
MULTEXT \[9, 5, 1\] was an EU project to produce 
tools for multilingual corpus annotation and sam- 
ple corpora marked-up according to the same stan- 
dards used to drive the tool development. Annota- 
tion tools currently developed perform text segmen- 
tation, POS tagging, morphological nalysis and par- 
allel text alignment. The project has defined an ar- 
chitecture centred on a model of the data passed be- 
tween the various phases of processing implemented 
by the tools. The MULTEXT architecture is based 
on a commitment to TEI-style \[8\] SGML \[7\] encoding 
of information about text. The TEI defines tandard 
tag sets for a range of purposes including many rel- 
evant to LE systems. Tools in a MULTEXT system 
communicate via interfaces pecified as SGML doc- 
ument type definitions (DTDs - essentially tag set 
descriptions). 
The MULTEXT tools are currently in use and 
are recommended by the EU. GATE plans to sup- 
port conversions between T IPSTER annotations and 
MULTEXT SGML markup, allowing data produced 
by the TIPSTER-compliant CREOLE modules to be 
written out in SGML for processing by MULTEXT 
tools, and the SGML results then converted back into 
native format. The extensive work done on SGML 
processing in MULTEXT could usefully fill a gap in 
the current T IPSTER model, in which SGML capa- 
bility is not fully specified. Integration of the results 
of both projects would seem to be the best of both 
worlds, and we hope to achieve this in GATE. 
TIPSTER in EU Projects 
The Sheffield NLP group is moving all its research 
and development work to GATE, and therefore to 
the T IPSTER architecture. Several pan-European 
projects are involved, including: 
? AVENTINUS - a research and development 
programme set up to build a multilingual in- 
formation extraction system for multinational 
drug enforcement; 
122 
with 
? ECRAN - a language engineering research 
project designed to offer filtered access to mul- 
tilingual textual information delivered via TV 
screen or personal computer; 
collaborators such as: 
Thompson-CSF, Paris, France; 
Intelligent Financial Systems, Berlin, Germany; 
ILSP, Athens, Greece; 
GMS, Munich, Germany (formerly Siemens Si- 
etec); 
? four European drug enforcement agencies and 
Europol; 
* The Universities of Fribourg, Germany; 
Gothenburg, Sweden; Ancona, Italy.

Working with GATE, the researcher will from the 
outset reuse existing components, the overhead for 
doing so being much lower than is conventionally the \[3\] 
case - instead of learning new methods for each mod- 
ule reused, the common APIs of GDM and CREOLE 
mean that only one integration mechanism ust be \[4\] 
learned. And as increasing numbers of CREOLE 
modules and databases become available, through 
collaboration with sites able to provide single LE 
components, e.g. from the MULTEXT tools, we ex- 
pect GATE, and therefore the TIPSTER architec- \[5\] 
ture, to become widely used in the LE research com- 
munity. 
Availabil ity of GATE 
GATE is freely available for research purposes. The 
initial release is delivered with a CREOLE set com- 
prising a complete MUC-compatible IE system called 
VIE - a Vanilla IE system. Some of the objects in 
VIE are freely available software (e.g. the Brill part- 
of-speech tagger \[4\]), while others are derived from 
Sheffield's MUC-6 entry, LaSIE \[6\].
