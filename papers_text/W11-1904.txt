Abstract
This paper presents Illinois-Coref, a system
for coreference resolution that participated
in the CoNLL-2011 shared task. We in-
vestigate two inference methods, Best-Link
and All-Link, along with their corresponding,
pairwise and structured, learning protocols.
Within these, we provide a flexible architec-
ture for incorporating linguistically-motivated
constraints, several of which we developed
and integrated. We compare and evaluate the
inference approaches and the contribution of
constraints, analyze the mistakes of the sys-
tem, and discuss the challenges of resolving
coreference for the OntoNotes-4.0 data set.
1 Introduction
The coreference resolution task is challenging, re-
quiring a human or automated reader to identify
denotative phrases (?mentions?) and link them to
an underlying set of referents. Human readers use
syntactic and semantic cues to identify and dis-
ambiguate the referring phrases; a successful auto-
mated system must replicate this behavior by linking
mentions that refer to the same underlying entity.
This paper describes Illinois-Coref, a corefer-
ence resolution system built on Learning Based
Java (Rizzolo and Roth, 2010), that participated
in the ?closed? track of the CoNLL-2011 shared
task (Pradhan et al, 2011). Building on elements
of the coreference system described in Bengtson
and Roth (2008), we design an end-to-end system
(Sec. 2) that identifies candidate mentions and then
applies one of two inference protocols, Best-Link
and All-Link (Sec. 2.3), to disambiguate and clus-
ter them. These protocols were designed to easily
incorporate domain knowledge in the form of con-
straints. In Sec. 2.4, we describe the constraints that
we develop and incorporate into the system. The
different strategies for mention detection and infer-
ence, and the integration of constraints are evaluated
in Sections 3 and 4.
2 Architecture
Illinois-Coref follows the architecture used in
Bengtson and Roth (2008). First, candidate men-
tions are detected (Sec. 2.1). Next, a pairwise
classifier is applied to each pair of mentions, gen-
erating a score that indicates their compatibility
(Sec. 2.2). Next, at inference stage, a coreference
decoder (Sec. 2.3) aggregates these scores into men-
tion clusters. The original system uses the Best-Link
approach; we also experiment with All-Link decod-
ing. This flexible decoder architecture allows lin-
guistic or knowledge-based constraints to be easily
added to the system: constraints may force mentions
to be coreferent or non-coreferent and can be option-
ally used in either of the inference protocols. We
designed and implemented several such constraints
(Sec. 2.4). Finally, since mentions that are in single-
ton clusters are not annotated in the OntoNotes-4.0
data set, we remove those as a post-processing step.
2.1 Mention Detection
Given a document, a mention detector generates a
set of mention candidates that are used by the subse-
quent components of the system. A robust mention
detector is crucial, as detection errors will propagate
to the coreference stage. As we show in Sec. 3, the
system that uses gold mentions outperforms the sys-
tem that uses predicted mentions by a large margin,
from 15% to 18% absolute difference.
40
For the ACE 2004 coreference task, a good per-
formance in mention detection is typically achieved
by training a classifier e.g., (Bengtson and Roth,
2008). However, this model is not appropriate for
the OntoNotes-4.0 data set, in which (in contrast to
the ACE 2004 corpus) singleton mentions are not
annotated: a specific noun phrase (NP) may corre-
spond to a mention in one document but will not
be a mention in another document. Therefore, we
designed a high recall (? 90%) and low precision
(? 35%) rule-based mention detection system that
includes all phrases recognized as Named Entities
(NE?s) and all phrases tagged as NPs in the syntac-
tic parse of the text. As a post-processing step, we
remove all predicted mentions that remain in single-
ton clusters after the inference stage.
The best mention detection result on the DEV set1
is 64.93% in F1 score (after coreference resolution)
and is achieved by our best inference protocol, Best-
Link with constraints.
2.2 Pairwise Mention Scoring
The basic input to our inference algorithm is a pair-
wise mention score, which indicates the compatibil-
ity score of a pair of mentions. For any two mentions
u and v, the compatibility score wuv is produced
by a pairwise scoring component that uses extracted
features ?(u, v) and linguistic constraints c:
wuv = w ? ?(u, v) + c(u, v) + t, (1)
where w is a weight vector learned from training
data, c(u, v) is a compatibility score given by the
constraints, and t is a threshold parameter (to be
tuned). We use the same features as Bengtson and
Roth (2008), with the knowledge extracted from the
OntoNotes-4.0 annotation. The exact use of the
scores and the procedure for learning weights w are
specific to the inference algorithm and are described
next.
2.3 Inference
In this section, we present our inference techniques
for coreference resolution. These clustering tech-
niques take as input a set of pairwise mention scores
over a document and aggregate them into globally
1In the shared task, the data set is split into three sets:
TRAIN, DEV, and TEST.
consistent cliques representing entities. We investi-
gate the traditional Best-Link approach and a more
intuitively appealing All-Link algorithm.
2.3.1 Best-Link
Best-Link is a popular approach to coreference
resolution. For each mention, it considers the best
mention on its left to connect to (best according
the pairwise score wuv) and creates a link between
them if the pairwise score is above some thresh-
old. Although its strategy is simple, Bengtson and
Roth (2008) show that with a careful design, it can
achieve highly competitive performance.
Inference: We give an integer linear programming
(ILP) formulation of Best-Link inference in order to
present both of our inference algorithms within the
same framework. Given a pairwise scorer w, we
can compute the compatibility scores ? wuv from
Eq. (1) ? for all mention pairs u and v. Let yuv be
a binary variable, such that yuv = 1 only if u and v
are in the same cluster. For a document d, Best-Link
solves the following ILP formulation:
argmaxy
?
u,v
wuvyuv
s.t
?
u<v
yuv ? 1 ?v,
yuw ? {0, 1}.
(2)
Eq. (2) generates a set of connected components and
all the mentions in each connected component con-
stitute an entity.
Learning: We follow the strategy in (Bengtson
and Roth, 2008, Section 2.2) to learn the pairwise
scoring function w. The scoring function is trained
on:
? Positive examples: for each mention u, we con-
struct a positive example (u, v), where v is the
closest preceding mention in u?s equivalence
class.
? Negative examples: all mention pairs (u, v),
where v is a preceding mention of u and u, v
are not in the same class.
As a result of the singleton mentions not being anno-
tated, there is an inconsistency in the sample distri-
butions in the training and inference phases. There-
fore, we apply the mention detector to the training
set, and train the classifier using the union set of gold
and predicted mentions.

2.3.2 All-Link
The All-Link inference approach scores a cluster-
ing of mentions by including all possible pairwise
links in the score. It is also known as correlational
clustering (Bansal et al, 2002) and has been applied
to coreference resolution in the form of supervised
clustering (Mccallum and Wellner, 2003; Finley and
Joachims, 2005).
Inference: Similar to Best-Link, for a document d,
All-Link inference finds a clustering All-Link(d;w)
by solving the following ILP problem:
argmaxy
?
u,v
wuvyuv
s.t yuw ? yuv + yvw ? 1 ?u,w, v,
yuw ? {0, 1}.
(3)
The inequality constraints in Eq. (3) enforce the
transitive closure of the clustering. The solution of
Eq. (3) is a set of cliques, and the mentions in the
same cliques corefer.
Learning: We present a structured perceptron al-
gorithm, which is similar to supervised clustering
algorithm (Finley and Joachims, 2005) to learn w.
Note that as an approximation, it is certainly pos-
sible to use the weight parameter learned by using,
say, averaged perceptron over positive and negative
links. The pseudocode is presented in Algorithm 1.

For the All-Link clustering, we drop one of the
three transitivity constraints for each triple of men-
tion variables. Similar to Pascal and Baldridge
(2009), we observe that this improves accuracy ?

for more details.
2.4 Constraints
The constraints in our inference algorithm are based
on the analysis of mistakes on the DEV set2. Since
the majority of errors are mistakes in recall, where
the system fails to link mentions that refer to the
same entity, we define three high precision con-
straints that improve recall on NPs with definite de-
terminers and mentions whose heads are NE?s.
The patterns used by constraints to match mention
pairs have some overlap with those used by the pair-
wise mention scorer, but their formulation as con-
straints allow us to focus on a subset of mentions
to which a certain pattern applies with high preci-
sion. For example, the constraints use a rule-based
string similarity measure that accounts for the in-
ferred semantic type of the mentions compared. Ex-
amples of mention pairs that are correctly linked by
the constraints are: Governor Bush? Bush; a cru-
cial swing state , Florida? Florida; Sony itself ?
Sony; Farmers? Los Angeles - based Farmers.
3 Experiments and Results
In this section, we present the performance of the
system on the OntoNotes-4.0 data set. A previous
experiment using an earlier version of this data can
be found in (Pradhan et al, 2007). Table 1 shows the
performance for the two inference protocols, with
and without constraints. Best-Link outperforms All-
Link for both predicted and gold mentions. Adding
constraints improves the performance slightly for
Best-Link on predicted mentions. In the other con-
figurations, the constraints either do not affect the
performance or slightly degrade it.
Table 2 shows the results obtained on TEST, using
the best system configurations found on DEV. We
report results on predicted mentions with predicted
boundaries, predicted mentions with gold bound-
aries, and when using gold mentions3.
2We provide a more detailed analysis of the errors in Sec. 4.
3Note that the gold boundaries results are different from the
gold mention results. Specifying gold mentions requires coref-
erence resolution to exclude singleton mentions. Gold bound-
aries are provided by the task organizers and also include sin-
gleton mentions.

4 Discussion
Most of the mistakes made by the system are due to
not linking co-referring mentions. The constraints
improve slightly the recall on a subset of mentions,
and here we show other common errors for the sys-
tem. For instance, the system fails to link the two
mentions, the Emory University hospital in Atlanta
and the hospital behind me, since each of the men-
tions has a modifier that is not part of the other men-
tion. Another common error is related to pronoun
resolution, especially when a pronoun has several
antecedents in the immediate context, appropriate in
gender, number, and animacy, as in ? E. Robert Wal-
lach was sentenced by a U.S. judge in New York to
six years in prison and fined $ 250,000 for his rack-
eteering conviction in the Wedtech scandal .?: both
E. Robert Wallach and a U.S. judge are appropri-
ate antecedents for the pronoun his. Pronoun errors
are especially important to address since 35% of the
mentions are pronouns.
The system also incorrectly links some mentions,
such as: ?The suspect said it took months to repack-
age...? (?it? cannot refer to a human); ?They see
them.? (subject and object in the same sentence are
linked); and ?Many freeway accidents occur simply
because people stay inside the car and sort out...?
(the NP the car should not be linked to any other
mention, since it does not refer to a specific entity).
5 Conclusions
We have investigated a coreference resolution sys-
tem that uses a rich set of features and two popular
types of clustering algorithm.
While the All-Link clustering seems to be capable
of taking more information into account for making
clustering decisions, as it requires each mention in
a cluster to be compatible with all other mentions in
that cluster, the Best-Link approach still outperforms
it. This raises a natural algorithmic question regard-
ing the inherent nature of clustering style most suit-
able for coreference and regarding possible ways of
infusing more knowledge into different coreference
clustering styles. Our approach accommodates in-
fusion of knowledge via constraints, and we have
demonstrated its utility in an end-to-end coreference
system.
