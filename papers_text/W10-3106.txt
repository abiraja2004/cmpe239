Abstract 
 
One emergent field in text mining tools ap-
plied to biological texts is the automatic de-
tection of speculative sentences. In this pa-
per, we test on a large scale BioExcom, a 
rule-based system which annotates and ca-
tegorizes automatically speculative sen-
tences (?prior? and ?new?). This work 
enables us to highlight a more restrictive 
way to consider speculations, viewed as a 
source of knowledge, and to discuss the cri-
teria used to determine if a sentence is spe-
culative or not. By doing so, we demonstrate 
the efficiency of BioExcom to extract these 
types of speculations and we argue the im-
portance of this tool for biologists, who are 
also interested in finding hypotheses. 
1 Introduction 
In one of the first studies about biological 
speculations in Natural Language Processing, 
Light et al (2004) have reported that biologists 
can have a dual posture concerning this sub-
ject: 
 
?In the context of information retrieval, an ex-
ample information need might be ?I am looking 
for speculations about the X gene in liver tis-
sue.? One of the authors spoke at a research 
department of a drug company and the biolo-
gists present expressed this sort of information 
need. On the other hand, one of the authors has 
also encountered the opposite need: ?I am look-
ing for definite statements about transcription 
factors that interact with NF Kappa B.? Both 
these information needs would be easier to ful-
fill if automated annotation of speculative pas-
sages was possible.? (Light et al, 2004) 
 
 In this quotation, the term ?speculation? has 
not exactly the same meaning in these two 
statements (depending if it comes from compu-
tational linguists or from biologists). Indeed, 
because biologists are almost interested in 
knowing only factual statements, the informa-
tion extraction tools have to remove all uncer-
tain statements, identified as hedging or specu-
lation, or at least to present them separately 
from definite results. Consequently, the vast 
majority of Natural Language Processing tools 
dealing with the identification of speculation 
have followed this very large meaning of the 
word ?speculation?, in order to avoid extract-
ing uncertain information as factual informa-
tion (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008; Medlock, 
2008; Szarvas, 2008; Morante and Daelemans, 
2009; ?zgur and Radev, 2009). To help im-
prove the information extraction tools, a cor-
pus, called BioScope, has been annotated for 
speculation, negation and its linguistic scopes 
in biomedical texts (Szarvas et al, 2008). 
 However, when a biologist says he is inter-
ested in knowing all speculations about a bio-
logical entity (gene or protein for example) or 
a biological process, this claim concerns 
another meaning of the word ?speculation?. 
The latter is in this case more restrictive than 
previously, and close to the notion of hypothe-
sis and uncertain proposal. This interest of bi-
ologists can be explained by different reasons. 
Firstly, since speculations give meaning to re-
sults, they sometimes carry more useful infor-
mation than factual sentences. In addition, spe-
culative sentences emphasize important data, 
which can be very useful in data-collection 
papers (genomic and post-genomic papers, see 
(Brent and Lok, 2005)). Finally, speculations 
can also give current trends or directions, by 
enabling the researchers to anticipate future 
experimental discoveries, or by suggesting 
other ways to envision biological problems and 
giving new ideas for future experiments (Bla-
gosklonny and Pardee, 2002). Hence, despite 
its importance for biologists, the need to find 
speculation according to this view has been 
neglected until now in Natural Language 
32
Processing. To our knowledge, the only work 
focusing specifically on this issue is the devel-
opment of the rule-based system BioExcom 
(Descl?s et al, 2009). Since BioExcom has 
obtained good results for detecting specula-
tions but in a relatively small scale evaluation, 
it seems useful to test this tool on a large, un-
known corpus like BioScope. Furthermore, it is 
important to compare in greater detail these 
two different approaches to characterize spe-
culative sentences and see more precisely in 
what they differ.  
 We performed an automatic annotation of 
the BioScope corpus by BioExcom and we 
measured raw performance. We observed that 
the vast majority of the divergences between 
BioExcom results and BioScope were due to 
the criteria used for detecting a speculative 
sentence. We manually treated the diverging 
sentences in order to correctly evaluate BioEx-
com according to its own criteria.  
The contributions of this paper are the fol-
lowing: 
? We present an original approach for consi-
dering speculative sentences in bio text min-
ing. It concerns the definition of a specula-
tion, the criteria used to find it and its im-
portance for biologists. 
? We demonstrate the efficiency of BioEx-
com to recognize these statements on a 
large-scale evaluation with good results. 
? According to this new approach we pro-
vide an annotated corpus freely available in 
order to be used by researchers.  
2 Related work 
Hyland (1995) has extensively studied hedg-
ing, from a linguistic perspective, (the term of 
hedging has been introduced by Lakoff (1972)) 
in biological papers. Hedging represents an 
absence of certainty and is employed to 
indicate either a lack of commitment to the 
truth value of an accompanying proposition; 
either a desire not to express that commitment 
categorically. Three main functions are 
outlined for hedging: weakening the strength 
of a statement, signalling uncertainty and 
expressing deference to the reader. 
 From a Natural Language Processing pers-
pective, the first work was carried out by Light 
et al (2004). After a linguistic study of the use 
of speculative language in MEDLINE ab-
stracts, the authors tested the possibility of ma-
nually annotating the speculative sentences by 
experts and linguists whilst providing small 
annotation guidelines. They concluded that 
humans can reliably annotate speculative sen-
tences but that it is not possible to distinguish 
between ?high? speculations and ?low? specu-
lations. Furthermore they performed an expe-
riment with different automated methods based 
principally on the retrieval of keywords. Wil-
bur et al (2006) defined five qualitative di-
mensions for scientific text annotations. Two 
of them concerned speculative statements (cer-
tainty and evidence) and they defined various 
guidelines for annotating text using them. 
 Medlock and Briscone (2007) provided 
much more detailed guidelines for hedge de-
tection. A linguist and a domain expert without 
any input into the guideline development 
process, labelled a publicly available dataset 
(FlyBase dataset, consisting of 6 papers on 
Drosophila melanogaster) in order to perform 
a probabilistic acquisition model and to test it. 
A separation of the acquisition and classifica-
tion phases in semi-supervised machine learn-
ing was used.  
 Svarzas (2008) managed to devise a hedge 
classification in biomedical texts based on a 
weakly supervised selection of keywords. To 
evaluate their system, they manually annotated 
four papers of BMC Bioinformatics with the 
same criteria as Medlock and Briscone (2007). 
They obtained an F-Measure of 85% on the 
FlyBase dataset and an F-Measure of 75% on 
the BMC Bioinformatics dataset, when the 
training was carried out with the FlyBase data-
set, demonstrating that the probability of their 
hedge classifiers is limited.  
 To recognize speculative sentences, Kili-
coglu and Bergler (2008) also used speculative 
keywords from prior linguistic work and ex-
panded them by WordNet, UMLS Specialist 
Lexicon, and by introducing syntactic patterns. 
In order to determine the speculative strength 
of sentences, they assigned speculative cues to 
weights in two methods. They worked on the 
two publicly available corpora, obtaining an F-
Measure of 85% on the FlyBase data set and 
an F-Measure of 82% on the BMC Bioinfor-
matics data. 
 The BioScope corpus is a manually anno-
tated corpus for speculation and negation key-
words (token level), and their linguistic scopes 
(sentence level) (Szarvas et al, 2008). This 
corpus is publicly available1 and the annotation

process has been performed by two indepen-
dent annotators and a chief linguist. In particu-
lar, the corpus consists of 9 full texts papers 
(five papers from the FlyBase dataset and four 
papers from the journal BMC Bioinformatics), 
and 1273 abstracts (from the Genia Corpus 
(Collier et al, 1999)). The annotation guide-
lines are provided and speculation is identified 
to uncertainty and hedging. However the crite-
ria used here are not detailed very accurately, 
unlike the detailed work of Medlock and Bris-
cone (2007).    
 In order to detect hedging but also their 
scope, two recent works were recently 
published. Morante and Daelemans (2009) 
present a machine learning system based on a 
previous system used to detect the scope of 
negation cues. Thus they show that the same 
scope finding system can be applied to both 
negation and hedging. They used the three 
subcropora of the BioScope corpus to test the 
efficiency of their system: the best F-Measures 
they obtained were 85% on the abstracts (10-
fold cross-validation experiments), 72% on the 
Full Text Papers and 60% on the Clinical 
reports for hedge detection (training phase on 
the full abstract subcorpus). ?zgur and Radev 
(2009) built also a system that detects specula-
tions and their scopes in biomedical scientific 
texts. They performed a supervised classifica-
tion task, where they classified the potential 
keywords as real speculation keywords or not 
by using a diverse set of linguistic features that 
represent the contexts of the keywords. They 
obtained F-Measure of 92% for the scientific 
abstracts (10-fold cross-validation 
experiments). The F-Measure for Full Text 
Papers (leave-one-out-cross-validation) was 
83%. 
3 BioExcom 
EXCOM2  (Djioua et al, 2006; Alrahabi, 2010) 
is a rule-based system using the computational 
principles of the Contextual Exploration 
processing (Descl?s, 2006). EXCOM does not 
need any morpho-syntactic analysis and only 
requires one pre-treatment step of corpus seg-
mentation into segments (which are sentences 
or sometimes clauses according to the punctua-
tion) (Figure 1). EXCOM uses declarative 
rules built by linguists or domain experts and 
based on the search for linguistic markers in 
the text. The latter are hierarchically organized 
                                                 
2 http://www.excom.fr/  
into the rules: they are either indicators (strong 
markers) or clues (complementary markers). 
Only the presence of indicators in the text 
triggers the associated CE rules, and then the 
additional clues can be searched for in the 
context defined by the rules, which is in our 
case the same sentence as the indicator (Figure 
2). 
 
Figure 1: Overview of Excom processing (Alrahabi, 
2010) 
 EXCOM allows the use of already 
annotated segments as markers, and also to 
order the rules and to use ?negative? clues that 
cancel certain rules. The clues can be arranged 
between each other and versus the indicator (at 
its left, right or inside it). They are used to con-
firm, invalidate or specify an annotation car-
ried by an indicator. If all the examined 
conditions of a rule are satisfied, EXCOM 
attributes the corresponding annotation to the 
designated segment. Generally the indicators 
are interconnected into graphs called ?semantic 
maps? (Alrahabi and Descl?s, 2008). EXCOM 
has been used for various tasks such as auto-
matic summarization, relationships between 
concepts, categorization of bibliographic cita-
tions and reported speech. 
BioExcom is the system that uses the anno-
tation performed by EXCOM thanks to 
specific linguistic resources built for detecting 
speculations in biomedical papers (Descl?s et 
al., 2009). Furthermore, BioExcom performs 
an indexation of the annotated segments in or-
der to provide the possibility of searching for 
34
specific terms. The rules used for the annota-
tion processing are based on a precise semantic 
analysis of the multiple ways to express specu-
lation performed by an expert in about seventy 
biological papers. BioExcom also categorizes 
speculative segments into ?new speculation? 
(speculative sentences presented for the first 
time in the paper or not explicitly presented as 
prior speculation) and ?prior speculation? 
(speculative sentences cited in the paper, but 
presented as having been proposed previously). 
BioExcom uses thirty rules, based on twelve 
indicator classes. 
 
 
Figure 2: The contextual exploration principles: 
search for an indicator and then for some clues in a 
contextual space (a sentence or a clause in our case) 
according to some associated rules. 
 
The criteria used to find speculations are de-
scribed in detailed annotation guidelines, 
which are available on line 3 . Only the seg-
ments containing at least one linguistic element 
expressing speculation are considered. A spec-
ulation is defined as a proposal still not dem-
onstrated about a biological issue and explicit-
ly presented as uncertain in the paper. Thus, 
speculations are considered as potential 
sources of relevant information for biologists. 
Others types of statements such as deductions, 
conclusions, arguments and discussions are not 
considered as speculative but as intermediary 
statements, because they either present con-
cepts more or less certain, or they do not make 
a proposal.  
It is worth noting that contrary to other ap-
proaches, like Medlock (2008), the open ques-
tions are not speculative because they only ask 
a question about a biological problem without 
proposing a mechanism (sentence 1).

(1) How endocytosis of DI leads to the 
activation of N remains to be 
elucidated. 
In order to better illustrate what a proposal 
is and how BioExcom performs annotation we 
can compare this sentence with the example 
(2) where BioExcom finds the indicator ?is not 
known?. Nevertheless, as the goal of this tool is 
not to extract all sentences expressing 
uncertainty, BioExcom searches for the clue 
?whether? at the right or at the left of the indi-
cator. The presence of this clue indicates that, 
contrary to the sentence (1) with ?how?, the 
sentence (2) proposes a mechanism and 
consequently is a speculation.  
 
(2) Also, whether the signaling activity of 
Ser is similarly regulated by 
endocytosis is not known. 
 
The sentences which discuss a speculation 
without being informative about the content of 
the speculation are also not considered as 
speculations (sentence 3, extracted from the 
guidelines of Medlock (2008)). Indeed the goal 
of BioExcom is to detect a sentence explaining, 
at least partially, a speculation, and not to 
know, as the example (3), whether a specula-
tion is purely speculative or is supported (or 
not) by facts. For the same reason, BioExcom 
extracts speculation without taking into ac-
count whether this speculation is denied or not. 
 
(3) The rescue of the D-mib mutant    
phenotype by ectopic expression of 
Neur strongly supports this 
interpretation 
At present, the evaluation process of BioEx-
com has only been performed on a relatively 
small scale (2 full-text papers read by five ex-
perts and containing 59 speculative sentences 
in total) and after the automatic annotation 
process (Descl?s et al, 2009). Promising re-
sults have been reported for BioExcom in de-
tecting speculations, by providing a high Preci-
sion of 98,3%, and a Recall of 95,1% (F-
Measure of 96,7%). This rate is consistent with 
the goal of BioExcom to be a monitoring and 
decision support tool.

4 Raw evaluation  
The Bioscope corpus (Szarvas et al, 2008) 
consists of three parts; namely medical free 
texts, biological full papers and biological 
scientific abstracts. However in this test, we 
only used two parts of the Bioscope corpus 
(full papers and abstracts) because we were 
preferentially interested in the biomedical 
scientific domain.  
First, we cleaned the corpus from all element 
tags (angled brackets marking hedge keywords 
and parentheses marking scopes) and saved 
these documents into text files. The latter could 
then be automatically segmented into sen-
tences or clauses and semantically annotated 
by BioExcom. As a result of this processing, 
BioExcom automatically extracted 341 seg-
ments from the Full Text Papers Corpus and 
1489 segments from the Abstract Corpus (1830 
segments in total)4 . We could then compare 
our output files with the Bioscope Corpus 
which contained manual annotations. In this 
task we do not consider the categorization of 
BioExcom (?new speculation? and ?prior 
speculation?) and these annotated sentences 
are only considered as speculative. Thus, we 
obtained the results presented in Table 1. Con-
sistent with the previous evaluation performed 
on BioExcom (Descl?s et al, 2009), the Preci-
sion is high (approximately 93% in average, 
calculated from the total of segments of the 
two corpora). Nevertheless, the Recall dramat-
ically falls to approximately 68% (in average) 
compared to the first evaluation (Recall of 
93%).

4 The results of the annotation of BioScope corpus by 
BioExcom are publicly available: 
http://www.bioexcom.net/. It is worth mentioning that a 
few sentences were not segmented exactly in the same 
way by BioExcom and in the BioScope corpus 
(approximately 2% of divergences). We based all our 
calculations on BioExcom segmentation. 
(4) High conservation of residues near the 
inframe stop codon also suggests the 
importance of this region. 
(5)  Therefore, sets of genes identified from 
co-expression data may often contain 
multiple extraneous upstream 
sequences. 
(6)  To test the hypothesis that cortivazol 
acts in dex-resistant cells by making 
use of the residual GR found there, 
wild-type and dex-resistant clones 
were treated with various 
concentrations of cortivazol and the 
induction of GR mRNA was studied. 
(7) To determine whether specific mem-
bers of the NF-kappa B family contri-
bute to this effect, we examined the 
abilities of different NF-kappa B subu-
nits to act with Tat-I to stimulate 
transcription of HIV in Jurkat T-
leukemia cells. 
If we compare the speculative keywords in-
dicated in BioScope (underlined) and the 
markers used by BioExcom, we see some con-
vergences (?suggests? and ?may? for the sen-
tences (4) and (5)), but also some divergences. 
In the sentence (6), BioExcom uses ?hypothe-
sis that? as an indicator in order to extract in-
formative speculations and not only sentences 
containing the word ?hypothesis?. The exam-
ple of the sentence (7) is much more illustra-
tive for the differences: whereas only ?wheth-
er? is taken into account as a keyword in Bi-
oScope, BioExcom uses ?to determine? as an 
indicator and ?whether? as a positive clue, al-
lowing extracting only sentences containing a 
proposal (see example 2). The minimalist 
strategy (searching for the minimal unit that 
expresses speculation) followed by the annota-
tors of BioScope for the keywords can explain 
these observations.  
5 Corrected evaluation 
Our goal was to evaluate the performance of 
BioExcom according to its own definition of 
speculation. To analyze the observed low Re-
call (Table 1), we assumed that all sentences 
presenting an agreement between both me-
thods (manual annotation in BioScope and au-
tomatic annotation by BioExcom) were cor-
rectly annotated and we checked manually all 
the segments (984 segments) presenting a di-
vergence of annotation. This checking was per-
formed by a biologist as chief evaluator (writer 
36
of the annotation guidelines) and two indepen-
dent linguists, not allowed to communicate 
with each other. None of these evaluators knew 
the annotation performed by BioExcom or in 
BioScope (blind study). The conflicts were 
resolved by discussions during regular meet-
ings and, in case of important uncertainty for at 
least two annotators, the sentences (54 in total) 
were not taken into account. The BioScope 
corpus re-annotated according to the criteria of 
BioExcom is publicly available5.  
We can divide the segments presenting a 
disagreement between BioExcom and BioS-
cope into two groups depending on the annota-
tion performed either automatically by BioEx-
com or manually in the BioScope corpus (Fig-
ure 3). 
The first group consists of 865 segments 
which were considered as speculations in Bi-
oScope (representing around 36% of the total 
of annotated sentences in BioScope) and which 
were not annotated by BioExcom (see Figure 
2). After manual checking, we found that only 
around one third of these segments in the cor-
pus Full papers were speculative according to 
the criteria of BioExcom. This proportion was 
around one fourth in the BioScope corpus Ab-
stract. The goal of BioExcom to avoid annotat-
ing open questions (see examples (1-2)) or lack 
of knowledge (sentence (8)) can explain some 
of the absences of annotation by BioExcom. 
 
(8) The exact role of the ubiquitination 
pathway in regulating apoptosis is still 
unclear. 
 
In other cases, some differences linked to 
the semantic conception of speculation play a 
role. Thus, the following sentences are consi-
dered as speculative in BioScope: 
 
(9) Furthermore, genetic and 
transplantation studies indicate that 
both Neur and Mib act in a non-
autonomous manner 
[18,21,22,23,25,29], indicating that 
endocytosis of Dl is associated with 
increased Dl signalling activity. 
(10) It can be deduced that the erythroid 
ALAS precursor protein has a molecu-
lar weight of 64.6 kd, and is similar in 
size to the previously isolated human

housekeeping ALAS precursor of mo-
lecular weight 70.6 kd. 
Although these sentences correspond to 
hedging as it has been defined by Hyland 
(1995), we argue that the sentences (9-10) can 
be characterized more as a demonstration or a 
deduction with the expressions ?indicate that? 
and ?it can be deduced? than a speculation. 
According to the criteria used for establishing 
BioExcom rules, these sentences do not cor-
respond to a speculation because they present 
things more or less as certain (see also 
(Thompson et al, 2008)). In this view, the case 
of ?indicate that? is interesting to be detailed. 
Whereas many studies use it as a linguistic 
marker of speculation, Kilicoglu and Bergler 
(2008) recently moderated its speculative 
meaning by highlighting the additional need to 
take into account its context. The linguistic 
analysis used to establish the rules in BioEx-
com is much more restrictive and does not 
consider it as a marker. 
It should also be mentioned that we noticed a 
few sentences which were incorrectly anno-
tated in BioScope as speculation. Thus, the 
sentence (11) is rather, in our opinion, a defi-
nite statement (?or? can be replaced by ?and?).  
 
(11) Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluI 
fragment, when fused to the 
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 
gene driven by the conalbumin 
promoter, stimulated transcription in 
B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or 
HeLa cells.  
 
There are also some sentences annotated in 
Bioscope which are undoubtedly speculations 
but they were not identified by BioExcom. 
Thus, BioExcom has not annotated some spe-
culative sentences because of the lack of some 
accurate markers into its linguistic resources. 
This is the case in the sentence (12): ?seems? is 
recognized by BioExcom only when it is asso-
ciated with some adjectives (?seems probable? 
for example). We can also cite the more ambi-
guous case of ?predicted? (sentence (13)) 
which is also absent from the linguistic re-
sources of BioExcom. Although a prediction 
can be considered as having a more particular 
status because it presents a low degree of un-
certainty, we can consider that it should be 
taken into account because the predicted pro-
posal remains hypothetical.

based on BioExcom segmentation). Spe = speculative segment; no Spe = non speculative segment. 
 
(12) A transcription factor, NF-AT, which 
is essential for early T-cell gene 
activation, seems to be a specific 
target of cyclosporin A and FK506 
action because transcription directed 
by this protein is blocked in T cells 
treated with these drugs, with little or 
no effect on other transcription factors 
such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B.  
(13) Expression of full-length and mutant 
cDNA clones in bacteria reveal that 
the single HMG motif, which is 
predicted to contain two extended 
alpha-helical segments, is sufficient to 
direct the sequence-specific binding of 
TCF-1 alpha to DNA. 
 
Beside the lack of accurate markers, the ab-
sence of specific markers in some sentences 
does not allow the detection of some specula-
tions by BioExcom. For example, in BioEx-
com, the ambiguity of the indicator ?could? 
(past form or conditional form) is lifted by the 
presence of some positive clues expressing 
conditionality or possibility, such as ?if? or 
?whether?. But in the sentence (14), ?could? 
has no clues to be disambiguated and although 
it is a speculation, BioExcom did not annotate 
it. 
 
  (14) This method could be quite useful to 
detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA 
but also other polymorphic 
dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. 
 
The second group consists of segments anno-
tated by BioExcom and not in BioScope  
 
(119 segments, see Figure 2). Around 80% of 
these sentences appeared to be speculative af-
ter manual examination. As an illustration, the 
following sentence is clearly a speculation 
(?We hypothesize that?) but is not annotated in 
BioScope. 
   
  (15) We hypothesize that a mutation of the 
hGR glucocorticoid-binding domain is 
the cause of cortisol resistance. 
 
Finally, based on these results, we decided to 
recalculate the Precision, Recall and F-
Measure to be more in agreement with the no-
tion of speculation as it has been described by 
Descl?s et al (2009) (last lines in Tables 2 and 
3). Corrected Precision, Recall and F-Measure 
are respectively around 99%, 83% and 90% 
(averages calculated from the total of segments 
of the two corpora). These results are close to 
the first evaluation performed by Descl?s et al 
(2009), even if Recall is still lower than pre-
viously. 
Obviously, our results are not directly com-
parable with the prior studies because BioEx-
com does not use exactly the same criteria to 
recognize the speculative sentences and conse-
quently we re-annotated the BioScope corpus 
according to the criteria of BioExcom. One 
other difference is that the source used for lin-
guistic resources and rules of BioExcom is 
completely different from the source of the 
corpus used for the evaluation, aside from the 
studies using directly BioScope like Morante

(2009). Nevertheless, considering that there are 
a few studies using a part of the BioScope cor-
38
pus, it can be interesting to mention that Bio-
Excom achieves good performances in particu-
lar for Precision rate (Table 2 and 3).

6 Conclusion and Perspectives 
Our aim was to test on a large scale (the ma-
nually annotated BioScope corpus) the rule 
based system BioExcom that automatically 
annotates speculations in biomedical papers. 
We observed an important disagreement be-
tween the two annotations and as a result, 
treated it manually.  We put forward three 
principal reasons for the differences in annota-
tion: 
?  The lack of certain linguistic markers in 
BioExcom (false negative): some of them have 
to be added in the system (for example ?seem? 
or ?it appears?). Some other markers are too 
ambiguous to be relevant (for example ?could? 
without a positive clue). 
?  An error in the annotation of BioExcom or in 
BioScope (false positives): this is relatively 
rare, especially for BioExcom, which favors 
the Precision. 
?  The difference of criteria used to determine 
whether a sentence is speculative or not: this is 
the main reason and we discuss it hereafter. 
Obtaining a good manual annotation is a 
recurrent problem in semantic annotation 
(Uren et al, 2006) and some studies have stu-
died the disagreement in human judgment (Ve-
ronis, 1998). This phenomenon is undoubtedly 
found here since Szarvas et al (2008) and 
Descl?s et al (2009) have reported the difficul-
ty even for experts to detect speculations. But 
the disagreement between BioExcom and Bi-
oScope has to be seen almost as a conflict con-
cerning the meaning given to the word ?specu-
lation? and if we agree on its definition, we 
demonstrated the efficiency of BioExcom. 
 Indeed, in order to provide good tools to 
biologists, computational linguists seek to ex-
tract only definite statements and consequently 
try to remove or to present separately hedging. 
Some of them have also tried to indicate the 
degree of uncertainty, in order to better charac-
terize hedging. Despite the promising use of 
weighting of hedging cues (Kilicoglu and 
Bergler, 2008), the task of determining the 
strength of speculation appears to be difficult, 
even for biologists (Light et al, 2004). In 
another hand biologists can also consider spec-
ulation as a source of knowledge (for example, 
Thompson et al (2008) categorize speculation 
as a type of knowledge), giving actual trends, 
new ideas and hypothesis useful for them. In 
this view, BioExcom extracts them according 
to more restrictive criteria and categorizes 
them into ?prior? and ?new? in order to better 
highlight speculations. Knowing the new spec-
ulations of a paper can reveal some of the real 
new output of it and so help to decide which 
paper is worth spending time. The categoriza-
tion into prior speculation highlights the emer-
gence of an idea which is taken into considera-
tion by the scientific community and thus can 
also, at least partially, give an indication of its 
importance among the huge amount of specu-
lations in the literature.  
The availability of the corpora (raw BioEx-
com annotations and re-annotations of BioS-
cope according to these criteria) could help to 
better take into account these views. In particu-
lar, these corpora will be useful to improve the 
rules of BioExcom for detecting speculations. 
And many of the other sentences belonging to 
hedging and discarded during the re-annotation 
process (previously annotated or not in BioS-
cope) will serve to develop other semantic cat-
egories such as demonstration/conclusion or 
deduction.
