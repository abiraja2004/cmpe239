In the analysis of Mandarin, the author used a 
corpus composed of over 750,000 samples transcribed 
automatically from Chinese characters by the com- 
puter through the sequential application of a set 
of phonetic rules developed by the author. The 
result is a classif ication and rank distribution 
of all speech sounds, the phonetic properties, 
frequency distr ibution of symbols, phonemes, syl- 
lables, tones, and their combinations. These 
statistical properties are compared with those of 
the English language. 
INTRODUCTION 
English is widely used throughout the world while Mandarin is spoken 
in China by one quarter of the world's population. It is interest- 
ing to compare the phonetic properties of these two languages and to 
study their similarities and differences to understand the problems 
involved when the speakers of one language learn to speak the other 
language. 
The linguistic aspects of written English and Chinese, such as those 
presented below, have already been studied extensively (see Suen 
(1979 a & b)), e.g. a) the frequency of occurrence of words/ 
characters, b) the statistical distribution of letters/radicals, 
and their combinations, c) the study of syntax, semantics, prag- 
matics, and related areas, and d) translation of one language into 
another. Also the linguistics aspects of spoken English have been 
described in well-known literature (Dewey (1923), Carterette et al
(1974)), e.g. a) the frequency of occurrence of syllables, b) the 
statistical distribution of phonemes and their combination s , c) the 
phonetic system and symbolic representation of sounds, and d) a- 
coustical analysis, recognition and synthesis of the spoken language. 
Such investigations, however, have been rarely conducte~'"on Mandarin, 
the official language spoken in China, owing to many reasons. In 
order to close this gap, the author has initiated several research 
projects aimed specifically at the analysis of these aspects (Suen 
(1979 b)). 
PROPERTIES OF MANDARIN 
Mandarin sounds consist of consonants, vowels, semi-vowels and diph- 
thongs. A Mandarin syllable comprises 1 to 3 such constituents, the 
first symbol is usually a consonant. The syllabic structure of 
Mandarin is shown below. A key to the phonetic symbols used in this

paper can be found in Suen (1979 b).

2. D iphthong /EI /  
3. T r iphthong /I AU/ 
4. Vowel  ? Nasal /AN/ 
5. D iphthong ? Nasal /I ANG/  
6. Consonant  ? Vowel  /B O/ 
7. Consonant  + D iphthong /P AU/ 
8. Consonant  + Tr iphthong /M I AU/ 
9. Consonant  + Vowel  ? Nasal  /RUN/  
10. Consonant  + Diphthong + Nasal /L I ANG/  
Assoc ia ted  with each Mandar in  sy l lab le  is a tone which gives the mu- 
sical  qual i ty.  It is normal ly denoted by a d iacr i t i ca l  mark as 
shown below. A tone speci f ies  the pi tch contour  of the syl lable.  
There are f ive  tones in Mandar in  and they can be descr ibed as 
fo l lows (Suen (1979 b)) : 
Tone Descr iDt ion  Pitch 
i. -- high level 55 
2. / h igh r is ing 35 
3. v low r is ing 214 
4. ~ high fal l ing to low 51 
5. ? neutra l  5 
For example, the sy l lab le  /WOV/, mean ing  "I" in Engl ish, has a low 
r is ing tone. Since there are only about 400 d i f fe rent  sy l lab les  in 
the whole  Mandar in  language, the tone is cruc ia l  in s ign i fy ing the 
mean ing  of words. This property  of Mandar in  is d i s t inc t  from the 
Engl ish sounds. 
COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS  OF DATA 
In computat iona l  l inguist ics ,  it is essent ia l  to have a large col lec-  
t ion of data in order  to der ive re l iab le  results.  The help of a 
COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MANDARIN SOUNDS 373 
computer is indispensable. In this study, computational analysis of 
a corpus composed of more than 750,000 samples of Mandarin syllables 
was made. More details .can be found in Suen (1979 b). Owing to the 
l imitation of space here, this paper only compares the frequency 
distr ibution of Mandarin and English phonemes. The distr ibution of 
English sounds was derived from a study conducted by Carterette and 
Jones (1974). Their phonemic frequencies were obtained from a 
transcription of 15,694 words spoken by 24 subjects. 
REMARKS ON MANDARIN/ENGLISH SOUNDS 
From Tables 1 and 2, one can make the following observations: 
(a) Mandarin consonants occur 8% less frequently than English con- 
sonants 
(b) Semi-vowels are used twice more often in Mandarin than in 
English 
(c) Vowels occur more frequently in Mandarin than in English 
(d) Chinese speakers used diphthongs more often than English 
speakers 
(e) Mandarin tones are not evenly distributed and the 4th tone 
occurs much more frequently than the others 
(f) Although both English and Mandarin have approximately 40 
phonemes, many Mandarin phonemes do not occur in the English 
language, especial ly the retroflex and dental sibi lant sounds, 
and the round-l ipped vowel ~ which occur rather frequently 
(about 12%) in Mandarin conversations 
(g) There is considerable difference in the distr ibution of Mandarin 
and English diphones, triphones, etc. which affect signif icant- 
ly the formation of syllables in these two languages 
(h) Considerable difference also occurs between the syllabic 
structures of English and Mandarin 
(i) There are many more sound patterns in English (about one dis- 
tinct sound for one word) than in Mandarin (only about 1160 
distinct sounds in the entire language) 
Implications of the above on the learning of Mandarin by English 
speakers will be discussed. Their effects on computer synthesis 
and recognition of Mandarin speech will  also be presented. If time 
permits, the author wishes to present his new phonetic system which 
wil l  enable an English speaker to pronounce Mandarin sounds correctly 
and easily. Encouraging results of applying this new system in the 
learning situation will be discussed.
