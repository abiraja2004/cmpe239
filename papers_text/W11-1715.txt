Abstract
The research described in this work focuses
on identifying key components for the task of
irony detection. By means of analyzing a set
of customer reviews, which are considered as
ironic both in social and mass media, we try
to find hints about how to deal with this task
from a computational point of view. Our ob-
jective is to gather a set of discriminating el-
ements to represent irony. In particular, the
kind of irony expressed in such reviews. To
this end, we built a freely available data set
with ironic reviews collected from Amazon.
Such reviews were posted on the basis of an
online viral effect; i.e. contents whose ef-
fect triggers a chain reaction on people. The
findings were assessed employing three clas-
sifiers. The results show interesting hints re-
garding the patterns and, especially, regarding
the implications for sentiment analysis.
1 Introduction
Verbal communication is not a trivial process. It im-
plies to share a common code as well as being able
to infer information beyond the semantic meaning.
A lot of communicative acts imply information not
grammatically expressed to be able to decode the
whole sense: if the hearer is not capable to infer that
information, the communicative process is incom-
plete. Let us consider a joke. The amusing effect
sometimes relies on not given information. If such
information is not filled, the result is a bad, or better
said, a misunderstood joke. This information, which
is not expressed with ?physical? words, supposes a
great challenge, even from a linguistic analysis, be-
cause it points to social and cognitive layers quite
difficult to be computationally represented. One of
the communicative phenomena which better repre-
sents this problem is irony. According to Wilson
and Sperber (2007), irony is essentially a commu-
nicative act which expresses an opposite meaning of
what was literally said.
Due to irony is common in texts that express sub-
jective and deeply-felt opinions, its presence repre-
sents a significant obstacle to the accurate analysis
of sentiment in such texts (cf. Councill et al (2010)).
In this research work we aim at gathering a set of
discriminating elements to represent irony. In par-
ticular, we focus on analyzing a set of customer re-
views (posted on the basis of an online viral effect)
in order to obtain a set of key components to face the
task of irony detection.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-
troduces the theoretical problem of irony. Section 3
presents the related work as well as the evaluation
corpus. Section 4 describes our model and the ex-
periments that were performed. Section 5 assesses
the model and presents the discussion of the results.
Finally, Section 6 draws some final remarks and ad-
dresses the future work.
2 Pragmatic Theories of Irony
Literature divides two primaries classes of irony:
verbal and situational. Most theories agree on the
main property of the former: verbal irony conveys
an opposite meaning; i.e. a speaker says some-
thing that seems to be the opposite of what s/he
means (Colston and Gibbs, 2007). In contrast, sit-
uational irony is a state of the world which is per-
ceived as ironical (Attardo, 2007); i.e. situations that
should not be (Lucariello, 2007). Our work focuses
on verbal irony. This kind of irony is defined as a
way of intentionally denying what it is literally ex-
pressed (Curco?, 2007); i.e. a kind of indirect nega-
tion (Giora, 1995). On the basis of some pragmatic
frameworks, authors focus on certain fine-grained
aspects of this term. For instance, Grice (1975) con-
118
siders that an utterance is ironic if it intentionally
violates some conversational maxims. Wilson and
Sperber (2007) assume that verbal irony must be
understood as echoic; i.e. as a distinction between
use and mention. Utsumi (1996), in contrast, sug-
gests an ironic environment which causes a nega-
tive emotional attitude. According to these points
of view, the elements to conceive a verbal expres-
sion as ironic point to different ways of explaining
the same underlying concept of opposition, but spe-
cially note, however, that most of them rely on lit-
erary studies (Attardo, 2007); thus, their computa-
tional formalization is quite challenging. Further-
more, consider that people have their own concept
of irony, which often does not match with the rules
suggested by the experts. For instance, consider the
following expressions retrieved from the web:
1. ?If you find it hard to laugh at yourself, I would be happy to do
it for you.?
2. ?Let?s pray that the human race never escapes from Earth to
spread its iniquity elsewhere.?
These examples, according to some user-
generated tags, could be either ironic, or sarcastic,
or even satiric. However, the issue we want to fo-
cus does not lie on what tag should be the right
for every expression, but on the fact that there is
not a clear distinction about the boundaries among
these terms. For Colston (2007), sarcasm is a term
commonly used to describe an expression of verbal
irony; whereas for Gibbs (2007), sarcasm along with
jocularity, hyperbole, rhetorical questions, and un-
derstatement, are types of irony. Attardo (2007) in
turn, considers that sarcasm is an overtly aggressive
type of irony. Furthermore, according to Gibbs and
Colston (2007), irony is often compared to satire and
parody.
In accordance with these statements, the limits
among these figurative devices are not clearly dif-
ferentiable. Their differences rely indeed on matters
of usage, tone, and obviousness, which are not so
evident in ordinary communication acts. Therefore,
if there are no formal boundaries to separate these
concepts, even from a theoretical perspective, peo-
ple will not be able to produce ironic expressions as
the experts suggest. Instead, there will be a mix-
ture of expressions pretending to be ironic but being
sarcastic, satiric, or even humorous. This get worse
when dealing with non prototypical examples. Ob-
serve the following fragment from our corpus:
3. ?I am giving this product [a t-shirt] 5 stars because not everyone
out there is a ladies? man. In the hands of lesser beings, it can
help you find love. In the hands of a playa like me, it can only
break hearts. That?s why I say use with caution. I am passing the
torch onto you, be careful out there folks.?
In this text irony is perceived as a mixture of sar-
casm and satire, whose effect is not only based on
expressing an opposite or negative meaning, but a
humorous one as well.
Taking into account these assumptions, we begin
by defining irony as a verbal subjective expression
whose formal constituents attempt to communicate
an underlying meaning, focusing on negative or hu-
morous aspects, which is opposite to the one ex-
pressed. Based on this definition, we consider sar-
casm, satire, and figures such as the ones suggested
in (Gibbs, 2007), as specific extensions of a gen-
eral concept of irony, and consequently, we will not
make any fine-grained distinction among them; i.e.
irony will include them.
3 Approaching Irony Detection
As far as we know, very few attempts have been
carried out in order to integrate irony in a compu-
tational framework. The research described by Ut-
sumi (1996) was one of the first approaches to com-
putationally formalize irony. However, his model
is too abstract to represent irony beyond an ide-
alized hearer-listener interaction. Recently, from
a computational creativity perspective, Veale and
Hao (2009) focused on studying irony by analyz-
ing humorous similes. Their approach gives some
hints to explain the cognitive processes that underly
irony in such structures. In contrast, Carvalho et
al. (2009) suggested some clues for automatically
identifying ironic sentences by means of identifying
features such as emoticons, onomatopoeic expres-
sions, punctuation and quotation marks. Further-
more, there are others approaches which are focused
on particular devices such as sarcasm and satire,
rather than on the whole concept of irony. For in-
stance, Tsur et al (2010) and Davidov et al (2010)
address the problem of finding linguistic elements
that mark the use of sarcasm in online product re-
views and tweets, respectively. Finally, Burfoot and
Baldwin (2009) explore the task of automatic satire
119
detection by evaluating features related to headline
elements, offensive language and slang.
3.1 Evaluation Corpus
Due to the scarce work on automatic irony process-
ing, and to the intrinsic features of irony, it is quite
difficult and subjective to obtain a corpus with ironic
data. Therefore, we decided to rely on the wisdom
of the crowd and use a collection of customer re-
views from the Amazon web site. These reviews
are considered as ironic by customers, as well as by
many journalists, both in mass and social media. Ac-
cording to such means, all these reviews deal with
irony, sarcasm, humor, satire and parody (hence,
they are consistent with our definition of irony). All
of them were posted by means of an online viral
effect, which in most cases, increased the popular-
ity and sales of the reviewed products. The Three
Wolf Moon T-shirt is the clearest example. This item
became one of the most popular products, both in
Amazon as well as in social networks, due to the
ironic reviews posted by people1.
Our positive data are thus integrated with reviews
of five different products published by Amazon. All
of them were posted through the online viral effect.
The list of products is: i) Three Wolf Moon T-shirt
(product id: B002HJ377A); ii) Tuscan Whole Milk
(product id: B00032G1S0); iii) Zubaz Pants (prod-
uct id: B000WVXM0W); iv) Uranium Ore (prod-
uct id: B000796XXM); and v) Platinum Radiant
Cut 3-Stone (product id: B001G603AE). A total of
3,163 reviews were retrieved. Then, in order to au-
tomatically filter the ones more likely to be ironic
without performing a manual annotation (which is
planned to be carried out in the near feature), we re-
moved the reviews whose customer rating, accord-
ing to the Amazon rating criteria, was lesser than
four stars. The assumptions behind this decision rely
on two facts: i) the viral purpose, and ii) the ironic
effect. The former caused that people to post reviews
whose main purpose, and perhaps the only one, was
to exalt superficial properties and non-existent con-
sequences; thus the possibilities to find real reviews
were minimal. Considering this scenario, the lat-
1According to results obtained with Google, apart from the
more than one million of results retrieved when searching this
product, there are more than 10,000 blogs which comment the
effect caused by these reviews.
ter supposes that, if someone ironically wants to re-
flect properties and consequences such as the previ-
ous ones, s/he will not do it by rating the products
with one or two stars, instead, s/he will rate them
with the highest scores.
After applying this filter, we obtained an ironic set
integrated with 2,861 documents. On the other hand,
two negative sets were automatically collected from
two sites: Amazon.com (AMA) and Slashdot.com
(SLA). Each contains 3,000 documents. The prod-
ucts selected from AMA were: Bananagrams (toy),
The Help by Kathryn Stockett (book), Flip Ul-
traHD Camcorder (camera), I Dreamed A Dream
(CD), Wii Fit Plus with Balance Board (Videogame
console). Finally, the data collected from SLA
contain web comments categorized as funny in a
community-driven process. The whole evaluation
corpus is integrated with 8,861 documents. It is
available at http://users.dsic.upv.es/grupos/nle.
4 Model
We define a model with six categories which at-
tempts to represent irony from different linguistic
layers. These categories are: n-grams, POS n-
grams, funny profiling, positive/negative profiling,
affective profiling, and pleasantness profiling.
4.1 N-grams
This category focuses on representing the ironic
documents in the simplest way: with sequences of
n-grams (from order 2 up to 7) in order to find a set
of recurrent words which might express irony. Note
that all the documents were preprocessed. Firstly,
the stopwords were removed, and then, all the doc-
uments were stemmed. The next process consisted
in removing irrelevant terms by applying a tf ? idf
measure. This measure assesses how relevant a word
is, given its frequency both in a document as in the
entire corpus. Irrelevant words such as t-shirt, wolf,
tuscan, milk, etc., were then automatically elimi-
nated. The complete list of filtered words, stopwords
included, contains 824 items. Examples of the most
frequent sequences are given in Table 1.
4.2 POS n-grams
The goal of this category is to obtain recurrent se-
quences of morphosyntactic patterns. According to
120
Table 1: Statistics of the most frequent word n-grams.
Order Sequences Examples
2-grams 160 opposit sex; american flag; alpha male
3-grams 82 sex sex sex; fun educ game
4-grams 78 fun hit reload page; remov danger reef pirat
5-grams 76 later minut custom contribut product
6-grams 72 fals function player sex sex sex
7-grams 69 remov danger reef pirat fewer shipwreck surviv
our definition, irony looks for expressing an oppo-
site meaning; however, the ways of transmitting that
meaning are enormous. Therefore, we pretend to
symbolize an abstract structure through sequences
of POS tags (hereafter, POS-grams) instead of only
words. It is worth highlighting that a statistical sub-
string reduction algorithm (Lu? et al, 2004) was em-
ployed in order to eliminate redundant sequences.
For instance, if the sequences ?he is going to look so
hot in this shirt? and ?he is going to look hot in this
shirt? occur with similar frequencies in the corpus,
then, the algorithm removes the last one because is
a substring of the first one. Later on, we labeled the
documents employing the FreeLing resource (Atse-
rias et al, 2006). The N-best sequences of POS-
grams, according to orders 2 up to 7, are given in
Table 2.
4.3 Funny profiling
Irony takes advantage of humor aspects to produce
its effect. This category intends to characterize the
documents in terms of humorous properties. In or-
der to represent this category, we selected some of
the best humor features reported in the literature:
stylistic features, human centeredness, and keyness.
The stylistic features, according to the experiments
reported in (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2006), were
obtained by collecting all the words labeled with the
tag ?sexuality? in WordNet Domains (Bentivogli et
al., 2004). The second feature focuses on social re-
lationships. In order to retrieve these words, the el-
ements registered in WordNet (Miller, 1995), which
belong to the synsets relation, relationship and
relative, were retrieved. The last feature is repre-
sented by obtaining the keyness value of the words
(cf. (Reyes et al, 2009)). This value is calculated
comparing the word frequencies in the ironic doc-
uments against their frequencies in a reference cor-
pus. Google N-grams (Brants and Franz, 2006) was
Table 2: Statistics of the most frequent POS-grams.
Order Sequences Examples
2-grams 300 dt nn; nn in; jj nn; nn nn
3-grams 298 dt nn in; dt jj nn; jj nn nn
4-grams 282 nn in dt nn; vb dt jj nn
5-grams 159 vbd dt vbg nn jj
6-grams 39 nnp vbd dt vbg nn jj
7-grams 65 nns vbd dt vbg nn jj fd
used as the reference corpus. Only the words whose
keyness was ? 100 were kept.
4.4 Positive/Negative Profiling
As we have already pointed out, one of the most im-
portant properties of irony relies on the communi-
cation of negative information through positive one.
This category intends to be an indicator about the
correlation between positive and negative elements
in the data. The Macquarie Semantic Orientation
Lexicon (MSOL) (Saif et al, 2009) was used to la-
bel the data. This lexicon contains 76,400 entries
(30,458 positive and 45,942 negative ones).
4.5 Affective Profiling
In order to enhance the quality of the information
related to the expression of irony, we considered to
represent information linked to psychological lay-
ers. The affective profiling category is an attempt
to characterize the documents in terms of words
which symbolize subjective contents such as emo-
tions, feelings, moods, etc. The WordNet-Affect
resource (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) was em-
ployed for obtaining the affective terms. This re-
source contains 11 classes to represent affectiveness.
According to the authors, these classes represent
how speakers convey affective meanings by means
of selecting certain words and not others.
4.6 Pleasantness Profiling
The last category is an attempt to represent ideal
cognitive scenarios to express irony. This means
that, like words, the contexts in which irony ap-
pears are enormous. Therefore, since it is impos-
sible to make out all the possibilities, we pretend to
define a schema to represent favorable and unfavor-
able ironic contexts on the basis of pleasantness val-
ues. In order to represent those values, we used the
Dictionary of Affect in Language (Whissell, 1989).
This dictionary assigns a score of pleasantness to
121
? 9,000 English words. The scores were obtained
from human ratings. The range of scores goes from
1 (unpleasant) to 3 (pleasant).
5 Evaluation
In order to verify the effectiveness of our model, we
evaluated it through a classification task. Two un-
derlying goals were analyzed: a) feature relevance;
and b) the possibility of automatically finding ironic
documents.
The classifiers were evaluated by comparing the
positive set against each of the two negative subsets
(AMA and SLA, respectively). All the documents
were represented as frequency-weighted term vec-
tors according to a representativeness ratio. This ra-
tio was estimated using Formula 1:
?(dk) =
?
i,j fdfi,j
|d|
(1)
where i is the i-th conceptual category (i = 1. . . 6);
j is the j-th feature of i; fdfi,j (feature dimension
frequency) is the frequency of features j of cate-
gory i; and |d| is the length of the k-th document
dk. For categories funny, positive/negative, affec-
tive, and pleasantness, we determined an empirical
threshold of representativeness ? 0.5. A document
was assigned the value = 1 (presence) if its ? ex-
ceeded the threshold, otherwise a value = 0 (ab-
sence) was assigned. A different criterion was de-
termined for the n-grams and POS-grams because
we were not only interested in knowing whether or
not the sequences appeared in the corpus, but also in
obtaining a measure to represent the degree of simi-
larity among the sets. In order to define a similarity
score, we used the Jaccard similarity coefficient.
The classification accuracy was assessed employ-
ing three classifiers: Na??ve Bayes (NB), support vec-
tor machines (SVM), and decision trees (DT). The
sets were trained with 5,861 instances (2,861 posi-
tive and 3,000 negative ones). 10-fold cross valida-
tion method was used as test. Global accuracy as
well as detailed performance in terms of precision,
recall, and F ?measure, are given in Table 3.
5.1 Discussion
Regarding the first goal (feature relevance), our a-
priori aim of representing some irony features in
Table 3: Classification results.
Accuracy Precision Recall F-Measure
AMA 72,18% 0,745 0,666 0,703
NB SLA 75,19% 0,700 0,886 0,782
AMA 75,75% 0,771 0,725 0,747
SVM SLA 73,34% 0,706 0,804 0,752
AMA 74,13% 0,737 0,741 0,739
DT SLA 75,12% 0,728 0,806 0,765
terms of six general categories seems to be accept-
able. According to the results depicted in Table 3,
the proposed model achieves good rates of classifi-
cation which support this assumption: from 72% up
to 89%, whereas a classifier that labels all texts as
non-ironic would achieve an accuracy around 54%.
Moreover, both precision and recall, as well as F-
measure rates corroborate the effectiveness of such
performance: most of classifiers obtained scores >
0.7. This means that, at least regarding the data sets
employed in the experiments, the capabilities for dif-
ferentiating an ironic review from a non-ironic one,
or a web comment, are satisfactory.
With respect to the second goal, an information
gain filter was applied in order to verify the rel-
evance of the model for finding ironic documents
regarding the different discourses profiled in each
negative subset. In Table 4 we detailed the most dis-
criminating categories per subset according to their
information gain scores. On the basis of the re-
sults depicted in this table, it is evident how the
relevance of the categories varies in function of the
negative subset. For instance, when classifying the
AMA subset, it is clear how the POS-grams (order
3), pleasantness and funny categories, are the most
informative ones; in contrast, the pleasantness, n-
grams (order 5) and funny categories, are the most
relevant ones regarding the SLA subset. Moreover,
it is important to note how the negative words, with-
out being the most differentiable ones, function as
discriminating elements.
Table 4: The 5 most discriminating categories regarding
information gain results.
AMA POS 3-grams Pleasantness Funny POS 2-grams POS 4-grams
SLA Pleasantness 5-grams Funny Affectiveness 6-grams
Taking into consideration all previous remarks,
we would like to stress some observations with re-
122
spect to each category. Regarding the n-grams, it
is important to note the presence of some interesting
sequences which are not common to the three sub-
sets. For instance: pleasantly surprised. How-
ever, we cannot define irony only in terms of these
sequences because they might represent domain-
specific information such as the bigram: customer
service.
With respect to the POS-grams, the fact of
focusing on morphosyntactic templates instead of
only on words seem to be more affective. For
instance, the sequence noun + verb + noun +
adjective would represent more information than
the sum of simple words: [grandpa/hotel/bed]
+ [looks/appears/seems] + [years/days/months] +
[younger/bigger/dirtier]. These sequences of POS
tags show how an abstract representation could be
more useful than a simple word representation.
The funny category seems to be a relevant ele-
ment to express irony. However, its relevance might
be supported by the kind of information profiled in
the positive set. Considering the comic trend in the
reviews posted by Amazon?s customers, it is likely
that many of the words belonging to this category
appeared in such reviews. For instance, in the fol-
lowing example the words in italics represent funny
elements: ?I am an attractive guy. Slender, weak,
and I have never shaved in my 19 years, but sexy as
hell, and I cannot tell you how many women have
flocked to me since my purchase?. Regardless, it
is important to stress that this category is equally
discriminating for all sets, funny web comments in-
cluded.
Concerning the positive/negative profiling, it is
necessary to emphasize that, despite the greater
number of negative words in the MSOL (more than
15,000 words of difference; cf. Section 4.4), the
positive elements are the most representative in
the ironic documents. This fact corroborates the
assumption about the use of positive information
in order to express an underlying negative mean-
ing: ?The coolPOS, refreshingPOS tastePOS of the
milkPOS washed away my painNEG and its kosherPOS
sourcePOS of calciumPOS wash away my fearNEG?.
Regarding the affective category, its relevance is
not as important as we have a-priori considered, de-
spite it is one of the categories used to discriminate
the SLA subset: ?Man, that was weird . . . I think is
funny, because there?s a good overlap?. However,
if we take into account the whole accuracy for this
subset, then we can conclude that its relevance is mi-
nor. Nonetheless, we still consider that the affective
information is a valuable factor which must be taken
into account in order to provide rich knowledge re-
lated to subjective layers of linguistic representation.
The role played by the pleasantness category on
the classifications is significant. Despite the cate-
gory is not the most discriminating, its effectiveness
for increasing the classification accuracy is remark-
able. For instance, consider the following ironic sen-
tence: ?I became the man I always dreamed I
could be all those nights staying up late watching
wrestling?, where most of its constituents are words
whose pleasantness score is ? 2.5; i.e. these words
(in italics) should communicate information related
to favorable pleasant contexts.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
Irony is one of the most subjective phenomena re-
lated to linguistic analysis. Its automatic processing
is a real challenge, not only from a computational
perspective but from a linguistic one as well. In this
work we have suggested a model of six categories
which attempts to describe salient characteristics of
irony. They intend to symbolize low and high level
properties of irony on the basis of formal linguis-
tic elements. This model was assessed by creating
a freely available data set with ironic reviews. The
results achieved with three different classifiers are
satisfactory, both in terms of classification accuracy,
as well as precision, recall, and F-measure. Further
work consists of improving the quality of every cat-
egory, as well as of identifying new ones in order to
come up with an improved model capable to detect
better ironic patterns in different kinds of texts.
