Abstract
The goal of the Cross-lingual Word Sense Disam-
biguation task is to evaluate the viability of multilin-
gual WSD on a benchmark lexical sample data set.
The traditional WSD task is transformed into a mul-
tilingual WSD task, where participants are asked to
provide contextually correct translations of English
ambiguous nouns into five target languages, viz.
French, Italian, English, German and Dutch. We re-
port results for the 12 official submissions from 5
different research teams, as well as for the ParaSense
system that was developed by the task organizers.
1 Introduction
Lexical ambiguity remains one of the major prob-
lems for current machine translation systems. In
the following French sentence ?Je cherche des ide?es
pour manger de l?avocat?1, the word ?avocat? is
clearly referring to the fruit, whereas both Google
Translate2 as well as Babelfish3 translate the word
as ?lawyer?. Although ?lawyer? is a correct transla-
tion of the word ?avocat?, it is the wrong translation
in this context. Other language technology applica-
tions, such as Question Answering (QA) systems or
information retrieval (IR) systems, also suffer from
the poor contextual disambiguation of word senses.
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is still consid-
ered one of the most challenging problems within
1English translation: ?I?m looking for ideas to eat avocado?.

language technology today. It requires the construc-
tion of an artificial text understanding as the sys-
tem should detect the correct word sense based on
the context of the word. Different methodologies
have been investigated to solve the problem; see for
instance Agirre and Edmonds (2006) and Navigli
(2009) for a detailed overview of WSD algorithms
and evaluation.
This paper reports on the second edition of
the ?Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation?
(CLWSD) task, that builds further on the insights we
gained from the SemEval-2010 evaluation (Lefever
and Hoste, 2010b) and for which new test data were
annotated. The task is an unsupervised Word Sense
Disambiguation task for English nouns, the sense
label of which is composed of translations in dif-
ferent target languages (viz. French, Italian, Span-
ish, Dutch and German). The sense inventory is
built up on the basis of the Europarl parallel corpus;
all translations of a polysemous word were manu-
ally grouped into clusters, which constitute different
senses of that given word. For the test data, native
speakers assigned a translation cluster(s) to each test
sentence and gave their top three translations from
the predefined list of Europarl translations, in order
to assign weights to the set of gold standard transla-
tions.
The decision to recast the more traditional mono-
lingual WSD task into a cross-lingual WSD task was
motivated by the following arguments. Firstly, using
multilingual unlabeled parallel corpora contributes
to clearing the data acquisition bottleneck for WSD,
because using translations as sense labels excludes
the need for manually created sense-tagged corpora
158
and sense inventories such as WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) or EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998). Moreover,
as there is fairly little linguistic knowledge involved,
the framework can be easily deployed for a variety
of different languages. Secondly, a cross-lingual ap-
proach also deals with the sense granularity prob-
lem; finer sense distinctions are only relevant as far
as they get lexicalized in different translations of
the word. If we take the English word ?head? as
an example, we see that this word is always trans-
lated as ?hoofd? in Dutch (both for the ?chief? and
for the ?body part? sense of the word). At the same
time, the subjectivity problem is tackled that arises
when lexicographers have to construct a fixed set of
senses for a particular word that should fit all possi-
ble domains and applications. In addition, the use
of domain-specific corpora allows to derive sense
inventories that are tailored towards a specific tar-
get domain or application and to train a dedicated
CLWSD system using these particular sense inven-
tories. Thirdly, working immediately with transla-
tions instead of more abstract sense labels allows to
bypass the need to map abstract sense labels to cor-
responding translations. This makes it easier to inte-
grate a dedicated WSD module into real multilingual
applications such as machine translation (Carpuat
and Wu, 2007) or information retrieval (Clough and
Stevenson, 2004).
Many studies have already shown the validity of a
cross-lingual approach to Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993;
Ng et al, 2003; Diab, 2004; Tufis? et al, 2004;
Chan and Ng, 2005; Specia et al, 2007; Apidi-
anaki, 2009). The Cross-lingual WSD task con-
tributes to this research domain by the construction
of a dedicated benchmark data set where the am-
biguous words were annotated with the senses from
a multilingual sense inventory extracted from a par-
allel corpus. This benchmark data sets allows a de-
tailed comparison between different approaches to
the CLWSD task.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 focuses on the task description and
briefly recapitalizes the construction of the sense in-
ventory and the annotation procedure of the test sen-
tences. Section 3 presents the participating systems
to the task, whereas Section 4 gives an overview of
the experimental setup and results. Section 5 con-
cludes this paper.
2 Task set up
The ?Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation?
(CLWSD) task was organized for the first time in the
framework of SemEval-2010 (Lefever and Hoste,
2010b) and resulted in 16 submissions from five
different research teams. Many additional research
teams showed their interest and downloaded the trial
data, but did not manage to finish their systems in
time. In order to gain more insights into the com-
plexity and the viability of cross-lingual WSD, we
proposed a second edition of the task for SemEval-
2013 for which new test data were annotated.
The CLWSD task is an unsupervised Word Sense
Disambiguation task for a lexical sample of twenty
English nouns. The sense label of the nouns is com-
posed of translations in five target languages (viz.
Spanish, French, German, Italian and Dutch) and
the sense inventory is built up on the basis of the
Europarl parallel corpus4. This section briefly de-
scribes the data construction process for the task.
For a more detailed description of the gold stan-
dard creation and data annotation process, we refer
to Lefever and Hoste (2010a; 2010b).
2.1 Sense inventory
The starting point for the gold standard sense inven-
tory creation was the parallel corpus Europarl. We
selected six languages from Europarl (English and
the five target languages) and only considered the 1-
1 sentence alignments between English and the five
target languages5. In order to obtain the multilingual
sense inventory we:
1. performed word alignment on the parallel cor-
pus in order to find all possible translations for
our set of ambiguous focus nouns
2. clustered the resulting translations by meaning
and manually lemmatized all translations
The resulting sense inventory was then used to an-
notate the sentences in the test set that was devel-
oped for the SemEval-2013 CLWSD task.

pus of Europarl can be downloaded from

2.2 Test data
For the creation of the test data set, we manually se-
lected 50 sentences per ambiguous focus word from
the part of the ANC corpus that is publicly avail-
able6. In total, 1000 sentences were annotated us-
ing the sense inventory that was described in Sec-
tion 2.1. Three annotators per target language were
asked to first select the correct sense cluster and next
to choose the three contextually most appropriate
translations from this sense cluster. They could also
provide fewer translations in case they could not find
three good translations for this particular occurrence
of the test word. These translations were used to
(1) compose the set of gold standard translations per
test instance and (2) to assign frequency weights to
all translations in the gold standard (e.g. translations
that were chosen by all three annotators get a fre-
quency weight of 3 in the gold standard).
2.3 Evaluation tasks
Two subtasks were proposed for the Cross-lingual
WSD task: a best evaluation and an Out-of-five eval-
uation task. For the best evaluation, systems can
propose as many guesses as the system believes are
correct, but the score is divided by the number of
guesses. In case of the Out-of-five evaluation, sys-
tems can propose up to five guesses per test instance
without being penalized for wrong translation sug-
gestions. Both evaluation tasks are explained in
more detail in Section 4.1.
3 Systems
3.1 Systems participating to the official
CLWSD evaluation campaign
Five different research teams participated to the
CLWSD task and submitted up to three different
runs of their system, resulting in 12 different sub-
missions for the task. All systems took part in both
the best and the Out-of-five evaluation tasks. These
systems took very different approaches to solve the
task, ranging from statistical machine translation,
classification and sense clustering to topic model
based approaches.
The XLING team (Tan and Bond, 2013) submit-
ted three runs of their system for all five target lan-
guages. The first version of the system presents a
6http://www.americannationalcorpus.org/
topic matching and translation approach to CLWSD
(TnT run), where LDA is applied on the Europarl
sentences containing the ambiguous focus word in
order to train topic models. Each sentence in the
training corpus is assigned a topic that contains a
list of associated words with the topic. The topic
of the test sentence is then inferred and compared
to the matching training sentences by means of the
cosine similarity between the training and test vec-
tors. WordNet (WN) is used as a fallback in case
the system returns less than 5 answers. The second -
and best performing - flavor of the system (SnT run)
calculates the cosine similarity between the context
words of the test and training sentences. The out-
put of the system then contains the translation that
results from running word alignment on the focus
word in the training corpus. As a fallback, Word-
Net is again used. The WN senses are sorted by fre-
quency in the SemCor corpus and the correspond-
ing translation is selected from the aligned WordNet
in the target language. The third run of the system
(merged) combines the output from the other two
flavors of the system.
The LIMSI system (Apidianaki, 2013) applies an
unsupervised CLWSD method that was proposed in
(Apidianaki, 2009) for three target languages, viz.
Spanish, Italian and French. First, word alignment
is applied on the parallel corpus and three bilingual
lexicons are built, containing for each focus word
the translations in the three target languages. In a
next step, a vector is built for each translation of the
English focus word, using the cooccurrences of the
word in the sentences in which it gets this particu-
lar translation. A clustering algorithm then groups
the feature vectors using the Weighted Jaccard mea-
sure. New instances containing the ambiguous focus
word are then compared to the training feature vec-
tors and assigned to one of the sense clusters. In
case the highest-ranked translation in the cluster has
a score below the threshold, the system falls back to
the most frequent translation.
Two very well performing systems take a
classification-based approach to the CLWSD task:
the HLTDI and WSD2 systems. The HLTDI sys-
tem (Rudnick et al, 2013) performs word alignment
on the intersected Europarl corpus to locate train-
ing instances containing the ambiguous focus words.
The first flavor of the system (l1) uses a maxent clas-
160
sifier that is trained over local context features. The
L2 model (l2 run) also adds translations of the fo-
cus word into the four other target languages to the
feature vector. To disambiguate new test instances,
these translations into the four other languages are
estimated using the classifiers built in the first ver-
sion of the system (l1). The third system run (mrf )
builds a Markov network of L1 classifiers in order to
find the best translation into all five target languages
jointly. The nodes of this network correspond to the
distribution produced by the L1 classifiers, while the
edges contain pairwise potentials derived from the
joint probabilities of translation labels occurring to-
gether in the training data.
Another classification-based approach is pre-
sented by the WSD2 system (van Gompel and
van den Bosch, 2013), that uses a k-NN classifier
to solve the CLWSD task. The first configuration
of the system (c1l) uses local context features for a
window of three words containing the focus word.
Parameters were optimized on the trial data. The
second flavor of the system (c1lN) uses the same
configuration of the system, but without parameter
optimization. The third configuration of the system
(var) is heavily optimized on the trial data, selecting
the winning configuration per trial word and evalua-
tion metric. In addition to the local context features,
also global bag-of-word context features are consid-
ered for this version of the system.
A completely different approach is taken by the
NRC-SMT system (Carpuat, 2013), that uses a sta-
tistical machine translation approach to tackle the
CLWSD task. The baseline version of the system
(SMTbasic) represents a standard phrase-based SMT
baseline, that is trained only on the intersected Eu-
roparl corpus. Translations for the test instances are
extracted from the top hypothesis (for the best eval-
uation) or from the 100-best list (for the Out-of-five
evaluation). The optimized version of the system
(SMTadapt2) is trained on the Europarl corpus and
additional news data, and uses mixture models that
are developed for domain adaptation in SMT.
In addition to the five systems that participated to
the official evaluation campaign, the organizers also
present results for their ParaSense system, which is
described in the following section.
3.2 ParaSense system
The ParaSense system (Lefever et al, 2013)
is a multilingual classification-based approach to
CLWSD. A combination of both local context in-
formation and translational evidence is used to dis-
criminate between different senses of the word, the
underlying hypothesis being that using multilingual
information should be more informative than only
having access to monolingual or bilingual features.
The local context features contain the word form,
lemma, part-of-speech and chunk information for a
window of seven words containing the ambiguous
focus word. In addition, a set of bag-of-words fea-
tures is extracted from the aligned translations that
are not the target language of the classifier. Per
ambiguous focus word, a list of all content words
(nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs) that occurred
in the linguistically preprocessed aligned transla-
tions of the English sentences containing this word,
were extracted. Each content word then corresponds
to exactly one binary feature per language. For the
construction of the translation features for the train-
ing set, we used the Europarl aligned translations.
As we do not dispose of similar aligned transla-
tions for the test instances for which we only have
the English test sentences at our disposal, we used
the Google Translate API7 to automatically gener-
ate translations for all English test instances in the
five target languages.
As a classifier, we opted for the k Nearest neigh-
bor method as implemented in TIMBL (Daelemans
and van den Bosch, 2005). As most classifiers can
be initialized with a wide range of parameters, we
used a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameter
settings for our classification task.
4 Results
4.1 Experimental set up
Test set The lexical sample contains 50 English
sentences per ambiguous focus word. All instances
were manually annotated per language, which re-
sulted in a set of gold standard translation labels per
instance. For the construction of the test dataset, we
refer to Section 2.

Evaluation metric The BEST precision and recall
metric was introduced by (McCarthy and Navigli,
2007) in the framework of the SemEval-2007 com-
petition. The metric takes into account the frequency
weights of the gold standard translations: transla-
tions that were picked by different annotators re-
ceived a higher associated frequency which is incor-
porated in the formulas for calculating precision and
recall. For the BEST precision and recall evaluation,
the system can propose as many guesses as the sys-
tem believes are correct, but the resulting score is
divided by the number of guesses. In this way, sys-
tems that output many guesses are not favored and
systems can maximize their score by guessing the
most frequent translation from the annotators. We
also calculate Mode precision and recall, where pre-
cision and recall are calculated against the transla-
tion that is preferred by the majority of annotators,
provided that one translation is more frequent than
the others.
The following variables are used for the BEST pre-
cision and recall formulas. Let H be the set of an-
notators, T the set of test words and hi the set of
translations for an item i ? T for annotator h ? H .
Let A be the set of words from T where the system
provides at least one answer and ai the set of guesses
from the system for word i ? A. For each i, we cal-
culate the multiset union (Hi) for all hi for all h ? H
and for each unique type (res) in Hi that has an as-
sociated frequency (freqres). Equation 1 lists the
BEST precision formula, whereas Equation 2 lists
the formula for calculating the BEST recall score:
Precision =

Most Frequent translation baseline As a base-
line, we selected the most frequent lemmatized
translation that resulted from the automated word
alignment (GIZA++) for all ambiguous nouns in the
training data. This baseline is inspired by the most
frequent sense baseline often used in WSD evalu-
ations. The main difference between the most fre-
quent sense baseline and our baseline is that the lat-
ter is corpus-dependent: we do not take into account
the overall frequency of a word as it would be mea-
sured based on a large general purpose corpus, but
calculate the most frequent sense (or translation in
this case) based on our training corpus.
4.2 Experimental results
For the system evaluation results, we show preci-
sion and Mode precision figures for both evaluation
types (best and Out-of-five). In our case, precision
refers to the number of correct translations in rela-
tion to the total number of translations generated by
the system, while recall refers to the number of cor-
rect translations generated by the classifier. As all
participating systems predict a translation label for
all sentences in the test set, precision and recall will
give identical results. As a consequence, we do not
list the recall and Mode recall figures that are in this
case identical to the corresponding precision scores.
Table 1 lists the averaged best precision scores
for all systems, while Table 2 gives an overview
of the best Mode precision figures for all five tar-
get languages, viz. Spanish (Es), Dutch (Nl), Ger-
man (De), Italian (It) and French (Fr). We list scores
for all participating systems in the official CLWSD
evaluation campaign, as well as for the organiz-
ers? system ParaSense, that is not part of the offi-
cial SemEval competition. The best results for the
best precision evaluation are achieved by the NRC-
SMTadapt2 system for Spanish and by the WSD2
system for the other four target languages, closely
followed by the HLTDI system. The latter two sys-
tems also obtain the best results for the best Mode
precision metric.
Table 3 lists the averaged Out-of-five precision
scores for all systems, while Table 4 gives an
overview of the Out-of-five Mode precision figures
for all five target languages, viz. Spanish (Es), Dutch
(Nl), German (De), Italian (It) and French (Fr). For
the Out-of-five evaluation, where systems are al-
lowed to generate up to five unique translations with-
out being penalized for wrong translations, again the
HLTDI and WSD2 systems obtain the best classifi-
cation performance.
Although the winning systems use different ap-
proaches (statistical machine translation and classi-
162
fication algorithms), they have in common that they
only use a parallel corpus to extract disambiguating
information, and do not use external resources such
as WordNet. As a consequence, this makes the sys-
tems very flexible and language-independent. The
ParaSense system, that incorporates translation in-
formation from four other languages, outperforms
all other systems, except for the best precision met-
ric in Spanish, where the NRC-SMT system obtains
the overall best results. This confirms the hypothe-
sis that a truly multilingual approach to WSD, which
incorporates translation information from multiple
languages into the feature vector, is more effective
than only using monolingual or bilingual features.
A possible explanation could be that the differences
between the different languages that are integrated
in the feature vector enable the system to refine
the obtained sense distinctions. We indeed see that
the ParaSense system outperforms the classification-
based bilingual approaches which exploit similar in-
formation (e.g. training corpora and machine learn-
ing algorithms).

Table 4: OUT-OF-FIVE Mode precision scores averaged
over all twenty test words for Spanish (Es), Dutch (Nl),
German (De), Italian (It) and French (Fr).
In general, we notice that French and Spanish
have the highest scores, while Dutch and German
seem harder to tackle. Italian is situated some-
where in between the Romance and Germanic lan-
guages. This trend confirms the results that were ob-
tained during the first SemEval Cross-lingual WSD
task (Lefever and Hoste, 2010b). As pointed out af-
ter the first competition, the discrepancy between the
scores for the Romance and Germanic languages can
probably be explained by the number of classes (or
translations in this case) the systems have to choose
from. Germanic languages are typically charac-
terized by a very productive compounding system,
where compounds are joined together in one ortho-
graphic unit, which results in a much higher number
of different class labels. As the Romance languages
typically write compounds in separate orthographic
units, they dispose of a smaller number of different
translations for each ambiguous noun.
We can also notice large differences between the
scores for the individual words. Figure 1 illustrates
this by showing the best precision scores in Span-
ish for the different test words for the best run per
system. Except for some exceptions (e.g. coach in
the NRC-SMT system), most system performance
scores follow a similar curve. Some words (e.g.
match, range) are particularly hard to disambiguate,
while others obtain very high scores (e.g. mission,
soil). One possible explanation for the very good
scores for some words (e.g. soil) can be attributed
to a very generic translation which accounts for all
senses of the word even though there might be more
suitable translations for each of the senses depend-
ing on the context. Because the manual annota-
tors were able to select three good translations for
each test instance, the most generic translation is of-
ten part of the gold standard translations. This is
also reflected in the high baseline scores for these
words. For the words performing badly in most sys-
tems, an inspection of the training data properties
revealed two possible explanations for these poor
classification results. Firstly, there seems to be a
link with the number of training instances, corre-
sponding to the frequency of the word in the train-
ing corpus. Both for coach and match, two words
consistently performing bad in all systems, there are
very few training examples in the corpus (66 and
109 respectively). This could also explain why the
NRC-SMT system, that also uses additional paral-
lel data, achieves better results for coach than all
other systems. Secondly, the ambiguity or number
of valid translations per word in the training data
also seems to play a role in the classification results.
Both job and range appear very hard to classify cor-
rectly, and both words are very ambiguous, with no
fewer than 121 and 125 translations, respectively, to
choose from in Spanish.
5 Conclusion
The Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task
attempts to address three important challenges for
WSD, namely (1) the data acquisition bottleneck,
which is caused by the lack of manually created re-
sources, (2) the sense granularity and subjectivity
problem of the existing sense inventories and (3) the
need to make WSD more suited for practical appli-
cations. The task contributes to the WSD research
domain by the construction of a dedicated bench-
mark data set that allows to compare different ap-
proaches to the Cross-lingual WSD task.
The evaluation results lead to the following ob-
servations. Firstly, languages which make exten-

sive use of single word compounds seem harder
to tackle, which can probably be explained by the
higher number of translations these classifiers have
to choose from. Secondly, we can notice large dif-
ferences between the performances of the individual
test words. For the words that appear harder to dis-
ambiguate, both the number of training instances as
well as the ambiguity of the word seem to play a role
for the classification performance. Thirdly, both the
ParaSense system as well as the two winning sys-
tems from the competition extract all disambiguat-
ing information from the parallel corpus and do not
use any external resources. As a result, these sys-
tems are very flexible and can be easily extended to
other languages and domains. In addition, the good
scores of the ParaSense system, that incorporates in-
formation from four additional languages, confirms
the hypothesis that a truly multilingual approach is
an effective way to tackle the CLWSD task.
