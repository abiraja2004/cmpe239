Abstract
This paper describes the machine translation
(MT) system developed by the Transducens
Research Group, from Universitat d?Alacant,
Spain, for the WMT 2011 shared transla-
tion task. We submitted a hybrid system for
the Spanish?English language pair consist-
ing of a phrase-based statistical MT system
whose phrase table was enriched with bilin-
gual phrase pairs matching transfer rules and
dictionary entries from the Apertium shallow-
transfer rule-based MT platform. Our hybrid
system outperforms, in terms of BLEU, GTM
and METEOR, a standard phrase-based statis-
tical MT system trained on the same corpus,
and received the second best BLEU score in
the automatic evaluation.
1 Introduction
This paper describes the system submitted by
the Transducens Research Group (Universitat
d?Alacant, Spain) to the shared translation task of
the EMNLP 2011 Sixth Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation (WMT 2011). We partici-
pated in the Spanish?English task with a hybrid sys-
tem that combines, in a phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (PBSMT) system, bilingual infor-
mation obtained from parallel corpora in the usual
way (Koehn, 2010, ch. 5), and bilingual informa-
tion from the Spanish?English language pair in the
Apertium (Forcada et al, 2011) rule-based machine
translation (RMBT) platform.
A wide range of hybrid approaches (Thurmair,
2009) may be taken in order to build a machine
translation system which takes advantage of a par-
allel corpus and explicit linguistic information from
RBMT. In particular, our hybridisation approach di-
rectly enriches the phrase table of a PBSMT system
with phrase pairs generated from the explicit lin-
guistic resources from an Apertium-based shallow-
transfer RBMT system. Apertium, which is de-
scribed in detail below, does not perform a complete
syntactic analysis of the input sentences, but rather
works with simpler linear intermediate representa-
tions.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Next
section overviews the two MT systems we combine
in our submission. Section 3 outlines related hybrid
approaches, whereas our approach is described in
Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 describe, respectively,
the resources we used to build our submission and
the results achieved for the Spanish?English lan-
guage pair. The paper ends with some concluding
remarks.
2 Translation approaches
We briefly describe the rationale behind the PBSMT
(section 2.1) and the shallow-transfer RBMT (sec-
tion 2.2) systems we have used in our hybridisation
approach.
2.1 Phrase-based statistical machine
translation
Phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-
tems (Koehn et al, 2003) translate sentences by
maximising the translation probability as defined
by the log-linear combination of a number of fea-
ture functions, whose weights are chosen to opti-
457
mise translation quality (Och, 2003). A core com-
ponent of every PBSMT system is the phrase ta-
ble, which contains bilingual phrase pairs extracted
from a bilingual corpus after word alignment (Och
and Ney, 2003). The set of translations from which
the most probable one is chosen is built by segment-
ing the source-language (SL) sentence in all possi-
ble ways and then combining the translation of the
different source segments according to the phrase ta-
ble. Common feature functions are: source-to-target
and target-to-source phrase translation probabilities,
source-to-target and target-to-source lexical weight-
ings (calculated by using a probabilistic bilingual
dictionary), reordering costs, number of words in
the output (word penalty), number of phrase pairs
used (phrase penalty), and likelihood of the output
as given by a target-language (TL) model.
2.2 Shallow-transfer rule-based machine
translation
The RBMT process (Hutchins and Somers, 1992)
can be split into three different steps: i) analysis of
the SL text to build a SL intermediate representation,
ii) transfer from that SL intermediate representation
to a TL intermediate representation, and iii) genera-
tion of the final translation from the TL intermediate
representation.
Shallow-transfer RBMT systems use relatively
simple intermediate representations, which are
based on lexical forms consisting of lemma, part
of speech and morphological inflection information
of the words in the input sentence, and apply sim-
ple shallow-transfer rules that operate on sequences
of lexical forms: this kind of systems do not per-
form a full parsing. Apertium (Forcada et al, 2011),
the shallow-transfer RBMT platform we have used,
splits the transfer step into structural and lexical
transfer. The lexical transfer is done by using a bilin-
gual dictionary which, for each SL lexical form, al-
ways provides the same TL lexical form; thus, no
lexical selection is performed. Multi-word expres-
sions (such as on the other hand, which acts as a
single adverb) may be analysed by Apertium to (or
generated from) a single lexical form.
Structural transfer in Apertium is done by apply-
ing a set of rules in a left-to-right, longest-match
fashion to prevent the translation from being per-
formed word for word in those cases in which this
would result in an incorrect translation. Structural
transfer rules process sequences of lexical forms by
performing operations such as reorderings or gen-
der and number agreements. For the translation be-
tween non-related language pairs, such as Spanish?
English, the structural transfer may be split into
three levels in order to facilitate the writing of rules
by linguists. The first level performs short-distance
operations, such as gender and number agreement
between nouns and adjectives, and groups sequences
of lexical forms into chunks; second-level rules per-
form inter chunk operations, such as agreements be-
tween more distant constituents (i.e. subject and
main verb); and third-level ones de-encapsulate the
chunks and generate a sequence of TL lexical forms
from each chunk. Note that, although the multi-
level shallow transfer allows performing operations
between words which are distant in the source sen-
tence, shallow-transfer RBMT systems are less pow-
erful that the ones which perform full parsing. In ad-
dition, each lexical form is processed at most by one
rule in the same level.
The following example illustrates how lexical and
structural transfer are performed in Apertium. Sup-
pose that the Spanish sentence Por otra parte mis
amigos americanos han decidido venir is to be trans-
lated into English. First, it is analysed as:
por otra parte<adv>
m??o<det><pos><mf><pl>
amigo<n><m><pl>
americano<adj><m><pl>
haber<vbhaver><pri><p3><pl>
decidir<vblex><pp><m><sg>
venir<vblex><inf>
which splits the sentence in seven lexical forms: a
multi-word adverb (por otra parte), a plural pos-
sessive determiner (m??o), a noun and an adjective
in masculine plural (amigo and americano, respec-
tively), the third-person plural form of the present
tense of the verb to be (haber), the masculine sin-
gular past participle of the verb decidir and the verb
venir in infinitive mood. Then, the transfer step is
executed. It starts by performing the lexical trans-
fer and applying the first-level rules of the structural
transfer in parallel. The lexical transfer of each SL
lexical form gives as a result:
on the other hand<adv>
my<det><pos><pl>
friend<n><pl>
american<adj>
458
have<vbhaver><pres>
decide<vblex><pp>
come<vblex><inf>
Four first-level structural transfer rules are trig-
gered: the first one matches a single adverb (the
first lexical form in the example); the second one
matches a determiner followed by an adjective and
a noun (the next three lexical forms); the third one
matches a form of the verb haber plus the past par-
ticiple form of another verb (the next two lexical
forms); and the last one matches a verb in infini-
tive mood (last lexical form). Each of these first-
level rules group the matched lexical forms in the
same chunk and perform local operations within the
chunk; for instance, the second rule reorders the ad-
jective and the noun:
ADV{ on the other hand<adv> }
NOUN_PHRASE{ my<det><pos><pl>
american<adj> friend<n><pl> }
HABER_PP{ have<vbhaver><pres>
decide<vblex><pp> }
INF{ come<vblex><inf> }
After that, inter chunk operations are performed.
The chunk sequence HABER PP (verb in present
perfect tense) INF (verb in infinitive mood) matches
a second-level rule which adds the preposition to be-
tween them:
ADV{ on the other hand<adv> }
NOUN_PHRASE{ my<det><pos><pl>
friend<n><pl> american<adj> }
HABER_PP{ have<vbhaver><pres>
decide<vblex><pp> }
TO{ to<pr> }
INF{ come<vblex><inf> }
Third-level structural transfer removes chunk en-
capsulations so that a plain sequence of lexical forms
is generated:
on the other hand<adv>
my<det><pos><pl>
american<adj>
friend<n><pl>
have<vbhaver><pres>
decide<vblex><pp>
to<pr> come<vblex><inf>
Finally, the translation into TL is generated from
the TL lexical forms: On the other hand my Ameri-
can friends have decided to come.
3 Related work
Linguistic data from RBMT have already been used
to enrich SMT systems in different ways. Bilingual
dictionaries have been added to SMT systems since
its early days (Brown et al, 1993); one of the sim-
plest strategies involves adding the dictionary entries
directly to the training parallel corpus (Tyers, 2009;
Schwenk et al, 2009). Other approaches go beyond
that. Eisele et al (2008) first translate the sentences
in the test set with an RBMT system, then apply the
usual phrase-extraction algorithm over the resulting
small parallel corpus, and finally add the obtained
phrase pairs to the original phrase table. It is worth
noting that neither of these two strategies guarantee
that the multi-word expressions in the RBMT bilin-
gual dictionary appearing in the sentences to trans-
late will be translated as such because they may be
split into smaller units by the phrase-extraction algo-
rithm. Our approach overcomes this issue by adding
the data obtained from the RBMT system directly
to the phrase table. Preliminary experiments with
Apertium data shows that our hybrid approach out-
performs the one by Eisele et al (2008) when trans-
lating Spanish texts into English.
4 Enhancing phrase-based SMT with
shallow-transfer linguistic resources
As already mentioned, the Apertium structural trans-
fer detects sequences of lexical forms which need
to be translated together to prevent them from be-
ing translated word for word, which would result in
an incorrect translation. Therefore, adding to the
phrase table of a PBSMT system all the bilingual
phrase pairs which either match one of these se-
quences of lexical forms in the structural transfer or
an entry in the bilingual dictionary suffices to encode
all the linguistic information provided by Apertium.
We add these bilingual phrase pairs directly to the
phrase table, instead of adding them to the training
corpus and rely on the phrase extraction algorithm
(Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.3), to avoid splitting the
multi-word expressions provided by Apertium into
smaller phrases (Schwenk et al, 2009, sec. 2).
4.1 Phrase pair generation
Generating the set of bilingual phrase pairs which
match bilingual dictionary entries is straightforward.
First, all the SL surface forms that are recognised by
Apertium and their corresponding lexical forms are
generated. Then, these SL lexical forms are trans-
459
lated using the bilingual dictionary, and finally their
TL surface forms are generated.
Bilingual phrase pairs which match structural
transfer rules are generated in a similar way. First,
the SL sentences to be translated are analysed to get
their SL lexical forms, and then the sequences of lex-
ical forms that either match a first-level or a second-
level structural transfer rule are passed through the
Apertium pipeline to get their translations. If a se-
quence of SL lexical forms is matched by more than
one structural transfer rule in the same level, it will
be used to generate as many bilingual phrase pairs
as different rules it matches. This differs from the
way in which Apertium translates, since in those
case only the longest rule would be applied.
The following example illustrates this procedure.
Let the Spanish sentence Por otra parte mis amigos
americanos han decidido venir, from the example
in the previous section, be one of the sentences to
be translated. The SL sequences por otra parte, mis
amigos americanos, amigos americanos, han deci-
dido, venir and han decidido venir would be used to
generate bilingual phrase pairs because they match a
first-level rule, a second-level rule, or both. The SL
words amigos americanos are used twice because
they are covered by two first-level rules: one that
matches a determiner followed by a noun and an ad-
jective, and another that matches a noun followed by
an adjective. Note that when using Apertium in the
regular way, outside this hybrid approach, only the
first rule is applied as a consequence of the left-to-
right, longest match policy. The SL words han de-
cidido and venir are used because they match first-
level rules, whereas han decidido venir matches a
second-level rule.
It is worth noting that the generation of bilin-
gual phrase pairs from the shallow-transfer rules is
guided by the test corpus. We decided to do it in
this way in order to avoid meaningless phrases and
also to make our approach computationally feasible.
Consider, for instance, the rule which is triggered
every time a determiner followed by a noun and an
adjective is detected. Generating all the possible
phrase pairs matching this rule would involve com-
bining all the determiners in the dictionary with all
the nouns and all the adjectives, causing the genera-
tion of many meaningless phrases, such as el nin?o
inala?mbrico ? the wireless boy. In addition, the
number of combinations to deal with becomes un-
manageable as the length of the rule grows.
4.2 Scoring the new phrase pairs
State-of-the-art PBSMT systems usually attach 5
scores to every phrase pair in the translation table:
source-to-target and target-to-source phrase trans-
lation probabilities, source-to-target and target-to-
source lexical weightings, and phrase penalty.
To calculate the phrase translation probabilities of
the phrase pairs obtained from the shallow-transfer
RBMT resources we simply add them once to the
list of corpus-extracted phrase pairs, and then com-
pute the probabilities by relative frequency as it is
usually done (Koehn, 2010, sec. 5.2.5). In this re-
gard, it is worth noting that, as RBMT-generated
phrase pairs are added only once, if one of them hap-
pens to share its source side with many other corpus-
extracted phrase pairs, or even with a single, very
frequent one, the RBMT-generated phrase pair will
receive lower scores, which penalises its use. To
alleviate this without adding the same phrase pair
an arbitrary amount of times, we introduce an ad-
ditional boolean score to flag phrase pairs obtained
from the RBMT resources.
The fact that the generation of bilingual phrase
pairs from shallow transfer rules is guided by the test
corpus may cause the translation of a sentence to be
influenced by other sentences in the test set. This
happens when the translation provided by Apertium
for a subsegment of a test sentence matching an
Apertium structural transfer rule is shared with one
or more subsegments in the test corpus. In that case,
the phrase translation probability p(source|target)
of the resulting bilingual phrase pair is lower than
if no subsegments with the same translation were
found.
To calculate the lexical weightings (Koehn, 2010,
sec. 5.3.3) of the RBMT-generated phrase pairs,
the alignments between the words in the source side
and those in the target side are needed. These word
alignments are obtained by tracing back the opera-
tions carried out in the different steps of the shallow-
transfer RBMT system. Only those words which
are neither split nor joint with other words by the
RBMT engine are included in the alignments; thus,
multi-word expressions are left unaligned. This is
done for convenience, since in this way multi-word

section 4.2).
expressions are assigned a lexical weighting of 1.0.
Figure 1 shows the alignment between the words in
the running example.
5 System training
We submitted a hybrid system for the Spanish?
English language pair built by following the strat-
egy described above. The initial phrase table was
built from all the parallel corpora distributed as part
of the WMT 2011 shared translation task, namely
Europarl (Koehn, 2005), News Commentary and
United Nations. In a similar way, the language
model was built from the the Europarl (Koehn,
2005) and the News Crawl monolingual English cor-
pora. The weights of the different feature functions
were optimised by means of minimum error rate
training (Och, 2003) on the 2008 test set.1 Table 1
summarises the data about the corpora used to build
our submission. We also built a baseline PBSMT
system trained on the same corpora and a reduced
version of our system whose phrase table was en-
riched only with dictionary entries.
The Apertium (Forcada et al, 2011) engine and
the linguistic resources for Spanish?English were
downloaded from the Apertium Subversion repos-
itory.The linguistic data contains 326 228 entries
in the bilingual dictionary, 106 first-level structural
transfer rules, and 31 second-level rules. As en-
tries in the bilingual dictionary contain mappings be-
tween SL and TL lemmas, when phrase pairs match-
ing the bilingual dictionary are generated all the pos-
sible inflections of these lemmas are produced.
We used the free/open-source PBSMT system
Moses (Koehn et al, 2007), together with the
IRSTLM language modelling toolkit (Federico et
al., 2008), which was used to train a 5-gram lan-

ing algorithm was chosen in order to speed-up the

Table 2 reports the translation performance
as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al,
2002), GTM (Melamed et al, 2003) and ME-
TEOR2 (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) for Apertium
and the three systems presented in the previous
section, as well as the size of the phrase table and
the amount of unknown words in the test set. The
hybrid approach outperforms the baseline PBSMT
system in terms of the three evaluation metrics.

bootstrap resampling (Zhang et al, 2004) with
a p-level of 0.05, does not overlap with zero for
any evaluation metric,3 which confirms that it is
statistically significant. Our hybrid approach also
outperforms Apertium in terms of the three eval-
uation metrics.4 However, the difference between
our complete hybrid system and the version which
only takes advantage of bilingual dictionary is not
statistically significant for any metric.5
The results show how the addition of RBMT-
generated data leads to an improvement over the
baseline PBMST system, even though it was trained
with a very large parallel corpus and the propor-
tion of entries from the Apertium data in the phrase
table is very small (0.46%). 5.94% of the phrase
pairs chosen by the decoder were generated from the
Apertium data. The improvement may be explained
by the fact that the sentences in the test set belong to
the news domain and Apertium data has been devel-
oped bearing in mind the translation of general texts
(mainly news), whereas most of the bilingual train-
ing corpus comes from specialised domains. In addi-
tion, the morphology of Spanish is quite rich, which
makes it very difficult to find all possible inflections
of the same lemma in a parallel corpus. Therefore,
Apertium-generated phrases, which contain hand-
crafted knowledge from a general domain, cover
3The confidence interval of the difference between our sys-
tem and the baseline PBSMT system for BLEU, GTM and
METEOR is [0.38, 0.93], [0.06, 0.45], and [0.06, 0.42], respec-
tively.
4The confidence interval of the difference between our
approach and Apertium for BLEU, GTM and METEOR is
[4.35, 5.35], [1.55, 2.32], and [1.50, 2.21], respectively.
5The confidence interval of the difference between our ap-
proach and the reduced version which does not use structural
transfer rules for BLEU, GTM and METEOR is [?0.07, 0.37],
[?0.06, 0.27], and [?0.06, 0.26], respectively.
some sequences of words in the input text which are
not covered, or are sparsely found, in the original
training corpora, as shown by the reduction in the
amount of unknown words (1 447 unknown words
versus 1 274). In other words, Apertium linguistic
information does not completely overlap with the
data learned from the parallel corpus. Regarding the
small difference between the hybrid system enriched
with all the Apertium resources and the one that only
includes the bilingual dictionary, preliminary exper-
iments shows that the impact of the shallow-transfer
rules is higher when the TL is highly inflected and
the SL is not, which is exactly the scenario opposite
to the one described in this paper.
7 Concluding remarks
We have presented the MT system submitted by
the Transducens Research Group from Universitat
d?Alacant to the WMT2011 shared translation task.
This is the first submission of our team to this shared
task. We developed a hybrid system for the Spanish?
English language pair which enriches the phrase ta-
ble of a standard PBSMT system with phrase pairs
generated from the RBMT linguistic resources pro-
vided by Apertium. Our system outperforms a base-
line PBSMT in terms of BLEU, GTM and METEOR
scores by a statistically significant margin.
