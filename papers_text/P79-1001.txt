Syntactic Processing

In computational linguistics, which began in the 
1950's with machine translation, systems that are 
based mainly on the lexicon have a longer t rad i t ion  
than anything e lse - - - fo r  these purposes, twenty f ive 
years must be allowed to count as a tradition. The 
bulk of many of the early translation systems was made 
up by a dict ionary whose entr ies consisted of 
arb i t rary  instruct ions In machine language. In the 
early 60's, computational llnsulsts---at least those 
with theoretical pretentlons---abandoned this way of 
doing business for at least three related reasons: 
First systems containing large amounts of unrestricted 
machine code fly in the face of ?II principles of good 
programming practice. The syntax of the language in 
which linguistic facts are stated is so remote from 
their semantics that the opportunities for error are 
very great and no assumptions can be made ?bout the 
ef fects on the system of Invoking the code associated 
wlth any given word. The systems became virtually 
unmaintainabl? and eventually fe l l  under their  own 
weight. Furthermore, these failings were magnified as 
soon as the attempt was made to impose more structure 
on the overal l  system. A general backtracking sohsme. 
for example, could ?11 too easily be thrown into 
complete disarray by an instruct ion in s s ingl ?  
d ic t ionary  entry  that affected the contro l  stack. 
Second. the power of general, and par t i cu la r ly  
nondeterminlstlc, algorithms In syntactic analysis 
came to be appreciated, i f  not overappreciated. 
Suddenly. I t  was no longer necessary to seek local  
cr i te r ia  on which to ensure the cor rectness  of 
individual decisions made by the program provided they 
were covered by more global c r i te r ia .  Separation of 
program and l ingu is t i c  data became an overriding 
pr inciple and. since i t  was most readi ly applied to 
syntactic rules, these became the maln focus of 
attent ion.  
The th i rd ,  and doubtless the most important, reason 
for the change was that syntactic theories in which ? 
grammar was seen as consisting of ? set of rules. 
preferably including transformational rules, captured 
the Imagination of the most i n f luent ia l  
nonoomputational l ingu is ts ,  and computational 
l inguists  followed suite i f  only to maintain 
theoretical respsotablllty. In short, Systems with 
small sets of rules in ? constrained formalism and 
simple lex lca l  entr ies apparently made for simpler. 
cleaner, and more powerful programs while sett ing the 
whole enterprise on a sounder theoret ical  footing. 
The trend is now In the opposite d i rect ion.  There has 
been a sh i f t  of  emphasis away from highly structured 
systems of complex rules as the pr inciple repository 
of Information ?bout the syntax of ? language towards 
? view In which the responsib i l i ty  ia d istr ibuted 
among the lexicon, semantic parts of the l ingu is t i c  
descript ion, and ? cognitive or strategic component, 
Concomitantly. Interest  has shifted from algorithms 
for syntactic analysis and generation, tn which the 
control structure and the exact sequence of events are 
paramount, to systems in which ? heavier burden Is 
carried by the data structure and in which the order 
o~ events is ? matter of strategy. This new trend is 
? common thread running through several of  the papers 
in this section, 
Various techniques for syntactic analysis, not ?s ly 
those based on some form of Augmented Transit ion 
Network (ATN). represent grammatical facts In terms of 
executabl? machine code. The danger? to which thin 
exposed the ear l ie r  system? ? r ?  avoided by ln~i~tinR 
that th is  code by compiled from 8tat?ments in a 
torm?llsm that allows only for lingutsticaJly 
motivated operations on carefully controlled parts of 
certain data structures. 
The value of nondeterminl?t ic procedures is 
undlmlni?hed, but it has become clear that It does not 
rest on complex control structures and a rigidly 
determined sequence of events. In discussing the 
syntactic processors that we have developed, for 
example, Ron Kaplan and I no longer flnd it useful te 
talk in terms of a parsing algorithm. There ?re two 
central data structures, a chart and ?n agenda. When 
additions tO the chart slve rise to certain kinds of 
configurations in which some element cont ? t ,s  
executable code, ? task is created and placed on the 
? good?. Tasks are removed from the agenda and 
executed in an order determined by strategic 
considerations which const i tute part cf  the l ingu is t i c  
theory. Strategy can determine only the order in 
which a l ternat ive analyses are produced. ~any 
t rad i t iona l  d is t inct ions ,  such as that between top- 
down and bottom-up processing, no longer apply to the 
procedure as a whole but only to partlcuisr strategies 
or the i r  parts. 
Thls looser or|snlzatlon of programs for syntactic 
processing came. at least in pert.  from e generally 
fe l t  need to break down the boundaries that had 
traditionally separated morphological, syntactic, and 
semantic processes. Research dlrectad towards speech 
understanding systems was quite unable to r?spent 
these boundaries because, in the face of unc , r ta i r  
data. local  moves in the analysis on one lever 
required confirmation from other levels so that s 
common data structure for ?II levels of  analysis and ? 
schedule that could change continual ly were of the 
eseenoe. Puthermore. there was a mouvement from 
within the ar t i f i c ia l - in te l l igence  community to 
eliminate the boundaries because, frnm that 
perspective, they lacked su f f i c ient  theoret ical  
Jus t i f i ca t ion .  
Zn speech research In part icu lar ,  and ar t i f i c ia l  
Inte l l igence in general, the lexicon took on an 
important Position i f  only because i t  la th,~-~e that 
the units or meaning reside. Recent pro ..sols t ,  
l ingu is t i c  theory involve s larger role for the 
lexicon. Eresnan (1978) has argued persuasively that 
the fu l l  mechanism of transformational rules can. and 
should, be dispensed with except in cases Of Uhbountte~
