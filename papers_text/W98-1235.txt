The Total Turing Test and the Loebner Prize

Abstract 
The Loebner Prize is the first, and only regular, 
competition based on the Turing Test, but in order to 
stage the competition various modifications to the 
original test have been made. In particular, the Grand 
Prize has a controversial nd as yet undefined Audio- 
Visual condition attached toit. This paper discusses the 
value of the test with and without the A/V condition, and 
makes a proposal about what he general nature of the 
A/V test should be. 
1. Introduction and Motivation 
The Turing Test has always been controversial, and has 
been a continuing topic in AI journals and discussions 
since well before the Loebner Prize. We, however, will 
not pick up the story till after the first Loebner Prize 
competition was held, since this sparked a number of 
critical articles in both the general and the specialist 
media, including AI Magazine, The Economist, and 
multiple treatments in each of SIGART Bulletin (e.g. 
3#4, 4#I, 4#4, 6#4) and CACM (Wilkes, 1992; Shieber, 
1994; Loebner, 1994;. 
As Harnad (in a SIGART Editorial and Commentary, 
1992) puts it, Turing's insight is that we can discern the 
intelligence of a lifelong pen pal without ever meeting 
him, but the Eliza and Party experience suggest that it is 
too easy to trick the computer, and Shapiro points out the 
importance of knowing that you may be talking to the 
computer. Our default 'charitable assumption' is that we 
are talking to 'a person like us'. 
Even in a special issue on an apparently unrelated 
controversy, the connectionism/symbolism debate, the 
issues relating to the representation f knowledge merge 
in with the debate about he nature ofintellegence and the 
Turing Test (Powers, 1993). The issue of Symbol 
Grounding is the bridge, and Hamad in particular has 
devoted considerable attention to this in bothof these 
forums and elsewhere (e.g. 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 
1992), and it is alsothe issue you I wish to focus on here. 
I will therefore ignore the questions as to whether the 
Turing Test promotes dishonesty or the Loebner Prize 
promotes tricks, and focus on the issue ofwbetber robot- 
like interaction with the world is necessary to pass the 
Taring Test, and how the Loebner Prize should 
implement the Audio-Visual component of the Grand 
Prize which Loebner added in the face of the criticisms 
that the Turing Test was too shallow (Shieber, 1994; 
Loebner, 1994). 
2. Symbol Ground and the TTT  
The problem with Natural Language Processing today is 
that it tends to amount to translation between formalisms 
without understanding. The original criticisms of the 
Loebner Prize, and earlier the Turing Test, focus on the 
fact that Eliza-style 'parrying' involves no understanding 
but can still fool the unitiated for short periods of time in 
highly constrained circumstances (e.g. where they have 
been led to believe the program is a doctor or a patient). 
The converse of this is the claim that nothing better 
than this kind of translation and reflection, albeit in 
increasingly sophisticated forms, can be achieved by a 
computer that has no connection with reality. Even an 
encyclopaedia h s pictures, and a dictionary assumes a 
basic vocabulary and understanding based on a lowest 
common denominator form of basic human experience 
and language capability. Hamad (1990) calls this the 
symbol grounding problem, and claims that it will not be 
possible to pass an unrestricted Taring Test without 
symbol grounding - that is our symbols, or words, need to 
have some connection to a sensory-motor experience of 
the world. Thus a computer system capable of passing the 
Turing Test would have to be more like a robot capable of 
passing the Total Turing Test, in which behaviour in 
interaction with the world must be the same. 
This is the reason that Loebner (1994) felt constrained 
to place an Audio-Visual condition on the Grand Prize. 
The very first winner of the annual Loebner Prize, fooled 
half the judges in a restricted Turing Test (and a carefully 
chosen domain, "whimsical conversation"), but fell far 
short of exhibiting intelligence or of providing a 
convincing performance to those familiar with Eliza and 
the standard tricks. There was no evidence of 
understanding, and according to the symbol grounding 
principle there was not possibility of understanding. One 
way to ensure that systems are grounded is to move to a 
version of the Total Turing Test by adding in a Audio- 
Visual requirement which has not yet been fully defined, 
and has served to create another controversy. 
Powers 279 Turing Test and LoebnerPrize 
David M. W. Powers (1998) The Total Turing Test and the Loebner Prize. In D.M.W. Powers (ed.) NeMLaP3/CoNLL98 
Workshop on Human Computer Conversation, ACL, pp 279-280. 
There are two main reasons for this: one is that not all 
agree that grounding is necessary, and the other is that it 
is no longer the Turing Test as defined by Turing. On the 
other hand we have a solid hypothesis. IfHarnad is fight, 
the first program to pass the TT should be able to pass the 
TTT. I fHamad is wrong, there are likely to be some years 
between the passing of the TT and the passing of the TTT. 
3. Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals 
To address this, Loebner has agreed to provide three 
levels ofpfizes, initially $100,000, $25,000 and $2,000, 
and corresponding Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals for 
the Grand Prize Winner, Turing Test Winner and Annual 
Prize Winners, respectively. The Silver Medal will be 
awarded for the straight Turing Test, whilst the Gold 
Medal and Grand Prize are for a version of the Total 
Turing Test. 
Note that he prize is now awarded by a panel of judges 
of which 50% are experts in AI - which will mean Eliza- 
like tricks will not suffice to win the Silver Medal. The 
AN version of the test will be run separately, with only 
programs capable of fooling 50% of the judges being 
eligible. The remainder of this paper discusses a proposal 
for the AN condition to be used for the Grand Prize 
competition. 
4. Show and Tell 
Let's go back to kindergarten for a moment. Remember 
when you had to bring in a favorite object, show it to your 
classmates, and talk about what was so special about it. 
This is the basic concept. 
Now let's consider some possible Loebner Prize 
entries. Some may have robot arms and cameras; some 
may have speech recognition and synthesis capabilities 
along with a broader range of auditory capabilities. 
Now let's consider some possible Loebner Prize 
confederates. Some intelligent people have disabilities 
and lack arms or vision; some may be deaf or have no 
musical ability, but they will have a range of other senses 
open to them. 
The aim of the Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 
is not to test entrants' auditory or visual acuity, but rather 
their ability to take in information from and interact with 
their environment, to deal with it in an intelligent way, 
and to discuss it in a way that is indistinguishable from a 
human participant - -  allowing for the fact that some 
humans may be deaf or blind. 
Part of the purpose of the Loebner Prize is to provide 
an understanding ofwhat it is that distinguishes a human 
from a computer, natural intelligence from artificial 
intelligence. Another aspect is to understand what it is 
that leads us to decide that a person, or a computer, is 
intelligent, and to wean ourselves away from the 
superficial accidental features which might distract from 
this focus on intelligence. For this reason, the current 
organizers of the Loebner Prize competition aim to 
include a confederate or a judge with some kind of 
disability each year. We aim for it to be representative of 
a broader class of people, both in the general population 
and in the scientific community. If the computer can't 
see, does that mean that a blind person may be confused 
more easily with a computer, or that a computer may be 
more easily confused with a blind person? 
Giving the participant an object allows them to make 
use of whatever sensory-motor capabilities they have, 
and shouldn't bias against any particular disabilities. I f  
you hand a deaf-person a musical instrument, or a CD 
and CD-player, they can tell you they are deaf, but still 
appreciate the objects per se and demonstrate their 
intelligence in terms of their understanding of the use or 
function of the object(s). 
5. Discussion 
This paper is intended to lead to discussion of this and 
other possibilities for the implementation f the Loebner 
Prize AN condition. We have shown that it is closely 
related to the Total Turing Test, and that there is a 
siguifieant empirical question to be answered in relation 
to whether it is or is not effectively a stronger test han the 
standard Turing Test.
