Abstract
This paper investigates two strategies for
collecting readability assessments, an Ex-
pert Readers application intended to collect
fine-grained readability assessments from lan-
guage experts and a Sort by Readability ap-
plication designed to be intuitive and open for
everyone having internet access. We show
that the data sets resulting from both annota-
tion strategies are very similar. We conclude
that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to
the opinions of language experts for readabil-
ity prediction.
1 Introduction
The task of automatically determining the readabil-
ity of texts has a long and rich tradition. This has not
only resulted in a large number of readability formu-
las (Flesch, 1948; Brouwer, 1963; Dale and Chall,
1948; Gunning, 1952; McLaughlin, 1969), but also
to the more recent tendency of using insights from
NLP for automatic readability prediction (Schwarm
and Ostendorf, 2005; Collins-Thompson and Callan,
2004; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008). Potential appli-
cations include the selection of reading material for
language learners, automatic essay scoring, the se-
lection of online text material for automatic summa-
rization, etc.
One of the well-known bottlenecks in data-driven
NLP research is the lack of sufficiently large data
sets for which annotators provided labels with suffi-
cient agreement. Also readability research is faced
with the crucial obstacle that very few corpora of
generic texts exist of which reliable readability in-
formation is available (Tanaka-Ishii et al, 2010).
When constructing such a corpus, the inherent sub-
jectivity of the concept of readability cannot be ig-
nored. The ease with which a given reader can
correctly identify the message conveyed in a text
is, among other things, inextricably related to the
reader?s background knowledge of the subject at
hand (McNamara et al, 1993). The construction of
a corpus, which can serve as a gold standard against
which new scoring or ranking systems can be tested,
thus requires a multifaceted approach taking into ac-
count both the properties of the text under evaluation
and those of the readers. In recent years, a tendency
seems to have arisen to also explicitly address this
subjective aspect of readability. Pitler and Nenkova
(2008), for example, base their readability predic-
tion method exclusively on the extent to which read-
ers found a text to be ?well-written? and Kate et al
(2010) take the assessments supplied by a number
of experts as their gold standard, and test their read-
ability prediction method as well as assessments by
novices against these expert opinions.
In this paper, we report on two methodologies
to construct a corpus of readability assessments,
which can serve as a gold standard against which
new scoring or ranking systems can be tested. Both
methodologies were used for collecting readabil-
ity assessments of Dutch and English texts. Since
these data collection experiments for English only
recently started, the focus in this paper will be on
120
Dutch. By collecting multiple assessments per text,
the goal was to level out the reader?s background
knowledge and attitude. We will both report on
a data collection experiment designed for language
experts and a simple crowdsourcing experiment.
We will introduce inter-annotator agreement and
calculate K scores in different settings. We will
show that from the two readability assessment appli-
cations, two very similar data sets are obtained, with
calculations of Pearson correlations of at least 87 %,
and conclude that the simple crowdsourcing results
are a viable alternative to the assessments resulting
from expert labelings.
In section 2, we describe the data from language
experts and how those data can be converted to rela-
tive assessments. Section 3 outlines a simpler crow-
sourcing application and its correspondences with
the experts. Finally, in section 4, we draw conclu-
sions and give a short summary of future work.
2 Readability assessment by the expert
reader
Since readability prediction was initially primarily
designed to identify reading material suited to the
reading competence of a given individual, most of
the existing data sets are drawn from textbooks and
other sources intended for different compentence
levels (Franc?ois, 2009; Heilman et al, 2008). For
Dutch, for example, the only large-scale experi-
mental readability research (Staphorsius and Krom,
1985; Staphorsius, 1994) is limited to texts for el-
ementary school children.1 For English, the situa-
tion is similar as for Dutch, viz. a predominant focus
on educational corpora. Recently, an evaluation was
designed by LDC in the framework of the DARPA
Machine Reading Program (Kate et al, 2010). For
this purpose a more general corpus was assembled
which was not tailored to a specific audience, genre
or domain. Unfortunately, the data are not available
for further use. Our research focus is similar and we
report on the collection of readability assessments
1Staphorsius (1994), for instance, who conducted the only
large-scale experimental readability research in the Dutch-
speaking regions, based his research entirely on cloze-testing. A
cloze-test is a reading comprehension test introduced by Rankin
(1959) in which test subjects are required to fill in automatically
deleted words in an unseen text. It is unclear whether such tasks
are actually suitable to estimate the readability of a text.
for a corpus of Dutch text, which will be used for
training and evaluating a readability prediction sys-
tem.
2.1 Source data
In order to acquire useful data for the construction of
a gold standard, we implemented the Expert Read-
ers application intended for language experts. The
texts for the application were chosen from the Lassy
corpus (van Noord, 2009), which is syntactically an-
notated, and which is currently being enhanced with
several layers of semantic annotations (Schuurman
et al, 2009). These annotations will allow us in the
future to determine the impact of various semantic,
syntactic and pragmatic factors on text readability.
The small subcorpus consists of 105 texts of be-
tween about 100 and 200 words. Most of the texts
are extracted from a larger context, but all are mean-
ingful by themselves. All texts are in Dutch and
most of them originate from Wikipedia or newspa-
pers. Further, the corpus contains parts of domain-
specific and official documents, manuals, patient in-
formation leaflets and others. The texts in the sub-
corpus have no readability levels assigned, but they
are carefully selected in order to obtain texts with a
multitude of readability levels. Because of the lack
of a prior readability assessment, the selection was
purely based on careful, yet intuitive judgment.
2.2 Application set-up
The Expert Readers application2 is designed to col-
lect readability assessments from language experts.
They can express their opinion by ranking texts on
a scale of 0 (easy) to 100 (difficult), which allows
them to compare the texts with each other while
at the same time assigning absolute scores. These
fine-grained assessments committed by experts are
grouped into submission batches, holding a num-
ber of texts which have been ranked and to which
a score has been assigned. For each submitted text,
we know who sent it when, with which score and
along with which other texts in the same submission
batch. The experts can also make use of a so-called
frame of reference, in which texts are kept avail-
able over different submission batches. The same

121
text can occur only once per batch, but can be pre-
sented again to the same expert in other batches.
Apart from the readability scores and the rankings
in the batches, the experts can also enter comments
on what makes each text more or less readable.
That allows for qualitative analysis. We did not
ask more detailed questions about certain aspects
of readability, because we wanted to avoid influenc-
ing the text properties experts pay attention to. Nei-
ther did we inform the experts in any way how they
should judge readability. Any presumption about
which features are important readability indicators
was thus avoided. Our main interest is to design a
system that is robust enough to model readability as
generally as possible.
In the context of our experiments, we regard peo-
ple as language experts if they are native readers pro-
fessionally involved with the Dutch language. Our
current pool of active experts consists of 34 teach-
ers, writers and linguists, who have contributed a to-
tal of 1862 text scores over 108 submission batches.
The experts were all volunteers and were not paid
for their work. Their instructions consisted of an ex-
planation of how the application works on paper and
an instruction movie of a couple of minutes. The
sizes of the submission batches range from 5 to all
available texts. Batches with less than 5 texts were
omitted from the data.
2.3 Text scores converted to text pairs
The Expert Readers application provided a rich, but
highly fine-grained output. At first sight, a straight-
forward and intuitive way to work with the Expert
Readers data would be to use, for example, the mean
readability score assigned to each text. Pitler and
Nenkova (2008) and Kate et al (2010), for example,
average out results collected from different readers.
However, problems with this approach immediately
arise. Results from Anderson and Davison (1986),
for example, show for their data set that if the data
on which readability formulas are based, were not
aggregated on the school grade level but considered
at the individual level, their predictive power would
drop from around 80% to an estimated 10%.
We observed a similar tendency in the results of
the expert readers application: Figure 1 illustrates
that different experts employ different standards to
assign readability scores to texts. Being given the

Figure 1: Different scoring strategies for a subset of ex-
perts, showing all text scores aggregated across batches
choice to label texts with marks between 0 and
100, some annotators decided to use a more coarse-
grained labeling strategy (e.g. by using multiples of
10 or 20), whereas others used a fine-grained scoring
(all marks between 0 and 100). Furthermore, some
people seem to be reluctant to assign either high or
low scores, or both, while some others use the full
range of possible scores.
Moreover, the experts delivered their data in sev-
eral batches. The texts presented in each submis-
sion batch were selected randomly, which implies
that the annotator could have been confronted with
predominantly less readable or predominantly more
readable texts, which may have affected his scoring.
Furthermore, since each text being added to a
batch makes it increasingly difficult for an annota-
tor to position this text to the already scored texts,
we can assume that the greater the number of texts
in a batch, the more effort the annotator did to posi-
tion each text correctly in the batch. We decided to
only take into account submission batches in which
at least 5 texts were compared to each other. Figure 2
clearly shows the variability in the scores assigned to
the texts.
There is by no means a notion of a single statis-
tical distribution that allows for a useful interpre-
tation of the means of the scores. Since it is far
from trivial to use the absolute scores assigned by
the experts, we transformed their assessments to a
relative scale. A resulting text pair then consists

median, third quantile, the maximum and the outliers for
the scores assigned to each text
of two texts, accompanied with an assessment that
designates which of the two texts is easier than the
other one, and to what degree. The identification
of text pairs is straightforward, since in each batch,
each pair of distinct texts presents a text pair, leading
to n?(n?1)2 pairs per batch. For the transformation
from the position of the texts in a batch to a relative
assessment for each text pair, we need to fit the batch
size and number of texts scored in between two texts
in the same batch to a measure that indicates the dif-
ference in readability between two texts. In order to
do so, a possible formula to map the significance of
the difference in readability is the following:
S =
(
t
B
)2
?
(
1? exp
(
?
B

))
in which S is the significance of the difference in
readability, B is the batch size and t is the number
of texts scored in between two texts.
The quadratic function
(
t
B
)2
in the first factor ex-
presses that, in order to achieve a greater signifi-
cance, the value of t must be more than proportion-
ally higher. Because of the quadratic function, more
texts must be scored in between two texts in order to
get a higher significance estimate. If the quadratic
part would be the only factor, the two outer texts
in each batch would always get the highest possible
significance estimate. However, the second factor,

ensures that small batches are less

3 From the expert to the crowd
Based on the assumption that the readability of a
text can be conceptualized as the extent to which the
text is perceived to be readable by the community
of language users, we also investigated whether a
crowdsourcing approach could be a viable alterna-
tive to expert labeling. Crowdsourcing has already
been used with success for NLP applications such as
WSD (Snow et al, 2008) or anaphora resolution3.
By redesigning readability assessment as a crowd-
sourcing application, we hypothesize that no back-
ground in linguistics is required to judge the read-
ability of a given text. The Sort by Readability ap-
plication4 is designed as a simple crowdsourcing ap-
plication to be used by as many users as possible.
The site is accessible to anyone having internet ac-
cess and very inutitive; the users are not required to
provide personal data. A screenshot of the crowd-
sourcing application is shown in Figure 5.
Two texts are displayed simultaneously and the
user is asked to tick one of the following statements
?Left: much more difficult ? Right: much easier?,
?Left: somewhat more difficult ? Right: somewhat
easier?, ?Both equally difficult?, ?Left: somewhat
easier ? Right: somewhat more difficult?, ?Left:
much easier Right: much more difficult?. The as-
sessments were performed on the same data set that
was used for the Expert readers application. The re-
spondents were not paid for their work and initially
recruited among friends and students. The only in-
structions they were given were the following two
sentences on the landing page of the application:
Using this tool, you can help us compose
a readability corpus. You are shown two
texts of which you can decide which is the
more difficult and which is the easier one.
We assume that most respondents are native speak-
ers of the Dutch language.
At the time of writing, 8568 comparisons were
performed.

4The Sort by Readability application can be accessed
through the following link: http://lt3.hogent.be/
tools/sort-by-readability-nl/.
Figure 6: The number of times each button is pressed
in the Sort by Readability application. The buttons from
left to right are LME (?Left: much easier ? Right: much
more difficult?), LSE (?Left: somewhat easier ? Right:
somewhat more difficult?), ED (?Both equally difficult?),
RSE (?Left: somewhat more difficult ? Right: somewhat
easier?) and RME (?Left: much more difficult ? Right:
much easier?).
The number of times each button in the crowd-
sourcing application was pressed is displayed in Fig-
ure 6. The number of times the text on the left was
found easier is almost exactly the same as the num-
ber of times for the right one. That means that users
of the crowdsourcing application are generally not
biased towards finding texts on one side easier than
on the other side. Most of the times two texts were
compared, people found that there was a difference
in readability. Only in 28.2% of the cases, people as-
sessed both texts as equally difficult. In 53.6% of the
cases, the crowd assigned a slight difference in read-
ability and in 18.2%, the readability was assessed as
very different. Note that not everyone evaluated the
same text pairs. Moreover, nobody evaluated all the
possible text pairs.
Figure 7 shows for both the Expert readers and
Sort by Readability application the relationship be-
tween the proportions with which each text is as-
sessed as easier (both much and somewhat easier),
equally readable or more difficult (both much and
somewhat more difficult) than any other text. In
all scatter plots, the texts occur in a sickle-shaped
form. The plots for both data sets look very simi-
lar, but there is less variability for the Expert Read-

ers data. That may indicate that the Expert Readers
application actually helps people to provide assess-
ments more consistently than the Sort by Readability
application. Despite these small variations, we can
conclude that from the two readability assessment
applications, two very similar data sets are obtained.
3.1 Inter-annotator agreement
For most NLP tasks, there is a tradition to calculate
some measure of inter-annotator agreement (IAA).
If this measure is high enough, the data are deemed
acceptable to serve as a gold standard. If not, the un-
derlying annotation guidelines can be adapted or fur-
ther specified in order to improve the future agree-
ment between annotators. In readability research,
however, this practice does not seem to have gained
much ground. Given that many readability pre-
diction methods (e.g. (Flesch, 1948; Staphorsius,
1994)) were developed before it became common-
place, it is not surprising that inter-annotator agree-
ment played no great part in the development of
those readability formulas. However, also in the
more recent classification-based work on readability
prediction, we are not aware of such efforts. Deter-
mining inter-annotator agreement for both our an-
notation tasks is far from trivial. In both appli-
cations, not all texts received an equal number of
assessments, as shown in Figures 8 and 9. Since
this evidently leads to a varying number of assess-
ments per text pair (ranging from 1 to 25 for Expert
Readers and from 1 to 8 for Sort by Readability),
we took this into account in the calculation of the
inter-annotator agreement. Further, our definition
of readability does not allow annotation guidelines.
We explicitly avoided to influence people on what
their view on readability should be, because we as-
sume that their collective view is what defines the
readability of a given text. Annotation guidelines
would make the definition recursive. Inter-annotator
agreement is therefore implemented as a descriptive
statistic. It is not used to further guide the annotation
process.
We calculated the IAA both for the text pairs from
the Sort by Readability application and the mapped
text pairs resulting from the Expert Readers data. To
convert the significance levels of the Expert Read-

data sets. The only possible alternative would be to

Figure 9: Distribution of the number of sessions each text

Readability application5 on the Expert Readers data
set, leads to the boundary values displayed as dashed
lines in Figure 4. 28 % of the text pairs in both ap-
plications are thus labeled as equally readable, while
18 % of the pairs are labeled with much difference in
difficulty. Those partitions correspond with bound-
ary values of 0.016 and 0.29 for S, respectively.
We used K as proposed by Carletta (1996) as a
measure for the agreement between annotators. K
is given by the following formula:
K =
P (A)? P (E)
1? P (E)
in which P (A) is the probability that two annotators
make the same decision and P (E) is the probabil-
ity that the same decision is made coincidently. For
P (A), we take into account the number of times two
annotators agree about a text pair and the number of
times they disagree. The trivial case, when there is
total agreement, simply because a text pair is anno-
tated only once, was not taken into account for the
calculation of the kappa statistic. P (E) is empiri-
cally estimated in the standard way.
We calculate K in 5 different settings. In the stan-
dard setting, each of the five possible assessments
for a text in a text pair is regarded as a separate class,
without ordering of the classes.
In a second calculation of inter-annotator agree-
ment, we considered a click on an adjacent button
5See Figure 6
for the same text pair as agreement. By doing so,
we took into account that the choice between ?eas-
ier? and ?much easier? and between ?more diffi-
cult? ?much more difficult? , respectively, is less
straightforward than the distinction between ?eas-
ier? and ?more difficult?. Furthermore, the bound-
ary between ?both equally difficult? and ?somewhat
easier/more difficult? could also be considered less
transparent.
In a third calculation, named merged, the classes
?easier? and ?much easier? on one hand, and ?more
difficult? and ?much more difficult? on the other
hand are merged, resulting in three different classes.
Finally, we examine two cases in which a part of
the text pairs are omitted, viz. no same and much
difference. In both cases, a binary classification is
performed. P (E) now equals 0.5 for both classes,
because there are two possible outcomes, with equal
probability. For no same, the button in the mid-
dle was discarded. The ?easier? and ?much easier?
classes were merged, as well as the ?more difficult?
and ?much more difficult? classes. In the much dif-
ference setting, only the texts labeled as much easier
or much more difficult were taken into account.
The results of all these calculations are shown in
Table 1. The second column indicates a range of a
number of text pairs, which determines how many
times a text pair must have been labeled in order
to be taken into account for the calculation of K.
The results are variable, depending on how K was
calculated. For the Expert Readers, we consistently
observe higher K values when more labelings are
required per text pair.
One possibility to get an idea of how similar the
two data sets are is by calculating correlation met-
rics, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient. In
order to calculate that, a numerical value acquired
from both data sets must be attached to each text.
For each text, we attached two values per data set,
viz. the proportions of times the text was assessed
either as easier or as more difficult than any other
text. The correlations between the 4 resulting values
per text are shown in Table 2. From those results, it
is clear that the data sets are very similar.
There are different viable alternatives to construct
a gold standard from the data sets. The type of gold
standard that is needed depends on the learning task
to be performed. For regression, for example, the
127

Crowd ? more difficult -93 % 100 % -87 % 89 %

Experts ? more difficult -87 % 89 % -99 % 100 %
Table 2: Pearson correlations between 4 different metrics calculated based on the assessments by experts or the crowd.
The metrics are the proportions of times a text is assessed either as easier or as more difficult than any other text.
most suitable gold standard consists of an assign-
ment of a readability score to each individual text.
Those readability scores can for example be the pro-
portion of times each text was assessed as easier than
any other text. Other possibilities to assign scores
can also lead to a gold standard for regression. Bi-
nary classification is an example of a different learn-
ing task, for which the data set doesn?t need to be
transformed. For two texts, a binary classifier at-
tempts to determine which is the easiest and which
the most difficult one. Further research will focus
on how the data sets resulting from both annotation
strategies can be transformed into gold standards.
4 Concluding remarks
We have implemented two web applications to col-
lect assessments about the readability of texts in a
selected corpus: an application intended for lan-
guage experts and a crowdsourcing tool. Although
both English and Dutch are targeted, we focused on
the results that were obtained for Dutch. In order
to compare the resulting readability assessments, we
viewed the data as text pairs, for which a relative as-
sessment is given. A comparison of both data sets
revealed that they are very similar, a similarity which
was numerically confirmed by an analysis with Pear-
son?s correlation coefficient. Finally, we gave ex-
amples of how gold standards for different learning
tasks canbe constructed from the data sets.
We introduced the problem of inter-annotator
agreement into the field of readability prediction and
calculated inter-annotator agreement for both data
sets in five different ways. We show that for the
text pairs which were assessed > 10 times, higher
K scores are obtained in each of the different set-
tings, which strengthens our confidence that read-
ability can be learned from our data sets.
We conclude that both data sets are valuable and
that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to read-
ability assessments by language experts.
Future work includes a further extension and anal-
ysis of the data sets. Further analysis could also re-
veal the ideal way to extract a gold standard from the
data sets. We will also continue to investigate the
impact of different linguistic features on automatic
readability prediction (van Oosten et al, 2010).
