Abstract
Many current Natural Language Process-
ing [NLP] techniques work well assum-
ing a large context of text as input data.
However they become ineffective when
applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds.
To overcome the issue, we want to find
a related newswire document to a given
tweet to provide contextual support for
NLP tasks. This requires robust model-
ing and understanding of the semantics of
short texts.
The contribution of the paper is two-fold:
1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-to-
News task as well as a dataset of linked
tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many
NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ-
ous research which focuses on lexical fea-
tures within the short texts (text-to-word
information), we propose a graph based
latent variable model that models the in-
ter short text correlations (text-to-text in-
formation). This is motivated by the ob-
servation that a tweet usually only cov-
ers one aspect of an event. We show that
using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and
news specific feature (named entities) as
well as temporal constraints, we are able to
extract text-to-text correlations, and thus
completes the semantic picture of a short
text. Our experiments show significant im-
provement of our new model over base-
lines with three evaluation metrics in the
new task.
1 Introduction
Recently there has been an increasing interest in
language understanding of Twitter messages. Re-
searchers (Speriosui et al, 2011; Brody and Di-
akopoulos, 2011; Jiang et al, 2011) were in-
terested in sentiment analysis on Twitter feeds,
and opinion mining towards political issues or
politicians (Tumasjan et al, 2010; Conover et al,
2011). Others (Ramage et al, 2010; Jin et al,
2011) summarized tweets using topic models. Al-
though these NLP techniques are mature, their
performance on tweets inevitably degrades, due to
the inherent sparsity in short texts. In the case
of sentiment analysis, while people are able to
achieve 87.5% accuracy (Maas et al, 2011) on a
movie review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004), the
performance drops to 75% (Li et al, 2012) on
a sentence level movie review dataset (Pang and
Lee, 2005). The problem worsens when some
existing NLP systems cannot produce any results
given the short texts. Considering the following
tweet:
Pray for Mali...
A typical event extraction/discovery system (Ji
and Grishman, 2008) fails to discover the war
event due to the lack of context information (Ben-
son et al, 2011), and thus fails to shed light on the
users focus/interests.
To enable the NLP tools to better understand
Twitter feeds, we propose the task of linking a
tweet to a news article that is relevant to the tweet,
thereby augmenting the context of the tweet. For
example, we want to supplement the implicit con-
text of the above tweet with a news article such as
the following entitled:
State of emergency declared in Mali
where abundant evidence can be fed into an off-
the-shelf event extraction/discovery system. To
create a gold standard dataset, we download tweets
spanning over 18 days, each with a url linking to a
news article of CNN or NYTIMES, as well as all
the news of CNN and NYTIMES published during
the period. The goal is to predict the url referred
news article based on the text in each tweet.1 We

believe many NLP tasks will benefit from this task.
In fact, in the topic modeling research, previous
work (Jin et al, 2011) already showed that by in-
corporating webpages whose urls are contained
in tweets, the tweet clustering purity score was
boosted from 0.280 to 0.392.
Given the few number of words in a tweet (14
words on average in our dataset), the traditional
high dimensional surface word matching is lossy
and fails to pinpoint the news article. This con-
stitutes a classic short text semantics impediment
(Agirre et al, 2012). Latent variable models are
powerful by going beyond the surface word level
and mapping short texts into a low dimensional
dense vector (Socher et al, 2011; Guo and Diab,
2012b). Accordingly, we apply a latent variable
model, namely, the Weighted Textual Matrix Fac-
torization [WTMF] (Guo and Diab, 2012b; Guo
and Diab, 2012c) to both the tweets and the news
articles. WTMF is a state-of-the-art unsupervised
model that was tested on two short text similar-
ity datasets: (Li et al, 2006) and (Agirre et al,
2012), which outperforms Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis [LSA] (Landauer et al, 1998) and Latent
Dirichelet Allocation [LDA] (Blei et al, 2003) by
a large margin. We employ it as a strong baseline
in this task as it exploits and effectively models the
missing words in a tweet, in practice adding thou-
sands of more features for the tweet, by contrast
LDA, for example, only leverages observed words
(14 features) to infer the latent vector for a tweet.
Apart from the data sparseness, our dataset pro-
poses another challenge: a tweet usually covers
only one aspect of an event. In our previous ex-
ample, the tweet only contains the location Mali
while the event is about French army participated
in Mali war. In this scenario, we would like to find
the missing elements of the tweet such as French,
war from other short texts, to complete the seman-
tic picture of Pray in Mali tweet. One drawback
of WTMF for our purposes is that it simply mod-
els the text-to-word information without leverag-
ing the correlation between short texts. While
this is acceptable on standard short text similarity
datasets (data points are independently generated),
it ignores some valuable information characteristi-
cally present in our dataset: (1) The tweet specific
features such as hashtags. Hashtags prove to be
a direct indication of the semantics of tweets (Ra-
mage et al, 2010); (2) The news specific features
columbia.edu/?weiwei
such as named entities in a document. Named en-
tities acquired from a news document, typically
with high accuracy using Named Entity Recog-
nition [NER] tools, may be particularly informa-
tive. If two texts mention the same entities then
they might describe the same event; (3) The tem-
poral information in both genres (tweets and news
articles). We note that there is a higher chance
of event description overlap between two texts if
their time of publication is similar.
In this paper, we study the problem of min-
ing and exploiting correlations between texts us-
ing these features. Two texts may be considered
related or complementary if they share a hash-
tag/NE or satisfies the temporal constraints. Our
proposed latent variable model not only models
text-to-word information, but also is aware of the
text-to-text information (illustrated in Figure 1):
two linked texts should have similar latent vec-
tors, accordingly the semantic picture of a tweet is
completed by receiving semantics from its related
tweets. We incorporate this additional information
in the WTMF model. We also show the differ-
ent impact of the text-to-text relations in the tweet
genre and news genre. We are able to achieve sig-
nificantly better results than with a text-to-words
WTMF model. This work can be regarded as a
short text modeling approach that extends previ-
ous work however with a focus on combining the
mining of information within short texts coupled
with utilizing extra shared information across the
short texts.
2 Task and Data
The task is given the text in a tweet, a system aims
to find the most relevant news article. For gold
standard data, we harvest all the tweets that have a
single url link to a CNN or NYTIMES news arti-
cle, dated from the 11th of Jan to the 27th of Jan,
2013. In evaluation, we consider this url-referred
news article as the gold standard ? the most rele-
vant document for the tweet, and remove the url
from the text of the tweet. We also collect all the
news articles from both CNN and NYTIMES from
RSS feeds during the same timeframe. Each tweet
entry has the published time, author, text; each
news entry contains published time, title, news
summary, url. The tweet/news pairs are extracted
by matching urls. We manually filtered ?trivial?
tweets where the tweet content is simply the news
title or news summary. The final dataset results in

34,888 tweets and 12,704 news articles.
It is worth noting that the news corpus is not
restricted to current events. It covers various gen-
res and topics, such as travel guides. e.g. World?s
most beautiful lakes, and health issues, e.g. The
importance of a ?stop day?, etc.
2.1 Evaluation metric
For our task evaluation, ideally, we would like
the system to be able to identify the news arti-
cle specifically referred to by the url within each
tweet in the gold standard. However, this is very
difficult given the large number of potential can-
didates, especially those with slight variations.
Therefore, following the Concept Definition Re-
trieval task in (Guo and Diab, 2012b) and (Steck,
2010) we use a metric for evaluating the ranking
of the correct news article to evaluate the systems,
namely, ATOPt, area under the TOPKt(k) recall
curve for a tweet t. Basically, it is the normal-
ized ranking ? [0, 1] of the correct news article
among all candidate news articles: ATOPt = 1
means the url-referred news article has the highest
similarity value with the tweet (a correct NARU);
ATOPt = 0.95 means the similarity value with
correct news article is larger than 95% of the can-
didates, i.e. within the top 5% of the candidates.
ATOPt is calculated as follows:
ATOPt =
? 1
0
TOPKt(k)dk (1)
where TOPKt(k) = 1 if the url referred news arti-
cle is in the ?top k? list, otherwise TOPKt(k) = 0.
Here k ? [0, 1] is the relative position (when
k = 1, it means all the candidates).
We also include other metrics to examine if the
system is able to rank the url referred news arti-
cle in the first few returned results: TOP10 recall
hit rate to evaluate whether the correct news is in
the top 10 results, and RR, Reciprocal Rank= 1/r
(i.e., RR= 1/3 when the correct news article is
ranked at the 3rd highest place).
3 Weighted Textual Matrix Factorization
The WTMF model (Guo and Diab, 2012a) has
been successfully applied to the short text simi-
larity task, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised
performance. This can be attributed to the fact that
it models the missing tokens as features, thereby
adding many more features for a short text. The
missing words of a sentence are defined as all the
vocabulary of the training corpus minus the ob-
served words in a sentence. Missing words serve
as negative examples for the semantics of a short
text: the short text should not be related to the
missing words.
As per (Guo and Diab, 2012b), the corpus is
represented in a matrix X , where each cell stores
the TF-IDF values of words. The rows of X are
words and columns are short texts. As in Figure
2, matrix X is approximated by the product of a
K?M matrix P and a K?N matrix Q. Accord-
ingly, each sentence sj is represented by a K di-
mensional latent vector Q?,j . Similarly a word wi
is generalized by P?,i. Therefore, the inner product
of a word vector P?,i and a short text vector Q?,j is
to approximate the cell Xij (shaded part in Figure
2). In this way, the missing words are modeled by
requiring the inner product of a word vector and
short text vector to be close to 0 (the word and the
short text should be irrelevant).
Since 99% cells in X are missing tokens (0
value), the impact of observed words is signifi-
cantly diminished. Therefore a small weight wm
is assigned for each 0 cell (missing tokens) in the
matrix X in order to preserve the influence of ob-
served words. P andQ are optimized by minimize
the objective function:

4 Creating Text-to-text Relations via
Twitter/News Features
WTMF exploits the text-to-word information in a
very nuanced way, while the dependency between
texts is ignored. In this Section, we introduce how
to create text-to-text relations.
4.1 Hashtags and Named Entities
Hashtags highlight the topics in tweets, e.g., The
#flu season has started. We believe two tweets
sharing the same hashtag should be related, hence
we place a link between them to explicitly inform
the model that these two tweets should be similar.
We find only 8,701 tweets out of 34,888 include
hashtags. In fact, we observe many hashtag words
are mentioned in tweets without explicitly being
tagged with #. To overcome the hashtag sparse-
ness issue, one can resort to keywords recommen-
dation algorithms to mine hashtags for the tweets
(Yang et al, 2012). In this paper, we adopt a sim-
ple but effective approach: we collect all the hash-
tags in the dataset, and automatically hashtag any
word in a tweet if that word appears hashtagged in
any other tweets. This process resulted in 33,242
tweets automatically labeled with hashtags. For
each tweet, and for each hashtag it contains, we
extract k tweets that contain this hashtag, assum-
ing they are complementary to the target tweet,
and link the k tweets to the target tweet. If there
are more than k tweets found, we choose the top
k ones that are most chronologically close to the
target tweet. The statistics of links can be found in
table 2.
Named entities are some of the most salient fea-
tures in a news article. Directly applying Named
Entity Recognition (NER) tools on news titles or
tweets results in many errors (Liu et al, 2011) due
to the noise in the data, such as slang and capital-
ization. Accordingly, we first apply the NER tool
on news summaries, then label named entities in
the tweets in the same way as labeling the hash-
tags: if there is a string in the tweet that matches
a named entity from the summaries, then it is la-
beled as a named entity in the tweet. 25,132 tweets
are assigned at least one named entity.2 To create
the similar tweet set, we find k tweets that also
contain the named entity.
4.2 Temporal Relations
Tweets published in the same time interval have
a larger chance of being similar than those are
not chronologically close (Wang and McCallum,
2006). However, we cannot simply assume any
two tweets are similar only based on the times-
tamp. Therefore, for a tweet we link it to the
k most similar tweets whose published time is
within 24 hours of the target tweet?s timestamp.
We use the similarity score returned by WTMF
model to measure the similarity of two tweets.
We experimented with other features such as au-
thorship. We note that it was not a helpful feature.
While authorship information helps in the task of
news/tweets recommendation for a user (Corso et
al., 2005; Yan et al, 2012), the authorship infor-
mation is too general for this task where we target
on ?recommending? a news article for a tweet.
4.3 Creating Relations on News
We extract the 3 subgraphs (based on hash-
tags, named entities and temporal) on news ar-
ticles. However, automatically tagging hashtags
or named entities leads to much worse perfor-
mance (around 93% ATOP values, a 3% decrease
from baseline WTMF). There are several reasons
for this: 1. When a hashtag-matched word ap-
pears in a tweet, it is often related to the central
meaning of the tweet, however news articles are
generally much longer than tweets, resulting in
many more hashtags/named entities matches even
though these named entities may not be closely re-
lated. 2. The noise introduced during automatic
NER accumulates much faster given the large
number of named entities in news data. There-
fore we only extract temporal relations for news
articles.
2Note that there are some false positive named entities
detected such as apple. We plan to address removing noisy
named entities and hashtags in future work
242
5 WTMF on Graphs
We propose a novel model to incorporate the links
generated as described in the previous section.
If two texts are connected by a link, it means
they should be semantically similar. In the WTMF
model, we would like the latent vectors of two
text nodes Q?,j1 , Q?,j2 to be as similar as possible,
namely that their cosine similarity to be close to 1.
To implement this, we add a regularization term in
the objective function of WTMF (equation 2) for
each linked pairs Q?,j1 , Q?,j2 :
? ? ( Q?,j1 ?Q?,j2|Q?,j1 ||Q?,j2 |
? 1)2 (3)
where |Q?,j | denotes the length of vectorQ?,j . The
coefficient ? denotes the importance of the text-to-
text links. A larger ? means we put more weights
on the text-to-text links and less on the text-to-
word links. We refer to this model as WTMF-G
(WTMF on graphs).
5.1 Inference
Alternating Least Square [ALS] is used for in-
ference in weighted matrix factorization (Srebro
and Jaakkola, 2003). However, ALS is no longer
applicable here with the new regularization term
(equation 3) involving the length of text vectors
|Q?,j |, which is not in quadratic form. Therefore
we approximate the objective function by treating
the vector length |Q?,j | as fixed values during the
ALS iterations:
P?,i =
(
QW? (i)Q> + ?I
)?1
QW? (i)X?,i
Q?,j =
(
PW? (j)P> + ?I + ?L2(j)Q?,s(j)diag(L2(s(j)))Q>?,s(j)
)?1
(
PW? (j)X>j,? + ?L(j)Q?,s(j)Ln(j)
)
(4)
We define n(j) as the linked neighbors of short
text j, and Q?,n(j) as the set of latent vectors of
j?s neighbors. The reciprocal of length of these
vectors in the current iteration are stored in Ls(j).
Similarly, the reciprocal of the length of the short
text vector Q?,j is Lj . W? (i) = diag(W?,i) is an
M ?M diagonal matrix containing the ith row of
weight matrixW . Due to limited space, the details
of the optimization are not shown in this paper;
they can be found in (Steck, 2010).
6 Experiments
6.1 Experiment Setting
Corpora: We use the same corpora as in (Guo
and Diab, 2012b): Brown corpus (each sentence is
treated as a document), sense definitions of Wik-
tionary and Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998). The tweets
and news articles are also included in the cor-
pus, generating 441,258 short texts and 5,149,122
words. The data is tokenized, POS-tagged by
Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003),
and lemmatized by WordNet::QueryData.pm. The
value of each word in matrixX is its TF-IDF value
in the short text.
Baselines: We present 4 baselines: 1. Informa-
tion Retrieval model [IR], which simply treats a
tweet as a document, and performs traditional sur-
face word matching. 2. LDA-? with Gibbs Sam-
pling as inference method. We use the inferred
topic distribution ? as a latent vector to represent
the tweet/news. 3. LDA-wvec. The problem with
LDA-? is the inferred topic distribution latent vec-
tor is very sparse with only a few non-zero val-
ues, resulting in many tweet/news pairs receiving
a high similarity value as long as they are in the
same topic domain. Hence following (Guo and
Diab, 2012b), we first compute the latent vector
of a word by P (z|w) (topic distribution per word),
then average the word latent vectors weighted by
TF-IDF values to represent the short text, which
yields much better results. 4. WTMF. In these
baselines, hashtags and named entities are simply
treated as words.
To curtail variation in results due to random-
ness, each reported number is the average of 10
runs. For WTMF and WTMF-G, we assign the
same initial random values and run 20 iterations.
In both systems we fix the missing words weight
as wm = 0.01 and regularization coefficient at
? = 20, which is the best condition of WTMF
found in (Guo and Diab, 2012b; Guo and Diab,
2012c). For LDA-? and LDA-wvec, we run Gibbs
Sampling based LDA for 2000 iterations and aver-
age the model over the last 10 iterations.
Evaluation: The similarity between a tweet and
a news article is measured by cosine similarity. A
news article is represented as the concatenation of
its title and its summary, which yields better per-
formance.3
As in (Guo and Diab, 2012b), for each tweet,
we collect the 1,000 news articles published prior
to the tweet whose dates of publication are clos-
est to that of the tweet. 4 The cosine similarity
3While these are separated, WTMF receive ATOP

for representing news article as summaries

score between the url referred news article and the
tweet is compared against the scores of these 1,000
news articles to calculate the metric scores. 1/10 of
the tweet/news pairs are used as development set,
based on which all the parameters are tuned. The

the performance of systems.
6.2 Results
Table 1 summarizes the performance of the base-
lines and WTMF-G at latent dimension D = 100.
All the parameters are chosen based on the de-
velopment set. For WTMF-G, we try different
values of k (the number of neighbors linked to a
tweet/news for a hashtag/NE/time constraint) and
? (the weight of link information). We choose to
model the links in four subgraphs: (a) hashtags
in tweet; (b) named entities in tweet; (c) time in
tweet; (d) time in news article. For LDA we tune
the hyperparameter ? (Dirichlet prior for topic dis-
tribution of a document) and ? (Dirichlet prior for
word distribution given a topic). It is worth noting
that ATOP measures the overall ranking in 1000
samples while TOP10/RR focus on whether the
aligned news article is in the first few returned re-
sults.
Same as reported in (Guo and Diab, 2012b),
LDA-? has the worst results due to directly using
prior to the tweet, however, that will give a bias to some
tweets, since the latter tweets have a larger candidate set than
the earlier ones
the inferred topic distribution of a text ?. The in-
ferred topic vector has only a few non-zero values,
hence a lot of information is missing. LDA-wvec
preserves more information by creating a dense la-
tent vector from the topic distribution of a word
P (z|w), and thus does much better in ATOP.
It is interesting to see that IR model has a
very low ATOP (90.795%) and an acceptable RR
(46.281%) score, in contrast to LDA-wvec with
a high ATOP (94.148%) and a low RR(27.904%)
score. This is caused by the nature of the two mod-
els. LDA-wvec is able to identify global coarse
grained topic information (such as politics vs. eco-
nomics), hence receiving a high ATOP by exclud-
ing the most irrelevant news articles, however it
does not distinguish fine grained difference such
as Hillary vs. Obama. IR model exerts the oppo-
site influence via word matching. It ranks a cor-
rect news article very high if overlapping words
exist (leading to a high RR), or the news article is
ranked very low if no overlapping words (hence a
low ATOP).
We can conclude WTMF is a very strong base-
line given that it achieves high scores with three
metrics. As a latent variable model, it is able to
capture global topics (+1.89% ATOP over LDA-
wvec); moreover, by explicitly modeling missing
words, the existence of a word is also encoded in
the latent vector (+2.31% TOP10 and ?0.011%
RR over IR model).

Table 2: Contribution of subgraphs when D = 100, k = 4, ? = 3 (gain over baseline WTMF)
With WTMF being a very challenging baseline,
WTMF-G can still significantly improve all 3 met-
rics. In the case k = 4, ? = 3 compared to WTMF,
WTMF-G receives +1.371% TOP10, +2.727%
RR, and +0.518% ATOP value (this is a signifi-
cant improvement of ATOP value considering that
it is averaged on 30,000 data points, at an already
high level of 96% reducing error rate by 13%). All
the improvement of WTMF-G over WTMF is sta-
tistically signicant at the 99% condence level with
a two-tailed paired t-test.
We also present results using different number
of links k in WTMF-G in table 1. We experi-
ment with k = {3, 4, 5}. k = 4 is found to
be the optimal value (although k = 5 has a bet-
ter ATOP). Figure 3 demonstrates the impact of
? = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} on each metric when k = 4.
Note when ? = 0 no link is used, which is the
baseline WTMF. We can see using links is always
helpful. When ? = 4, we receive a higher ATOP
value but lower TOP10 and RR.
Figure 4 illustrates the impact of dimension
D = {50, 75, 100, 125, 150} on WTMF and
WTMF-G (k = 4) on the test set. The trends
hold in different D values with a consistent im-
provement. Generally a larger D leads to a better
performance. In all conditions WTMF-G outper-
forms WTMF.
6.3 Contribution of Subgraphs
We are interested in the contribution of each fea-
ture subgraph. Therefore we list the impact of
individual components in table 2. The impact of
each subgraph is evaluated in two conditions: (a)
the subgraph-only; (b) the full-model-minus the
subgraph. The full model is the combination of the
4 subgraphs (which is also the best model k = 4
in table 1). In the last two rows of table 2 we also
present the results of using authorship only and the
full model plus authorship. The 2nd column lists
the number of links in the subgraph. To highlight
the difference, we report the gain of each model
over the baseline model WTMF.
We have several interesting observations from
table 2. It is clear that the hashtag sub-
graph on tweets is the most useful subgraph:
with hashtag tweet it has the best ATOP and
TOP10 values among subgraph-only condition
(ATOP: +0.379% vs. 2nd best +0.136%, TOP10:
+1.021% vs. 2nd best +0.503%), while in the
full-model-minus condition, minus hashtag has
the lowest ATOP and TOP10. Observing that it
also contains the most links, we believe the cover-
age is another important reason for the great per-
formance.
It seems the named entity subgraph helps the
least. Looking into the extracted named entities
and hashtags, we find many popular named enti-
245
ties are covered by hashtags. That said, adding
named entity subgraph into final model has a pos-
itive contribution.
It is worth noting that the time news subgraph
has the most positive influence on RR. This is be-
cause temporal information is very salient in news
domain: usually there are several reports to de-
scribe an event within a short period, therefore the
news latent vector is strengthened by receiving se-
mantics from its neighbors.
At last, we analyze the influence of author-
ship of tweets. Adding authorship into the full
model greatly hurts the scores of TOP10 and RR,
whereas it is helpful to ATOP. This is understand-
able since by introducing author links between
tweets, to some degree we are averaging the la-
tent vectors of tweets written by the same per-
son. Therefore, for a tweet whose topic is vague
and hard to detect, it will get some prior knowl-
edge of topics through the author links (hence in-
crease ATOP), whereas this prior knowledge be-
comes noise for the tweets that are already handled
very well by the model (hence decrease TOP10
and RR).
6.4 Error Analysis
We look closely into ATOP results to obtain an in-
tuitive feel for what is captured and what is not.
For example, the ATOP score of WTMF for the
tweet-news pair below is 89.9%:
Tweet: ...stoked growing speculation that Pak-
istan?s powerful military was quietly supporting
moves... @declanwalsh
News: Pakistan Supreme Court Orders Arrest of
Prime Minister
By identifying ?Pakistan? and ?Supreme Court?
as hashtags/named entity, WTMF-G is able to
propagate the semantics from the following two
informative tweets to the original tweet, hence
achieving a higher ATOP score of 91.9%.
#Pakistan Supreme Court orders the arrest of the
PM on corruption charges.
A discouraging sign from a tumultuous political
system: Pakistan?s Supreme Court ordered the ar-
rest of PM Ashraf today.
Below is an example that shows the deficiency of
both WTMF and WTMF-G:
Tweet: Another reason to contemplate moving: an
early death
News: America flunks its health exam
In this case WTMF and WTMF-G achieve a
low ATOP of 69.8% and 75.1%, respectively. The
only evidence the latent variable models rely on
is lexical items (WTMF-G extract additional text-
to-text correlation by word matching). To pin-
point the url referred news articles, other advanced
NLP features should be exploited. In this case, we
believe sentiment information could be helpful ?
both tweet and the news article contain a negative
polarity.
7 Related Work
Short Text Semantics: The field of short text se-
mantics has progressed immensely in recent years.
Early work focus on word pair similarity in the
high dimensional space. The word pair similarity
is either knowledge based (Mihalcea et al, 2006;
Tsatsaronis et al, 2010) or corpus based (Li et
al., 2006; Islam and Inkpen, 2008), where co-
occurrence information cannot be efficiently ex-
ploited. Guo and Diab (2012b; 2012a; 2013) show
the superiority of the latent space approach in the
WTMF model achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on two datasets. However, all of them only
reply on text-to-word information. In this paper,
we focus on modeling inter-text relations induced
by Twitter/news features. We extend the WTMF
model and adapt it into tweets modeling, achiev-
ing significantly better results.
Modeling Tweets in a Latent Space: Ramage
et al (2010) also use hashtags to improve the la-
tent representation of tweets in a LDA framework,
Labeled-LDA (Ramage et al, 2009), treating each
hashtag as a label. Similar to the experiments pre-
sented in this paper, the result of using Labeled-
LDA alone is worse than the IR model, due to the
sparseness in the induced LDA latent vector. Jin et
al. (2011) apply an LDA based model on cluster-
ing by incorporating url referred documents. The
semantics of long documents are transferred to the
topic distribution of tweets.
News recommendation: A news recommen-
dation system aims to recommend news articles
to a user based on the features (e.g., key words,
tags, category) in the documents that the user likes
(hence these documents form a training set) (Clay-
pool et al, 1999; Corso et al, 2005; Lee and Park,
2007). Our paper resembles it in searching for a
related news article. However, we target on rec-
ommending news article only based on a tweet,
which is a much smaller context than the set of
favorite documents chosen by a user .
246
Research on Tweets: In (Duan et al, 2010), url
availability is an important feature for tweets rank-
ing. However, the number of tweets with an ex-
plicit url is very limited. Huang et al (2012) pro-
pose a graph-based framework to propagate tweet
ranking scores, where relevant web documents is
found to be helpful to discover informative tweets.
Both work can take advantage of our work to ei-
ther extract potential url features or retrieve topi-
cally similar web documents.
(Sankaranarayanan et al, 2009) aims at captur-
ing tweets that correspond to late breaking news.
However, they cluster tweets and simply choose
a url referred news in those tweets as the related
news for the whole cluster (the urls are visible
to the systems). (Abel et al, 2011) is most re-
lated work to our paper, however their focus is the
user profiling task, therefore they do not provide
a paired tweet/news data set and have to conduct
manual evaluation.
8 Conclusion
We propose a Linking-Tweets-to-News task,
which potentially benefits many NLP applications
where off-the-shelf NLP tools can be applied to
the most relevant news. We also collect a gold
standard dataset by crawling tweets each with a url
referring to a news article. We formalize the link-
ing task as a short text modeling problem, and ex-
tract Twitter/news specific features to extract text-
to-text relations, which are incorporated into a la-
tent variable model. We achieve significant im-
provement over baselines.
