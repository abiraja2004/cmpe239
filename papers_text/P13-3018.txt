Abstract 
In this work we present psycholinguisti-
cally motivated computational models for 
the organization and processing of Ban-
gla morphologically complex words in 
the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify 
whether morphologically complex words 
are stored as a whole or are they orga-
nized along the morphological line. For 
this, we have conducted a series of psy-
cholinguistic experiments to build up hy-
pothesis on the possible organizational 
structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we 
develop computational models based on 
the collected dataset. We observed that 
derivationally suffixed Bangla words are 
in general decomposed during processing 
and compositionality between the stem 
and the suffix plays an important role in 
the decomposition process. We observed 
the same phenomena for Bangla verb se-
quences where experiments showed non-
compositional verb sequences are in gen-
eral stored as a whole in the ML and low 
traces of compositional verbs are found 
in the mental lexicon.  
1 Introduction 
Mental lexicon is the representation of the words 
in the human mind and their associations that 
help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 
1987). Words are known to be associated with 
each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, 
morphology and semantics. However, the precise 
nature of these relations is unknown. 
An important issue that has been a subject of 
study for a long time is to identify the fundamen-
tal units in terms of which the mental lexicon is 
organized. That is, whether lexical representa-
tions in the mental lexicon are word based or are 
they organized along morphological lines. For 
example, whether a word such as ?unimaginable? 
is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word 
or do we break it up ?un-? , ?imagine? and ?-
able?, understand the meaning of each of these 
constituent and then recombine the units to com-
prehend the whole word. 
Such questions are typically answered by de-
signing appropriate priming experiments (Mars-
len-Wilson et al, 1994) or other lexical decision 
tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for re-
cognizing various lexical items under appropriate 
conditions reveals important facts about their 
organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models 
of morphological organization and access and 
related experiments). 
A clear understanding of the structure and the 
processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will 
further our knowledge of how the human brain 
processes language. Further, these linguistically 
important and interesting questions are also high-
ly significant for computational linguistics (CL) 
and natural language processing (NLP) applica-
tions. Their computational significance arises 
from the issue of their storage in lexical re-
sources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and rais-
es the questions like, how to store morphologi-
cally complex words, in a lexical resource like 
WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access 
efficiency. 
There is a rich literature on organization and 
lexical access of morphologically complex words 
where experiments have been conducted mainly 
for derivational suffixed words of English, He-
brew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other lan-
guages (Marslen-Wilson et al, 2008; Frost et al, 
1997; Grainger, et al, 1991; Drews and Zwitser-
lood, 1995). However, we do not know of any 
such investigations for Indian languages, which 
123
are morphologically richer than many of their 
Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian lan-
guages show some distinct phenomena like, 
compound and composite verbs for which no 
such investigations have been conducted yet. On 
the other hand, experiments indicate that mental 
representation and processing of morphologically 
complex words are not quite language indepen-
dent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from 
experiments in one language cannot be genera-
lized to all languages making it important to 
conduct similar experimentations in other lan-
guages.  
This work aims to design cognitively moti-
vated computational models that can explain the 
organization and processing of Bangla morpho-
logically complex words in the mental lexicon. 
Presently we will concentrate on the following 
two aspects: 
? Organization and processing of Bangla Poly-
morphemic words: our objective here is to de-
termine whether the mental lexicon decompos-
es morphologically complex words into its 
constituent morphemes or does it represent the 
unanalyzed surface form of a word. 
? Organization and processing of Bangla com-
pound verbs (CV): compound verbs are the 
subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No 
consensus has been reached yet with respect to 
the issue that whether to consider them as uni-
tary lexical units or are they syntactically as-
sembled combinations of two independent lex-
ical units. As linguistic arguments have so far 
not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive 
experiments to probe the brain signatures of 
verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive 
as well as computational models regarding the 
possible organization and processing of Bangla 
CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). 
With respect to this, we apply the different 
priming and other lexical decision experiments, 
described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al, 
1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically 
for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words 
and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal 
and masked priming experiment on Bangla deri-
vationally suffixed words shows that morpholog-
ical relatedness between lexical items triggers a 
significant priming effect, even when the forms 
are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. 
These observations are similar to those reported 
for English and indicate that derivationally suf-
fixed words in Bangla are in general accessed 
through decomposition of the word into its con-
stituent morphemes. Further, based on the expe-
rimental data we have developed a series of 
computational models that can be used to predict 
the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic 
words. Our evaluation result shows that decom-
position of a polymorphemic word depends on 
several factors like, frequency, productivity of 
the suffix and the compositionality between the 
stem and the suffix.  
The organization of the paper is as follows: 
Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes 
experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents 
the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 con-
cludes the paper by presenting the future direc-
tion of the work. 
2 Related Works 
2.1 Representation of polymorphemic words 
Over the last few decades many studies have at-
tempted to understand the representation and 
processing of morphologically complex words in 
the brain for various languages. Most of the stu-
dies are designed to support one of the two mu-
tually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and 
the morphemic model. The full-listing model 
claims that polymorphic words are represented as 
a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 
1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, 
morphemic model argues that morphologically 
complex words are decomposed and represented 
in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The 
affixes are stripped away from the root form, 
which in turn are used to access the mental lex-
icon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacK-
ay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is 
the partial decomposition model that argues that 
different types of morphological forms are 
processed separately. For instance, the derived 
morphological forms are believed to be 
represented as a whole, whereas the representa-
tion of the inflected forms follows the morphem-
ic model (Caramazza et al, 1988).  
Traditionally, priming experiments have been 
used to study the effects of morphology in lan-
guage processing. Priming is a process that re-
sults in increase in speed or accuracy of response 
to a stimulus, called the target, based on the oc-
currence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, 
called the prime (Tulving et al, 1982). Here, 
subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short 
duration, and are subsequently shown a target 
word. The prime and target words may be mor-
phologically, phonologically or semantically re-
124
lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction 
time of subjects reveals the actual organization 
and representation of the lexicon at the relevant 
level. See Pulverm?ller (2002) for a detailed ac-
count of such phenomena.  
It has been argued that frequency of a word in-
fluences the speed of lexical processing and thus, 
can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the na-
ture and organization of lexical representations.  
(Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English in-
flected words, argued that lexical decision res-
ponses of polymorphemic words depends upon 
the base word frequency. Similar observation for 
surface word frequency was also observed by 
(Bertram et al, 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al, 
1987;Burani et al, 1984;Schreuder et al, 1997; 
Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed 
that words having low surface frequency tends to 
decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the 
dual processing race model that proposes that a 
specific morphologically complex form is ac-
cessed via its parts if the frequency of that word 
is above a certain threshold of frequency, then 
the direct route will win, and the word will be 
accessed as a whole. If it is below that same thre-
shold of frequency, the parsing route will win, 
and the word will be accessed via its parts. 
2.2 Representation of Compound Verbs 
A compound verb (CV) consists of a sequence of 
two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as a single verb 
and expresses a single expression of meaning. 
For example, in the sentence 
 ??????? ? ???  ??? ? (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/) 
?bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp?  
?Eat the breads? 
the verb sequence ????  ??? ? (eat drop)? is an 
example of CV. Compound verbs are a special 
phenomena that are abundantly found in Indo-
European languages like Indian languages.  
A plethora of works has been done to provide 
linguistic explanations on the formation of such 
word, yet none so far has led to any consensus. 
Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an 
aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries. 
Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and 
Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and 
their formation take place at the argument struc-
ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic 
analysis based on ?prepared? and ?unprepared 
mind?. Similar findings have been proposed by 
Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2 
are paired on the basis of their semantic compa-
tibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints. 
Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in 
terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the 
selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the 
semantic level because the two verbs will unify if 
and only if they are semantically compatible. 
Since none of the linguistic formalism could sa-
tisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV 
formation, we here for the first time drew our 
attention towards psycholinguistic and neuro-
linguistic studies to model the processing of 
verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare 
these responses with that of the existing models. 
3 The Proposed Approaches 
3.1 The psycholinguistic experiments 
We apply two different priming experiments 
namely, the cross modal priming and masked 
priming experiment discussed in (Forster and 
Davis, 1984; Rastle et al, 2000;Marslen-Wilson 
et al, 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al, 2008) for 
Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, 
the prime is morphologically derived form of the 
target presented auditorily (for cross modal prim-
ing) or visually (for masked priming). The sub-
jects were asked to make a lexical decision 
whether the given target is a valid word in that 
language. The same target word is again probed 
but with a different audio or visual probe called 
the control word. The control shows no relation-
ship with the target. For example, baYaska 
(aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, 
for which the corresponding control-target pair 
could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age). 
 Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al, 2008) the 
masked priming has been conducted for three 
different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony), 
48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as 
the amount of time between the start the first 
stimulus till the start of the next stimulus. 
Table 1: Dataset for the experiment, + implies 
related, and - implies unrelated. 
There were 500 prime-target and control-
target pairs classified into five classes. Depend-
ing on the class, the prime is related to the target 
Class Example 
M+S+O+ nibAsa(residence)-nibAsi(resident) 
M+S+O- mitra(friend) - maitri (friendship) 
M?+S-O+ Ama(Mango)- AmadAni (import) 
M-S+O- jantu(Animal)- bAgha (Tiger) 
M-S-O+ ghaDi(watch)-ghaDiYAla (croco-
dile) 
125
either in terms of morphology, semantics, ortho-
graphy and/or Phonology (See Table 1).  
The experiments were conducted on 24 highly 
educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of 
them have a graduate degree and five hold a post 
graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies 
between 22 to 35 years. 
Results: The RTs with extreme values and in-
correct decisions were excluded from the data. 
The data has been analyzed using two ways 
ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and 
control), conditions (five classes) and prime du-
rations (three different SOA). We observe strong 
priming effects (p<0.05) when the target word is 
morphologically derived and has a recognizable 
suffix, semantically and orthographically related 
with respect to the prime; no priming effects are 
observed when the prime and target words are 
orthographically related but share no morpholog-
ical or semantic relationship; although not statis-
tically significant (p>0.07), but weak priming is 
observed for prime target pairs that are only se-
mantically related. We see no significant differ-
ence between the prime and control RTs for oth-
er classes.  
We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500 
target words. We observe that maximum priming 
occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some 
priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and 
[M'+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in 
[M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming 
effect was observed. 
3.2 Frequency Distribution Models of Morpho-
logical Processing 
From the above results we saw that not all poly-
morphemic words tend to decompose during 
processing, thus we need to further investigate 
the processing phenomena of Bangla derived 
words. One notable means is to identify whether 
the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the 
processing stage of that word. For this, we apply 
different frequency based models to the Bangla 
polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their 
performance by comparing their predicted results 
with the result obtained through the priming ex-
periment.  
Model-1: Base and Surface word frequency ef-
fect- It states that the probability of decomposi-
tion of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends 
upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the 
stem frequency of a polymorphemic word 
crosses a given threshold value, then the word 
will decomposed into its constituent morpheme. 
Similar claim has been made for surface word 
frequency model where decomposition depends 
upon the frequency of the surface word itself. 
We have evaluated both the models with the 500 
words used in the priming experiments discussed 
above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62% 
and 49% respectively for base and surface word 
frequency models. 
Model-2: Combining the base and surface word 
frequency- In a pursuit towards an extended 
model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We 
took the log frequencies of both the base and the 
derived words and plotted the best-fit regression 
curve over the given dataset. 
The evaluation of this model over the same set 
of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68% 
which is better than the base and surface word 
frequency models. However, the proposed model 
still fails to predict processing of around 32% of 
words. This led us to further enhance the model. 
For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in mor-
phological processing. 
Model-3: Degree of Affixation and Suffix Prod-
uctivity: we examine whether the regression 
analysis between base and derived frequency of 
Bangla words varies between suffixes and how 
these variations affect morphological decomposi-
tion. With respect to this, we try to compute the 
degree of affixation between the suffix and the 
base word. For this, we perform regression anal-
ysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with 
varying degree of type and token frequencies. 
For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived 
words. We observe that those suffixes having 
high value of intercept are forming derived 
words whose base frequencies are substantially 
high as compared to their derived forms. Moreo-
ver we also observe that high intercept value for 
a given suffix indicates higher inclination to-
wards decomposition. 
Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix 
type/token ratio and compare them with the 
base/derived frequency ratio model. This has 
been done by regression analysis between the 
suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface 
frequency ratio.  
We further tried to observe the role of suffix 
productivity in morphological processing. For 
this, we computed the three components of prod-
uctivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and 
Plag, 2004). P is the ?conditioned degree of 
productivity? and is the probability that we are 
encountering a word with an affix and it is 
representing a new type. P* is the ?hapaxed-
conditioned degree of productivity?. It expresses 
the probability that when an entirely new word is 
126
encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the 
?type frequency?. Finally, we computed the 
productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V 
values. We found that decomposition of Bangla 
polymorphemic word is directly proportional to 
the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words 
that are composed of productive suffixes (P val-
ue ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like ?-oYAlA?, 
?-giri?, ?-tba? and ?-panA? are highly decom-
posable than low productive suffixes like ?-Ani?, 
?-lA?, ?-k?, and ?-tama?. The evaluation of the 
proposed model returns an accuracy of 76% 
which comes to be 8% better than the preceding 
models. 
Combining Model-2 and Model-3: One impor-
tant observation that can be made from the above 
results is that, model-3 performs best in deter-
mining the true negative values. It also possesses 
a high recall value of (85%) but having a low 
precision of (50%). In other words, the model 
can predict those words for which decomposition 
will not take place. On the other hand, results of 
Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus, 
we argue that combining the above two models 
can better predict the decomposition of Bangla 
polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the 
two models together and finally achieved an 
overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87% 
and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the perfor-
mance of the other models discussed earlier. 
However, around 22% of the test words were 
wrongly classified which the model fails to justi-
fy. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and 
data analysis are required to predict access me-
chanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words. 
3.3 Stem-Suffix Compositionality 
Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning 
of a complex expression is inferred from the 
meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost 
of retrieving a word from the secondary memory 
is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving 
the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). 
Thus, following the work of (Milin et al, 2009) 
we define the compositionality of a morphologi-
cally complex word (We) as: 
C(We)=?1H(We)+?2H(e)+?3H(W|e)+ ?4H(e|W) 
Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, 
H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the 
stem W and suffix e  and ? is the proportionality 
factor whose value is computed through regres-
sion analysis. 
Next, we tried to compute the compositionali-
ty of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative 
entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual informa-
tion (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure 
of the distance between the probability distribu-
tion of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI 
measures the amount of information that one 
random variable (the stem) contains about the 
other (the suffix).  
We have compared the above three techniques 
with the actual reaction time data collected 
through the priming and lexical decision experi-
ment. We observed that all the three information 
theoretic models perform much better than the 
frequency based models discussed in the earlier 
section, for predicting the decomposability of 
Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we 
think it is still premature to claim anything con-
crete at this stage of our work. We believe much 
more rigorous experiments are needed to be per-
formed in order to validate our proposed models. 
Further, the present paper does not consider fac-
tors related to age of acquisition, and word fami-
liarity effects that plays important role in the 
processing of morphologically complex words. 
Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how 
stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are 
processed by the human brain. 
4 Organization and Processing of Com-
pound Verbs in the Mental Lexicon 
Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special 
type of verb sequences consisting of two or more 
verbs acting as a single verb and express a single 
expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as 
pole and V2 is called as vector. For example, 
???? ???? ? (getting up) is a compound verb 
where individual words do not entirely reflects 
the meaning of the whole expression. However, 
not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For exam-
ple, expressions like, ????? ???? ?(take and then 
go) and ? ???? ?? ??? (return back) are the ex-
amples of verb sequences where meaning of the 
whole expression can be derived from the mean-
ing of the individual component and thus, these 
verb sequences are not considered as CV. The 
key question linguists are trying to identify for a 
long time and debating a lot is whether to con-
sider CVs as a single lexical units or consider 
them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules 
fails to explain the process, we for the first time 
tried to perform cognitive experiments to under-
stand the organization and processing of such 
verb sequences in the human mind. A clear un-
derstanding about these phenomena may help us 
to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb 
127
sequences. In order to do so, presently we have 
applied three different techniques to collect user 
data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 
V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sen-
tences, using a group of three linguists (the ex-
pert subjects). We asked the experts to classify 
the verb sequences into three classes namely, 
CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has 
received 2000 verb pairs along with their respec-
tive example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb 
sequences are unique to each of them and rest 
500 are overlapping. We measure the inter anno-
tator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et 
al., 1981) measure (?) where the agreement lies 
around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb 
sequences that were annotated by all the three 
linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs 
and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. 
We ask each subjects to give a compositionality 
score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point 
scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for 
noncompositional. We found an agreement of 
?=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a 
continuum of compositionality score among the 
verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to 
classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into 
the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, com-
pare the compositionality score with that of the 
expert user?s annotation. We found a significant 
correlation between the expert annotation and the 
compositionality score. We observe verb se-
quences that are annotated as CVs (like, ???? 
???  ,??? ?? ,??? ?? ) have got low compositio-
nality score (average score ranges between 1-4) 
on the other hand high compositional values are 
in general tagged as not a cv (???? ??? (come and 
get), ???? ?? (return back), ???? ?????? (kept), 
????? ??? (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb 
sequences which are not CV shows high degree 
of compositionality. In other words non CV 
verbs can directly interpret from their constituent 
verbs. This leads us to the possibility that com-
positional verb sequences requires individual 
verbs to be recognized separately and thus the 
time to recognize such expressions must be 
greater than the non-compositional verbs which 
maps to a single expression of meaning. In order 
to validate such claim we perform a lexical deci-
sion experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers 
with 92 different verb sequences. We followed 
the same experimental procedure as discussed in 
(Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. 
However, rather than derived words, the subjects 
were shown a verb sequence and asked whether 
they recognize them as a valid combination. The 
reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. 
Our preliminarily observation from the RT anal-
ysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb se-
quences having high compositionality value is 
significantly higher than the RTs for low or non-
compositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis 
that Bangla compound verbs that show less com-
positionality are stored as a hole in the mental 
lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model 
whereas compositional verb phrases are indivi-
dually parsed. However, we do believe that our 
experiment is composed of a very small set of 
data and it is premature to conclude anything 
concrete based only on the current experimental 
results.  
5 Future Directions 
In the next phase of our work we will focus on 
the following aspects of Bangla morphologically 
complex words: 
The Word Familiarity Effect: Here, our aim is to 
study the role of familiarity of a word during its 
processing. We define the familiarity of a word 
in terms of corpus frequency, Age of acquisition, 
the level of language exposure of a person, and 
RT of the word etc. 
Role of suffix types in morphological decompo-
sition: For native Bangla speakers which mor-
phological suffixes are internalized and which 
are just learnt in school, but never internalized. 
We can compare the representation of Native, 
Sanskrit derived and foreign suffixes in Bangla 
words. 
Computational models of organization and 
processing of Bangla compound verbs: presently 
we have performed some small set of experi-
ments to study processing of compound verbs in 
the mental lexicon. In the next phase of our work 
we will extend the existing experiments and also 
apply some more techniques like, crowd sourc-
ing and language games to collect more relevant 
RT and compositionality data. Finally, based on 
the collected data we will develop computational 
models that can explain the possible organiza-
tional structure and processing mechanism of 
morphologically complex Bangla words in the 
mental lexicon.
