Abstract 
We me prototyping a system tor the self-learning of 
Chinese characters, presently on a Macintosh computer. 
The interactive inlormation base provides the learner 
with basic universal properties of the characters 
(morphology, intrinsic meaning), extended wilh a quite 
comprehensive set of language-dependent aspects 
(phonetics, extended semantics, contextual or pragmatic 
attributes). The user is intended to have a professional or 
cultural non-academic motivation. The system allows to 
experiment on Heisig's proposal involving the 
separation of Chinese characters learning (or Japanese 
kanji) from that of the language. A prototype under 
HyperC~rd may be demonstrated on a subset of about 
200 characters. 
Keywords 
Chinese characters, Kanji, interactive information 
base, computer aided learning, personalized autonomous 
acquisition of Chinese characters. 
1. Project motivation 
The aim of the project is twofold: the first part is to 
model an :interactive information base on characteristic 
properties of Chinese characters (or Japanese kanji), 
which would lend itself to personalized self-instruction 
in a tree exploration or encyclopedic mode; and the 
second is to build the base on which we may 
subsequently explore an Intelligent Tutoring System 
architecture, which would take into account the expertise 
already gained by the learner over prior sessions. The 
work presented in the paper concerns the first aim. 
The system is intended to provide a public of 
educated users with an adaptive nvironment for the 
autonomous learning and review of the properties of 
ideogrmns, such as their etymology, structure, graphic 
form, phonetics, semantics, composition (semantic and 
phonetic) within other characters... \[CIYUAN 1984, 
NELSON A.N. 1974\]. 
Our system is not for the study of the Chinese 
language or even of Chinese words (which are usually 
composed of more than one character), but solely for 
that of the characters as basic morphological units, even 
though instantiated with phonetic and semantic values 
in Chinese.We had initially intended to follow Heisig's 
view \[HEISIG 1977\], which separates the acquisition of 
the universal qualities of characters (basically 
morphology and intrinsic meaning), from the learning 
of language-dependent aspects (such as the 
pronunciation, semantics, pragmatics in their use, etc). 
But for developing other applications, it seemed 
advisable to also include in our base a comprehensive 
knowledge of language.-specific attributes, as it is first 
on Chinese language. 
The normal target user is not a scholar. He (or she) 
is an active adult, who is not assumed to have the 
available time nor the tbcusext motivation to undertake 
an intensive academic program (he is a scientist or a 
technical or industrial executive). Rather, he wishes to 
study the characters in a self-paced, extracurricular 
fashion, or to develop a multifaceted view of them 
according to his interests. The user wants to grasp and 
to memorize characters' important properties, to initiate 
his own "learning information base" on them, so, for 
example, not to feel illiterate during working visits in 
China or Japan. Later he might gradually enlarge and 
interrelate his personal knowledge items. 
The learner will be given access, via an encyclopedic 
mode which provides a highly interactive user interface, 
to either basic properties or to extra specific information 
on the characters. He will be able to do so starting 
either from a key property he knows about a character, 
or from a partial (and even partially erroneous) 
description of it. 
He will be also encouraged to record his personal 
discoveries or conclusions as additional materials: his 
personal mnemonics, his own mental images or self- 
built references on semantic links between characters, 
between their graphic form and meaning, etc. It has 
been shown that such an active and creative approach is 
very suitable to Western learners for autonomous 
acquisition and development of cognitive skills during 
file study of Japanese kanji \[HEISIG 1977\]. 
2 .  Overa l l  v iew o f  the  sys tem 
Central objects in the information base of the 
present project are: the current standard information base 
on characters (which merges basic and special material 
on their properties, textual, ideographic, and sound data), 
the learner's current personal information base (with his 
addition~fl notes), and the learner's current profile (data he 
already accessed, drawn from a session journal or a 
global curriculum report). 
1 351  
The main functional handlers in the system are as 
follows: a learner and a developer interface, a query 
analyzer and character selector, a session monitor, a 
session observer, and a session and profile editor. 
The identification and the selection of the working 
character (not a pattern recognition of a character drawn 
by hand) will interpret the learner's query, with respect 
to a subset of classical descriptive properties uch as: 
the meanings, pinyin codes or stroke numbers of the 
character and/or of its semantic or phonetic radical if it 
has one. An expert assistant module will be added to 
enhance the interactive character selection, while 
managing missing or erroneous items in the query. 
3.  The  in fo rmat ion  thesaurus  o f  
Ch inese  characters  
Activities proposed in the system allow the study of 
a comprehensive s t of properties of a character. In the 
information base there are actually two levels of 
accessibility: basic essential information, and additional 
more detailed (or erudite) material \[WIEGER 1972, 
RYJIK 1980\]. They are all listed here, in the context of 
the Chinese language. 
Morphology: 
the etymology of the character, its iconographic 
origin and evolution, 
its generic ategory (among 6 classical ones), 
the calligraphy (the stroke order, the different 
writing styles, their evolution) \[ZHONGGUO 
SHUFA DA ZIDIAN 1983\], 
the structure (synthetic representation f the 
morphological tree of the character, semantic 
and/or phonetic radicals within it), 
the use in derivation or composition within other 
characters. 
Phonetics: 
- the pinyin encoding, the tone, 
- the standard pronunciation (from a digitized sound 
base), 
- ultimately, different provincial or colloquial 
pronunciations. 
Semantics: 
- the usual meaning, 
mnemonics proposed to the learner, 
learner's personal mnemonics~ 
common "false friends" (misleading similarities), 
other characters inhomomorphy, homonymy, 
usually confusing homophones, 
synonyms, antonyms. 
4.  Cur rent  p ro to typ ing  
We first modelled the pertinent material on 
characters, and specified an interaction scheme for the 
user, then the learner interface. 
We refer to an iterative cycle for the software 
development. We have prototyped first a simplified 
version of the system on a very small subset of the 
character base, in order to validate the data structure, the 
design of the main functionals and the user interface. 
We have chosen object-oriented programming tools 
as well-suited to the incremental realization scheme. 
Thus far, this first version is being developed on Apple 
Macintosh under the HyperTalk-HyperCard 
environments, regarded as fair facilities for 
implementing hypertextual and voiced applications. A
second level of prototyping is expected on a Xerox AI 
workstation using LOOPS and Common Lisp. 
5.  Fur ther  deve lopment  
Short-term steps: 
We are currently initiating the first model validation. 
Then are planned both a moderate quantitative, and a 
qualitative, extension of the system. We will first 
enlarge the character set to about 300 units, while 
monitoring both systematic assembly cost, and system 
efficiency measurements. 
Qualitatively, the complementary properties in the 
character base will be completed, and the phonetics will 
be voiced. Next to be worked on, in the prototype, are a 
session journal manager, and the interactive character 
identification and selection function. 
In the future: 
A possible trend leads towards asystem of formative 
use, with a real scale character base and ergonomic 
enrichment. 
On another line for evolution, the system is a basis 
towards exploring knowledge based architectures, which 
then incorporate objects and functional handlers inherited 
from the design of Intelligent Information Retrieval 
Systems \[BRUANDET 1989, CHIARAMELLA 1987\] 
or Intelligent Tutoring Systems \[WINKELS 1988, 
WENGER 1988\].

Conc Ius ion  
The project focuses on characters only, yet a vast 
field of investigation for foreigners (and one of practice 
and review, for native users). Moreover, extending the 
system capability to word formation, then to structural 
or pragmatic views on the language itself, would 
undoubtedly require much dedicated work on the 
language didactics. 
It would be of interest however, in order to confirm 
or to infirm Heisig's hypothesis, to experience different 
practice strategies on an adequate version of tim system, 
and to value whether one better teams characters while 
setmrating their study from that of the language, or 
while merging them. 
A rewarding aspect lies in the scopes of future 
system developments: a realistic and versatile pedagogic 
use on widely accessible micro-stations, as well as a 
contribution to stepwise modelling of built-in 
intelligence, for Computer Based Learnig Systems; and 
last, in the attempt o develop tools for giving larger 
access to Chinese characters - a vehicle for 
communication between over one billion people - in the 
frame of intercultural development.

My deep thanks will go indeed to Frangois Tcheou. 
Without his wide expertise on tim Chinese language, 
and distinguished calligraphy, this work could certainly 
not have been carried out. Many thanks as well to 
Mohan Embar for patient reading of the first draft.
