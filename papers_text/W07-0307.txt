Abstract
The recent advances in speech recognition
technologies, and the experience acquired
in the development of WEB or Interac-
tive Voice Response interfaces, have facil-
itated the integration of speech modules
in robust Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS),
leading to the deployment on a large scale
of speech-enabled services. With these
services it is possible to obtain very large
corpora of human-machine interactions by
collecting system logs. This new kinds of
systems and dialogue corpora offer new
opportunities for academic research while
raising two issues: How can academic re-
search take profit of the system logs of
deployed SDS in order to build the next
generation of SDS, although the dialogues
collected have a dialogue flow constrained
by the previous SDS generation? On the
other side, what immediate benefits can
academic research offer for the improve-
ment of deployed system? This paper ad-
dresses these aspects in the framework of
the deployed France Telecom 3000 Voice
Agency service.

1 Introduction
Since the deployment on a very large scale of the
AT&T How May I Help You? (HMIHY) (Gorin et
al., 1997) service in 2000, Spoken Dialogue Sys-
tems (SDS) handling a very large number of calls are
now developed from an industrial point of view. Al-
though a lot of the remaining problems (robustness,
coverage, etc.) are still spoken language process-
ing research problems, the conception and the de-
ployment of such state-of-the-art systems mainly re-
quires knowledge in user interfaces.
The recent advances in speech recognition tech-
nologies, and the experience acquired in the devel-
opment of WEB or Interactive Voice Response inter-
faces have facilitated the integration of speech mod-
ules in robust SDS.
These new SDS can be deployed on a very large
scale, like the France Telecom 3000 Voice Agency
service considered in this study. With these services
it is possible to obtain very large corpora of human-
machine interactions by collecting system logs. The
main differences between these corpora and those
collected in the framework of evaluation programs
like the DARPA ATIS (Hemphill et al, 1990) or the
French Technolangue MEDIA (Bonneau-Maynard
et al, 2005) programs can be expressed through the
following dimensions:
? Size. There are virtually no limits in the
amount of speakers available or the time
needed for collecting the dialogues as thou-
sands of dialogues are automatically processed
every day and the system logs are stored.
Therefore Dialog processing becomes similar
48
to Broadcast News processing: the limit is not
in the amount of data available, but rather in the
amount of data that can be manually annotated.
? Speakers. Data are from real users. The speak-
ers are not professional ones or have no reward
for calling the system. Therefore their behav-
iors are not biased by the acquisition protocols.
Spontaneous speech and speech affects can be
observed.
? Complexity. The complexity of the services
widely deployed is necessarily limited in order
to guarantee robustness with a high automation
rate. Therefore the dialogues collected are of-
ten short dialogues.
? Semantic model. The semantic model of such
deployed system is task-oriented. The inter-
pretation of an utterance mostly consists in the
detection of application-specific entities. In an
application like the France Telecom 3000 Voice
Agency service this detection is performed by
hand-crafted specific knowledge.
The AT&T HMIHY corpus was the first large dia-
logue corpus, obtained from a deployed system, that
has the above mentioned characteristics. A service
like the France Telecom 3000 Voice Agency service
has been developed by a user interface development
lab. This new kind of systems and dialogue corpora
offer new opportunities for academic research that
can be summarized as follows:
? How can academic research take profit of the
system logs of deployed SDS in order to build
the next generation of SDS, although the di-
alogues collected have a dialogue flow con-
strained by the previous SDS generation?
? On the other side, what immediate benefits can
academic research offer for the improvement
of deployed system, while waiting for the next
SDS generation?
This paper addresses these aspects in the frame-
work of the deployed FT 3000 Voice Agency ser-
vice. Section 3 presents how the ASR process can
be modified in order to detect and reject Out-Of-
Domain utterances, leading to an improvement in
the understanding performance without modifying
the system. Section 4 shows how the FT 3000 cor-
pus can be used in order to build stochastic models
that are the basis of a new Spoken Language Un-
derstanding strategy, even if the current SLU system
used in the FT 3000 service is not stochastic. Sec-
tion 5 presents experimental results obtained on this
corpus justifying the need of a tighter integration be-
tween the ASR and the SLU models.
2 Description of the France Telecom 3000
Voice Agency corpus
The France Telecom 3000 (FT3000) Voice Agency
service, the first deployed vocal service at France
Telecom exploiting natural language technologies,
has been made available to the general public in Oc-
tober 2005. FT3000 service enables customers to
obtain information and purchase almost 30 differ-
ent services and access the management of their ser-
vices. The continuous speech recognition system re-
lies on a bigram language model. The interpretation
is achieved through the Verbateam two-steps seman-
tic analyzer. Verbateam includes a set of rules to
convert the sequence of words hypothesized by the
speech recognition engine into a sequence of con-
cepts and an inference process that outputs an inter-
pretation label from a sequence of concepts.
2.1 Specificities of interactions
Given the main functionalities of the application,
two types of dialogues can be distinguished. Some
users call FT 3000 to activate some services they
have already purchased. For such demands, users
are rerouted toward specific vocal services that are
dedicated to those particular tasks. In that case, the
FT3000 service can be seen as a unique automatic
frontal desk that efficiently redirects users. For such
dialogues the collected corpora only contain the in-
teraction prior to rerouting. It can be observed in that
case that users are rather familiar to the system and
are most of the time regular users. Hence, they are
more likely to use short utterances, sometimes just
keywords and the interaction is fast (between one or
two dialogue turns in order to be redirected to the
demanded specific service).
Such dialogues will be referred as transit dia-
logues and represent 80% of the calls to the FT3000
49
service. As for the 20% other dialogues, referred to
as other, the whole interaction is proceeded within
the FT3000 application. They concern users that are
more generally asking for information about a given
service or users that are willing to purchase a new
service. For these dialogues, the average utterance
length is higher, as well as the average number of
dialogue turns.

OOV rate (%) 3.6 1.9
disfluency rate (%) 2.8 2.1
Table 1: Statistics on the transit and other dialogues
As can be observed in table 1 the fact that users
are less familiar with the application in the other dia-
logues implies higher OOV rate and disfluency rate1.
An important issue when designing ASR and SLU
models for such applications that are dedicated to
the general public is to be able to handle both naive
users and familiar users. Models have to be robust
enough for new users to accept the service and in
the meantime they have to be efficient enough for
familiar users to keep on using it. This is the reason
why experimental results will be detailed on the two
corpora described in this section.
2.2 User behavior and OOD utterances
When dealing with real users corpora, one has to
take into account the occurrence of Out-Of-Domain
(OOD) utterances. Users that are familiar with a ser-
vice are likely to be efficient and to strictly answer
the system?s prompts. New users can have more di-
verse reactions and typically make more comments
about the system. By comments we refer to such
cases when a user can either be surprised what am
I supposed to say now?, irritated I?ve already said
that or even insulting the system. A critical aspect
for other dialogues is the higher rate of comments
uttered by users. For the transit dialogues this phe-
nomenon is much less frequent because users are fa-
1by disfluency we consider here false starts and filled pauses
miliar to the system and they know how to be effi-
cient and how to reach their goal. As shown in ta-
ble 2, 14.3% of the other dialogues contain at least
one OOD comment, representing an overall 10.6%
of utterances in these dialogues.

Table 2: Occurrence of Out-Of-Domain comments
on the transit and other dialogues
Some utterances are just comments and some con-
tain both useful information and comments. In the
next section, we propose to detect these OOD se-
quences and to take this phenomenon into account
in the global SLU strategy.
3 Handling Out-Of-Domain utterances
The general purpose of the proposed strategy is to
detect OOD utterances in a first step, before entering
the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) mod-
ule. Indeed standard Language Models (LMs) ap-
plied to OOD utterances are likely to generate erro-
neous speech recognition outputs and more gener-
ally highly noisy word lattices from which it might
not be relevant and probably harmful to apply SLU
modules.
Furthermore, when designing a general interac-
tion model which aims at predicting dialogue states
as proposed in this paper, OOD utterances are as
harmful for state prediction as can be an out-of-
vocabulary word for the prediction of the next word
with an n-gram LM.
This is why we propose a new composite LM that
integrates two sub-LMs: one LM for transcribing in-
domain phrases, and one LM for detecting and delet-
ing OOD phrases. Finally the different SLU strate-
gies proposed in this paper are applied only to the
portions of signal labeled as in-domain utterances.
50
3.1 Composite Language Model for decoding
spontaneous speech
As a starting point, the comments have been manu-
ally annotated in the training data in order to easily
separate OOD comment segments from in-domain
ones. A specific bigram language model is trained
for these comment segments. The comment LM was
designed from a 765 words lexicon and trained on
1712 comment sequences.
This comment LM, called LMOOD has been in-
tegrated in the general bigram LMG. Comment
sequences have been parsed in the training corpus
and replaced by a OOD tag. This tag is added to
the general LM vocabulary and bigram probabilities
P ( OOD |w) and P (w| OOD ) are trained along
with other bigram probabilities (following the prin-
ciple of a priori word classes). During the decoding
process, the general bigram LM probabilities and the
LMOOD bigram probabilities are combined.
3.2 Decision strategy
Given this composite LM, a decision strategy is ap-
plied to select those utterances for which the word
lattice will be processed by the SLU component.
This decision is made upon the one-best speech
recognition hypotheses and can be described as fol-
lows:
1. If the one-best ASR output is a single OOD
tag, the utterance is simply rejected.
2. Else, if the one-best ASR output contains an
OOD tag along with other words, those words
are processed directly by the SLU component,
following the argument that the word lattice for
this utterance is likely to contain noisy infor-
mation.
3. Else (i.e. no OOD tag in the one-best ASR
output), the word-lattice is transmitted to fur-
ther SLU components.
It will be shown in the experimental section that
this pre-filtering step, in order to decide whether a
word lattice is worth being processed by the higher-
level SLU components, is an efficient way of pre-
venting concepts and interpretation hypothesis to be
decoded from an uninformative utterance.
3.3 Experimental setup and evaluation
The models presented are trained on a corpus col-
lected thanks to the FT3000 service. It contains real
dialogues from the deployed service. The results
presented are obtained on the test corpus described
in section 2.
The results were evaluated according to 3 crite-
ria: the Word Error Rate (WER), the Concept Error
Rate (CER) and the Interpretation Error Rate (IER).
The CER is related to the correct translation of an
utterance into a string of basic concepts. The IER is
related to the global interpretation of an utterance
in the context of the dialogue service considered.
Therefore this last measure is the most significant
one as it is directly linked to the performance of the
dialogue system.

Table 3 presents the IER results obtained with the
strategy strat1 with 2 different LMs for obtaining
W? : LMG which is the general word bigram model;
and LMG + OOD which is the LM with the OOD com-
ment model. As one can see, a very significant im-
provement, 3.7% absolute, is achieved on the other
dialogues, which are the ones containing most of
the comments. For the transit dialogues a small im-
provement (0.2%) is also obtained.
4 Building stochastic SLU strategies
4.1 The FT3000 SLU module
The SLU component of the FT3000 service consid-
ered in this study contains two stages:
1. the first one translates a string of words W =
w1, . . . , wn into a string of elementary con-
cepts C = c1, . . . , cl by means of hand-written
regular grammars;
2. the second stage is made of a set of about 1600
inference rules that take as input a string of con-
cepts C and output a global interpretation ? of
51
a message. These rules are ordered and the
first match obtained by processing the concept
string is kept as the output interpretation.
These message interpretations are expressed by an
attribute/value pair representing a function in the vo-
cal service.
The models used in these two stages are manually
defined by the service designers and are not stochas-
tic. We are going now to present how we can use a
corpus obtained with such models in order to define
an SLU strategy based on stochastic processes.
4.2 Semantic knowledge representation
The actual FT3000 system includes semantic knowl-
edge represented by hand-written rules. These rules
can also be expressed in a logic form. For this rea-
son, some basic concepts are now described with the
purpose of showing how logic knowledge has been
integrated in a first probabilistic model and how it
can be used in a future version in which optimal poli-
cies can be applied.
The semantic knowledge of an application is a
knowledge base (KB) containing a set of logic for-
mulas. Formulas return truth and are constructed
using constants which represent objects and may be
typed, variables, functions which are mappings from
tuples of objects to objects and predicates which
represent relations among objects. An interpretation
specifies which objects, functions and relations in
the domain are represented by which symbol. Basic
inference problem is to determine whether KB |= F
which means that KB entails a formula F .
In SLU, interpretations are carried on by binding
variables and instantiating objects based on ASR re-
sults and inferences performed in the KB. Hypothe-
ses about functions and instantiated objects are writ-
ten into a Short Term Memory (STM).
A user goal is represented by a conjunction of
predicates. As dialogue progresses, some predi-
cates are grounded by the detection of predicate tags,
property tags and values. Such a detection is made
by the interpretation component. Other predicates
are grounded as a result of inference. A user goal G
is asserted when all the atoms of its conjunction are
grounded and asserted true.
Grouping the predicates whose conjunction is the
premise for asserting a goal Gi is a process that goes
through a sequence of states: S1(Gi), S2(Gi), . . .
Let ?ik be the content of the STM used for as-
serting the predicates grounded at the k-th turn of a
dialogue. These predicates are part of the premise
for asserting the i-th goal.
Let Gi be an instance of the i-th goal asserted after
grounding all the predicates in the premise.
?ik can be represented by a composition from a
partial hypothesis ?ik? 1 available at turn k ? 1, the
machine action ak?1 performed at turn k ? 1 and
the semantic interpretation ?ik i.e.:
?ik = ?
(
?ik, ak?1,?ik?1
)
Sk(Gi) is an information state that can lead to a
user?s goal Gi and ?ik is part of the premise for as-
serting Gi at turn k.
State probability can be written as follows:
P (Sk(Gi)|Yk) = P
(
Gi|?ik
)
P
(
?ik|Yk
) (1)
where P
(
Gi|?ik
)
is the probability that Gi is the
type of goal that corresponds to the user interac-
tion given the grounding predicates in ?ik. Yk is the
acoustic features of the user?s utterance at turn k.
Probabilities of states can be used to define a be-
lief of the dialogue system.
A first model allowing multiple dialog state se-
quence hypothesis is proposed in (Damnati et al,
2007). In this model each dialog state correspond
to a system state in the dialog automaton. In order
to deal with flexible dialog strategies and following
previous work (Williams and Young, 2007), a new
model based on a Partially Observable Markov De-
cision Process (POMDP) is currently studied.
If no dialog history is taken into account,
P
(
?ik|Y
)
comes down to P
(
?ik|Y
)
, ?ik being a
semantic attribute/value pair produced by the Ver-
bateam interpretation rules.
The integration of this semantic decoding process
in the ASR process is presented in the next section.
5 Optimizing the ASR and SLU processes
With the stochastic models proposed in section 4,
different strategies can be built and optimized. We
are interested here in the integration of the ASR and
SLU processes. As already shown by previous stud-
ies (Wang et al, 2005), the traditional sequential ap-
proach that first looks for the best sequence of words
52
W? before looking for the best interpretation ?? of an
utterance is sub-optimal. Performing SLU on a word
lattice output by the ASR module is an efficient way
of integrating the search for the best sequence of
words and the best interpretation. However there are
real-time issues in processing word lattices in SDS,
and therefore they are mainly used in research sys-
tems rather than deployed systems.
In section 3 a strategy is proposed for selecting
the utterances for which a word lattice is going to be
produced. We are going now to evaluate the gain in
performance that can be obtained thanks to an inte-
grated approach on these selected utterances.
5.1 Sequential vs. integrated strategies
Two strategies are going to be evaluated. The first
one (strat1) is fully sequential: the best sequence of
word W? is first obtained with
W? = argmax
W
P (W |Y )
Then the best sequence of concepts C? is obtained
with
C? = argmax
C
P (C|W? )
Finally the interpretation rules are applied to C? in
order to obtain the best interpretation ??.
The second strategy (strat2) is fully integrated: ??
is obtained by searching at the same time for W? and
C? and ??. In this case we have:
?? = argmax
W,C,?
P (?|C)P (C|W )P (W |Y )
The stochastic models proposed are implemented
with a Finite State Machine (FSM) paradigm thanks
to the AT&T FSM toolkit (Mohri et al, 2002).
Following the approach described in (Raymond
et al, 2006), the SLU first stage is implemented by
means of a word-to-concept transducer that trans-
lates a word lattice into a concept lattice. This con-
cept lattice is rescored with a Language Model on
the concepts (also encoded as FSMs with the AT&T
GRM toolkit (Allauzen et al, 2003)).
The rule database of the SLU second stage is en-
coded as a transducer that takes as input concepts
and output semantic interpretations ?. By applying
this transducer to an FSM representing a concept lat-
tice, we directly obtain a lattice of interpretations.
The SLU process is therefore made of the com-
position of the ASR word lattice, two transducers
(word-to-concepts and concept-to-interpretations)
and an FSM representing a Language Model on the
concepts. The concept LM is trained on the FT3000
corpus.
This strategy push forward the approach devel-
opped at AT&T in the How May I Help You? (Gorin
et al, 1997) project by using richer semantic mod-
els than call-types and named-entities models. More
precisely, the 1600 Verbateam interpretation rules
used in this study constitute a rich knowledge base.
By integrating them into the search, thanks to the
FSM paradigm, we can jointly optimize the search
for the best sequence of words, basic concepts, and
full semantic interpretations.
For the strategy strat1 only the best path is kept in
the FSM corresponding to the word lattice, simulat-
ing a sequential approach. For strat2 the best inter-
pretation ?? is obtained on the whole concept lattice.
error WER CER IER
strat1 40.1 24.4 15.0
strat2 38.2 22.5 14.5
Table 4: Word Error Rate (WER), Concept Error
Rate (CER) and Interpretation Error Rate (IER) ac-
cording to the SLU strategy
The comparison among the two strategies is given
in table 4. As we can see a small improvement is ob-
tained for the interpretation error rate (IER) with the
integrated strategy (strat2). This gain is small; how-
ever it is interesting to look at the Oracle IER that
can be obtained on an n-best list of interpretations
produced by each strategy (the Oracle IER being the
lowest IER that can be obtained on an n-best list of
hypotheses with a perfect Oracle decision process).
This comparison is given in Figure 1. As one can
see a much lower Oracle IER can be achieved with
strat2. For example, with an n-best list of 5 interpre-
tations, the lowest IER is 7.4 for strat1 and only 4.8
for strat2. This is very interesting for dialogue sys-
tems as the Dialog Manager can use dialogue con-
text information in order to filter such n-best lists.

5.2 Optimizing WER, CER and IER
Table 4 also indicates that the improvements ob-
tained on the WER and CER dimensions don?t al-
ways lead to similar improvements in IER. This is
due to the fact that the improvements in WER and
CER are mostly due to a significant reduction in the
insertion rates of words and concepts. Because the
same weight is usually given to all kinds of errors
(insertions, substitutions and deletions), a decrease
in the overall error rate can be misleading as inter-
pretation strategies can deal more easily with inser-
tions than deletions or substitutions. Therefore the
reduction of the overall WER and CER measures is
not a reliable indicator of an increase of performance
of the whole SLU module.

or more recently (Wang et al, 2003). They are il-
lustrated by Table 5 and Table 6. The figures shown
in these tables were computed on the subset of utter-
ances that were passed to the SLU component. Ut-
terances for which an OOD has been detected are
discarded. In Table 5 are displayed the error rates
obtained on words, concepts and interpretations both
on the 1-best hypothesis and on the Oracle hypothe-
sis (the one with the lowest error rate in the lattice).
These Oracle error rates were obtained by looking
for the best hypothesis in the lattice obtained at the
corresponding level (e.g. looking for the best se-
quence of concepts in the concept lattice). As for Ta-
ble 6, the mentioned IER are the one obtained when
applying SLU to the Oracles hypotheses computed
for each level. As one can see the lowest IER (4.4)
is not obtained on the hypotheses with the lowest
WER (9.8) or CER (7.5).

6 Conclusion
This paper presents a study on the FT3000 corpus
collected from real users on a deployed general pub-
lic application. Two problematics are addressed:
How can such a corpus be helpful to carry on re-
search on advanced SLU methods eventhough it has
been collected from a more simple rule-based dia-
logue system? How can academic research trans-
late into short-term improvements for deployed ser-
vices? This paper proposes a strategy for integrating
advanced SLU components in deployed services.
This strategy consists in selecting the utterances for
which the advanced SLU components are going to
be applied. Section 3 presents such a strategy that
consists in filtering Out-Of-Domain utterances dur-
ing the ASR first pass, leading to significant im-
provement in the understanding performance.
For the SLU process applied to in-domain utter-
ances, an integrated approach is proposed that looks
simultaneously for the best sequence of words, con-
cepts and interpretations from the ASR word lat-
tices. Experiments presented in section 5 on real
data show the advantage of the integrated approach
towards the sequential approach. Finally, section 4
proposes a unified framework that enables to define
a dialogue state prediction model that can be applied
and trained on a corpus collected through an already
deployed service.
