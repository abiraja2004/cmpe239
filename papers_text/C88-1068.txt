In the present  paper  communicat ive  cyc le  
(CC) is cons idered  as a d ia log ar is ing 
between two par tners  dur ing so lv ing a 
problem. Communicat ive  s t ra tegy  (C5) is 
seen as a general  scheme by which a d ia log 
par t i c ipant  is guided in ach iev ing his goal. 
CC is descr ibed in terms of the goals  of the 
par t i c ipants  and CS. 
I, In t roduct ion  
Dia log is a b i la tera l  process  the par ~ 
t i c ipants  of which communicate  each other  
messages  concern ing  the sur round ing  world. 
Each par t i c ipant  in terchang ing ly  under takes  
the ro le  of the author  or the rec ip ient .  
For communicat ion  to be poss ib le  the commu-  
n icants  must unders tand each other, i.e. 
%halt  knowledge  of language and about the 
world must have a shared part. Each par t i c i -  
pant should also know someth ing  about the 
par tner  - his goals, knowledge,  poss ib i l i -  
ties, etc. 
The task of a d ia log model is a formal 
descr ip t ion  of the process  of communicat ion  
or, in a nar rower  sense, descr ip t ion  of the 
communicat ive  s t ruc ture  of the text  (speech)  
generated by the communicants  in this pro-  
cess. Such descr ip t ion  may be represented,  
for example,  in the form of a generat ive  
grammar  or graph /Rob inson  1982, Metz lng 
1981/ and it can be rea l i zed  on a computer.  
One of the aims of work ing out the d ia log 
models  is just to fac i l i ta te  the communica -  
t ion of man with the computer ,  b r ing ing  it 
nearer  to man- to -man communicat ion .  
Next we cons ider  some prob lems ar is ing 
in s imu la t ing  d ia log interact ion.  
2. Communicat ive  cyc le  and communicat ive  
s t ra tegy  
We l imit ourse lves  only  to t reat ing  
such d ia logs  where  the communicants  ( let 
332 
them be A and B) as co -operat ive  par tners  
so lve  some problems.  
The un i t  o f  s imu la t ion  w i l l  be communi -  
ca t ive  cyc le  (CC). We def ine  CC as d ia log 
ar is ing between two par tners  dur ing so lv ing 
a problem. 
CC cons is ts  of the a l te rnate  tu rn - ta -  
k ings of the communicants  though not every 
such sequence  forms a CC. The turns are 
bui l t  up of communicat ive  acts (CA). The 
minimal  combinat ion  in a CC is a coup le  or 
t r ip let  of tu rn - tak ings  Of the par t i c ipants  
(cf. / Lang leben 1984/), for example  A: ques-  
t ion - B: answer, or A: quest ion  - B: answer 
- A: acceptance  of the answer. Any CC starts  
wi th set t ing  up a communicat ive  goal by one 
of the par t i c ipants  (A). Let the goal of A 
be "B does a deed D'?. In natura l  communica -  
t lon ach iev ing  a goal requ i res  more than one 
communicat ive  tu rn - tak ing  f rom both A and B. 
Typical ly ,  A has some obstac les  in ach iev ing 
D: e.g. B does not want to do D; B does not 
rea l i ze  that not doing D involves negat ive  
consequences ;  B th inke  that he is not able 
to do D, etc. For  this reason A must, in 
add i t ion  to f ix ing the goal, a lso determine  
the resources  he has at his d isposal  for 
overcoming  these obstac les ,  and the way of 
us ing these resources  - i t  means that A must 
out l ine  the communicat ive  strategy.  
Having f i xed  the goal G, A tr ies to 
d i rect  the re levant  in te l lectua l  and emot io -  
nal p rocesses  of B (his interests,  assess-  
ments, op in ions)  dur ing the process  of com- 
mun icat ion  in such a way as to eventua l ly  
lead B to a dec is ion  to do D. In doing so 
in f luenc ing the par tner  is ac tua l ly  d i rected  
at cer ta in  aspects  of his mind: his  knowled-  
ge, assumpt ions,  assessments ,  wishes. These  
re levant  aspects  of the mind of the  par tner  
may be cal led his psych ic  parametrss ,  in 
short  P -paramstres .  The dec is ion  of B to 
per fo rm D depends upon the concrete  conf i -  
gurat ion  of the va lues  of his P -parametreso  
The unfavourab ls  va lues  are %he obstac les  
ment ioned  above. The essence  of app ly ing a 
~t~ategy lies in the fac t  that A organizes 
his t~iPn-takings to B in such a way that 
their  r~)sult6 will be a change in the values 
of fi~)d P-parametres i n  a required direc- 
tion: increasing h is  knowledge, changing h is  
assessm~3nts, increasing his conviction, Pe- 
ducing or increasing his wishes, and so on. 
Within ;1 fixed strategy certain P-parametres 
are  chosen which can be influenced, the 
di?ect lon and ways of inf luence (e.go stra- 
tegies of threa%enlng, scaring, tempting, 
convinc:Lng~ etc)~ With respect to  the prima- 
ry comlaunicatlve goal the changing of the 
values of P-parametres may be called "in- 
strumental goal". 
The development of the theory of com- 
municat~ive strategies thus presupposes the 
developr~ont of a theory of  the P-parametres. 
I% woui~d be part of a certain qual i tat ive 
theory of decls lon-making and should, in 
addit ion ?o expl icat ing the system of P- 
parametres, explain also the inf luence of P- 
paramet%'es upon the decisions made by a 
person. The factors that must be taken Into 
accoun? in shaping a decis ion ape numerous. 
But it turns out  that thls diversity can be 
reduced to a limited number of p~imary paPa- 
metres. We can bring forth the fol lowing 
types of P-parametres: assessments (rational 
evaluat ions and those of pleasantness);  
knowled~e (also skills, experience); into- 
rests; requirements (wishes, needs, among 
them a need fop communication).  
Th~ expl icat ion of all possible P- 
parametl'es requires additional inestlgations 
(first of all psychological) .  In a model of 
dialog the P-parametres of a communicat ive 
partner mare up one part of the model of 
partner, During communicat ion some of these 
values ~tay undergo changes .  
3.  Simulat ing the communicat ive cycle 
First of all let us descr ibe the pro- 
cess of formaliz ing the not ion of communica- 
%ire  s t t ,a tegy  (CS) .  
CS may be defined as a procedure which 
deformities the  cho ice  o f  an author's com~ 
municat Jve acts. Th is  choice need not be 
un ique.  I n  this respect CS differs from 
strategy in the game theory Or from a plan 
of communication. 
The author A has f i xed  his communlca= 
t ive str.ategy i f  he 
i )  \]=as es tab l i shed  the  set  o f  P -parametres  
o f  the  par tner  B re levant  'to h i s  communi-  
ca t ive  goa l  G 
it) knows in case of every relevant P-para- 
metre whether in order to achieve the 
goal G it is necessary to increase or lower 
the required value 
i i i )  has determined among the relevant P- 
parametres one parametre, changing the 
value of which is the Immedla%e goal G 
of implementing the  strategy 
iv) knows in case of every relevant P--para- 
metre how to change its values either 
directly with the help of certain CAs, or 
indirectly, by changing the values of other 
P-parameires. 
Let us consider one example of CS. Let 
the goal of %he au?hor A of the strategy be 
G z "B performs a deed D". 
(I) The relevant P-parame%res of B: 
a wish to do D 
assessment of posit ive consequences of D 
assessment of negative consequences of D 
knowledge of the fulf i l lment of the 
precondit ions of D, 
etc .  
(2) Let A know that B's wish %o de D is 
lower than required for doing it. 
(3 )  Let the P-parametme A wan?s to change be 
B's wlsh to do D (which needs increasing). 
This is the immediate goal G i of the stra- 
tegy. 
(4) P-parametres "assossmen?" and "knowled- 
ge" can be influenced d~rectly by such com- 
munlcat ive acts as "giving information", 
"explanation", "substantiation". 
The P-papametre "wish to do D" can be 
influenced only indirectly, through some 
other P-parametres, e.g. bF increasing B's 
assessment of posit ive consequences of D, by 
lowering B's assessment of negative conse- 
quences of D, by increasing B's knowledge 
about the fulf i l lment of precondit ions of D. 
The goal G 1 of applying this strategy 
is to increase B's wish to do D. This may 
proceed in di f ferent ways (by  setting up 
some subgoals and applying corresponding 
suBstrategles):  
A may increase B's assessment of the posi- 
t ive consequence of D (by giving information 
of them, substant iat ing and explaining), 
i.e. to allure, cajole; 
A can lower B's assessment of negative con~ 
sequences of D (by giving information, 
555 
substant ia t ing  and exp la in ing  the i r  bad-  
heSS), i.e. to warn, threaten,  scare: 
A can increase B's ~nowledge  about the 
fu l f i l lment  of the precond i t ions  of D (e.g. 
by informing B about the ava i lab i l i t F  of 
resources  requ i red  for doing D, exp la in ing  
it), i.e. tO convince.  
The communicat ive  s t ra tegy  does not 
de?ermine  un ique ly  the way of ach iev ing  a 
goa l  (the sequence  of communicat ive  acts of 
the par tners )  but leaves the f reedom of 
choice. Const ruct ing  the next turn depends 
among o iheP th ings upon the changes  which 
have been brought  about in the par tne~?s  
model by the in format ion  rece ived  dur ing 
in terpret ing  the prev ious  tu rn - tak ings  of 
the par tner  ( for eMample,  it may happen %hat 
some assumpt ions  of the author  about the 
par tner  do not hold). 
The communicat ive  cyc le  proceeds  as 
fo l lows (par t i c ipants  A and B, A is the 
in i t ia tor  of communicat ion ,  G is the com~ 
municat ive  goal of A). 
In accordance  with specia l  ru les of 
interest  /Saluveer,  e lm 1986/ A f inds the P- 
parametres  of B re levant  to the goal G. On 
the basis  of the par tner  model A determines  
the necessary  changes  in the values of these 
parametres .  Next, A chooses  a re levant  P.- 
parametre  which va lue needs changing.  In 
?his way he chooses  his communicat ive  s?ra-  
tegy the goal G i of which i s  chang ing  the 
va lue  of the chosen  P -parametr~ (in such a 
~ay as is ~equ i red  for ach iev ing the goal 
G). In case of every  F -pa~ametre  A knows 
e i ther  the  l ist of CAs or the list of o ther  
P -parame%res  through which i% is poss ib le  to 
increase or lower %he va lue of the chosen P~ 
parametre .  
In order  to ach ieve  the goal G 1 A has 
there fore  e i ther  to choose a CA f rom a given ~ 
list or determlne  a new P -parametre  (which, 
in its turn, determined  a new communicat ive  
s t ra?egy  which is par% of 'the init ial  CS) 
and mare up the next turn-ta~ing. 
Par tner  B whose goal does not need 
co ins ide  with the goal G determines ,  accor-  
ding to %he ru les  of interest,  th~ P -pare -  
metres  of par tne~ A which are re levant  to 
his goal. On the bas is  of the model of A 
(i.e. his par tner  model )  B determines  %he 
necessary  changes  in these pa~ametres .  B
