SOME COMPONENTS OF A PROGRAM FOR DYNg.MIC MODELLING 
OF HISTORICAL CHANGE IN LANGUAGE 
Sheldon Klein 
ABSTRACT 
A system that is to serve as a vehicle for testing models 
of language change is being programmed in jOVIAL. Inherent in 
the design of the system is the requirement that each member of 
a speech community be represented by a generation grammar and a 
recognition grammar. The units of interaction in a simulation 
are conversations. Grammar rules may be borrowed or lost by 
individuals during the course of a simulation. The rules them- 
selves need not be limited to those suggested by a particular 
theory of lanquaqe; also, they may refer to any or all levels 
of linguistic phenomena. Extralinquistic factors pertinent 
to language change may be incorporated in simulations. 
Klein I. 
1.0 The Simulation System 
A general simulation system which is to serve as a device for 
testing of hypotheses about language change through time is being 
program~ned in JOVIAL, an ALGOL language, and is partially operation- 
1 a! on the Philco computer (4). The basic assumptions about the 
nature of language change inherent in the design of the Program 
include the notion of generation grammar, Bloomfield's concept of 
speech community (i), and Sapir's concept of genetic drift (5). 
Aside from these built in concepts, the program is designed as a 
vehicle for testing models of language change as a function of 
variables selected at the discretion of an experimenter. It is 
intended that the simulation system be sufficiently flexible to work 
with either transformational or stratificational models of language; 
to simulate the interaction of members of a speech community among 
themselves and with members of other communities; to model special 
relations among particular members, e.g. family groups and social 
classes; to simulate multilanguage acquisition; and to model the 
transmission of language from generation to generation. 
A basic assumption of the simulation system is that the 
interaction among members of a speech community is the prime

focal point of language change. Each member of a speech community 
or sample from a speech community is represented by boZh a generation 
grammar and a recognition grammar. Members  of a community who are 
familiar with more than one language may be represented by additional 
gray,mars. The contents of the grammars may vary among individuals. 
Grammars of newborn children would be empty. An adult entering 
a new community as a speaker of an alien language might acquire an 
empty recognition and generation grammar to supplement the nonempty 
ones representing the languages he knows. 
The basic units of interaction are speech forms produced in 
response to other speech forms. ~ primary function of the system 
is to simulate conversations among members of a speech community. 
During the course of a conversation, one individual will generate 
a form and another will attempt to parse it. Should the parser's 
rules be inadequate for the task, he maybor row the necessary rules 
from the generation grammar of the speaker, and perhaps use it when 
it is his turn to speak. Note that a bilingual speaker might 
attempt parsings with rules from all of his grammars. 
Many decisions within the simulation system are made with 
the use of random numbers and functions governing the transition 
from one state of events to another. Monte Carlo techniques will 
be used in conducting simulations. Basically, the term refers to 
the use of random elements to solve essentially deterministic 
problems which may be too complicated to solve by deterministic 
methods. Accordingly, to evaluate the predictions of such a system, 
it is essential to determine the effects of different choices of 
Klein 3. 
random numbers numbers upon the results, if the model is deter- 
ministic, the results of repeated trials relying on different 
inputs of random numbers should be similar. 
2.0 Components 
The basic components of the the simulation system consist of 
a table containing the grammar rules and parameters associated with 
each individual in the simulation; a generation and parsing device 
that makes use of the grammars of interacting individuals; a table 
of functional relationships containing the rules of interaction 
pertinent to a particular simulation model; and, finally, a monitor 
program thai determines the flow of the simulation and the passage 
of time, and that periodically takes a census to inform the experiment- 
er of the changes occuring at various stages of the simulation. 
The first version of the simulation system is being constructed 
around the author's automatic essay paraphrasing system (2) which 
produces essaylike paraphrases of an input consisting of a restricted 
English text and an outline of the desired output essay. The 
syntactic style of the output is controlled by manipulation of 
parameters pertaininq to the frequency of usage of specific generation 
grammar rules (3). 
The table of functional relationships thai contains the definition 
of a particular model of language change might include rules express- 
ing such features as: 
i. Members of the same social group are more l ikely to speak 
to each other than.to members of other groups. 
2. Each time an individual interacts with a particular member 
of the community the probability of future interactions with thai 
Klein 4. 
member increases. 
More complex functions pertaining to particular socio-cultural 
conditions might also be used. 
Other functions might control the deletion of infrequently 
used grammar rules, or the shift of a grammar rule from a recognition 
qrammar to a qeneration qrammar. 
The monitoring system is designed to work with a mixed assort- 
ment of functional relationships pertaining to very different 
phenomena. At a given decision point the monitor scans the 
table of functions sequentially until it finds an applicable item. 
3.0 A Hand Simulation 
The nature and function of the basic components can be illustrated 
by a hand simulation of the flow of an extremely simple language 
model. 
Let the population contain six members: JOHN, ~4ARY, HELEN, 
PETER, HE~.~N and BABY. Let each have a separate generation and 
recognition grammar. Let each be assigned a status in the range 
of .Ol to .99, and let the letters A,B,C,D,E,F represent the grammar 
rules existinq in the community. (See table i.) The content of 
the rules is deliberately left unspecified. The rules may refer to 
semantics, syntax, morphology and/or phonology. Each rule is 
associated with a weighted frequency. A rule with a frequency weight 
less than a specified threshold value (.i in this simulation) can 
exist only in a recognition grammar. A rule with a frequency weight 
greater than or equal to the threshold must exist both in an individual's 
generation and recognition grammars. A rule existing in both grammars 
has the same frequency weight in each. A rule whose weight drops

Table 1 contains a record of the various states of the speech 
community at time Ti,j, where i refers to a major cycle--a single 
individual's interaction with a variety of speakers, and where j 
refers to a minor cycle--the interval of an interaction with a single 
speaker. At each increment in the value i, the monitor randomly 
selects a member as speaker for a major cycle." The monitor then 
scans the population Sequentially to determine which members are 
to be auditors of the speaker. The determination follows the 
appropriate function contained in table 2. Each time an auditor 
is selected, the minor cycle time j is incremented by i. When 
the monitor has scanned the entire community, the speaker's turn 
is over and a new one is selected to ~ o~ the next major Cycle. 
At the beginning of each major cycle the j or minor cycle value 
is set to zero. The data in column T0, 0 of table 1 are startlng 
data supplied by the author. The  data existing at Ti, j is used 
in comDutinq the state of events during Ti,j~ 1 . Blank entries 
in table 1 indicate that the state of events is unchanged from 
the previous interval. 
Table 2 contains the list of active rules refered to by the 
monitor during the course of the simulation. All computed values 
qreater than or equal to 1 are rounded to .99; values computed at 
less than or equal to 0 are rounded to .01~ in all cases, computed 
values are rounded to the second decimal place.

4.0 Discussion 
The preceding hand S'imulation should be sufficient to illustrate 
the operation of the simulation system. Anticipated computer 
simulations will involve 50 to 100 individuals, each associated with 
several<hundred grammar rules, iUnique ~ parsings can be obtained 
by using 6xistinq frequency weights to determine preferential 
applicability of 'rules. The functions contained in table 2 
can be qreatly extended in number and content. One miqht wish 
to add special rules for interaction between :parent ,'and Child, spouses, 
and among members of the same age'group, etc., plus a mechanism 
for determining the birth and death of various members. The status 
factor might be divided into weights refering to social status, aqe, 
geographical proximity and the like. 
The ideal test of the validity of a simulation is prediction. 
Hopefully, one miqht predict an attested state of a language from 
a model of an attested earlier stage. A major problem in such 
testing may be i i~.xlreme sensitivity of a model to the choice of 
parameter values and constants. For example, the constants in 
the functions of table 2 seem to have the effect of making BABY 
learn too quickly. One might use a higher rate of decay for unused 
Klein 15. 
rules to decrease the learning rate. The need for trial and 
error manipulation of values will increase with the complexity 
of a model. Accordingly, one might start with simple models, 
increasing the complexity by stages. 
The author's immediate research goal is to produce a stability 
simulation involving about 50 members,each associated with a 
simple phrase structure gra~nar of ~ nqmish, over a time span of 
3 or 4 qenerations--a simulation in which the language at the start 
of the simulation is reasonably similar to the language existing 
at the conclusion.
