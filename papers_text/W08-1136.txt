1 Task 1: Attribute Selection
This section describes the two systems developed at
DIT for the attribute selection track of the REG 2008
challenge. Both of theses systems use an incremen-
tal greedy search to generate descriptions, similar
to the incremental algorithm described in (Dale and
Reiter, 1995). The output of these incremental algo-
rithms are, to a large extent, determined by the order
in which the algorithm tests the target object?s at-
tributes for inclusion in the description. Indeed, the
major difference between the two systems described
in this section is the mechanism used to order the
attributes for inclusion.
1.1 DIT-FBI System
The DIT-FBI system selects the next attribute to be
tested for inclusion in the description by ordering
each attribute based on its frequency in the subset of
the training corpus that is defined by the test trial?s
domain (i.e., furniture versus people) and condition
(+LOC versus -LOC). Attributes are selected in de-
scending order of frequency (i.e. the attribute that
occurred most frequently in the relevant subset of
the training corpus is selected first). Where two or
more attributes have the same frequency of occur-
rence the first attribute found with that frequency is
selected. The type attribute is always included in the
description. Other attributes are included in the de-
scription if they exclude at least 1 distractor from the
set of distractors that fulfil the description generated
prior to that attribute?s selection.
The mapping from qualitative linguistics descrip-
tions, such as middle or centre, to the TUNA cor-
pus? quantitative location attribute values, i.e, x-
dimension and y-dimension, can result in both the x-
dimension and y-dimension attributes being included
in the target set. These cases, where both the dimen-
sional attributes are required, are difficult to capture
because each of the dimensional attributes would be
sufficiently discriminative to result in a distinguish-
ing description simply by their lone inclusion. As a
result, a rule was put in place whereby if we have
included either of the dimensional attributes we in-
clude the other dimensional attribute if the included
one refers to the center of the display (i.e., x=3,
y=2).
The algorithm terminates when a distinguishing
description has been generated (i.e., all the distrac-
tors have been excluded) or when all of the target?s
attributes have been tested for inclusion in the de-
scription. Table 1 lists the results for the system.

1.2 DIT-TVAS System
In the DIT-TVAS system the selection of the next
target attribute to test for inclusion in the description
is based on the prior probability of a target?s attribute
with a particular value being used to describe the
target, given that the target has a particular attribute
with that particular value. This prior is computed
by counting the number of trials in the training cor-
pus where the target description included a partic-
221
ular attribute-value pair and dividing this count by
the number of trials in the training corpus where the
target?s properties listed a particular attribute-value
pair.
For example, there are 143 trials in the Reg-08-
Challenge training corpus where the target?s type at-
tribute had the value chair, and in 134 of these tri-
als the description of the target included the attribute
value pair type-chair. As a result, the atribute-value
pair type-chair has a prior probability of being used
to describe the target, given that the target properties
contain this attribute-value combination, of 134
143
?
0.937. Table 2 lists the priors for each attribute-
value combination in the furniture corpus and Table
3 lists the priors for each attribute-value combina-
tion in the people corpus (for space reasons these
tables do not include the priors for the x-dimension,
y-dimension and other attributes-value pairs). Given
these tables and a test trial, the next attribute-value
pair to be tested for inclusion in the description of
the test target is the attibute-value with the highest
prior that has not already been tested for inclusion
and that the target object fulfils.
As is evident from Table 2 and Table 3, there is
no significant difference between the priors of some
attribute-value pairs. For example, in the furniture
domain orientation=left and hasShirt=true have pri-
ors of 0.023 and 0.022 respectively. In order to
avoid situations where a non-significant difference
in priors unduly biases the system toward the inclu-
sion of a particular attribute-value pair, each time
an attribute-vaule pair has been selected for testing
the DIT-TVAS system checks whether there are any
other attribute-value pairs that have not been previ-
ously tested for inclusion in the description of the
target and whose prior is within 5% of the prior of
the attribute-value that has been selected for testing.
In cases where this test returns one or more attribute-
value pairs, the system uses the attribute-value pair
whose inclusion would exclude the most amount of
distractors. Finally, if there is a tie between one or
more attribute-value pairs with respect to distractor
exclusion this is resolved by slecting the attribute-
value pair with the highest prior. Table 4 lists the
results for the system.

2 Task 2: Realisation
This section describes the two systems developed at
DIT for the realisation track of the REG 2008 chal-
lenge. The DIT-CBSR system, Section 2.1, uses a
case-based reasoning approach to realization, which
(Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005) have recently
argued is an appropriate machine learning approach
to natural language processing. The DIT-RBR sys-
tem, Section 2.2, uses a set of hand-crafted domain-
specific rules to generate descriptions.
2.1 DIT-CBSR System
Cased-Based Reasoning attempts to use a history
of past problems and their solutions to solve newly
arising problems. The solution to a new problem is
generated by finding the problem in the set of train-
ing problems the system has previously seen (i.e. the
case base) which most closely matches it and adapt-
ing its solution.
The DIT-CBSR system uses a relatively simple
case matching algorithm. When a new trial requires
sentence generation it?s attribute set is matched
against all of the cases in the training set to deter-
mine which cases is matches most closely. This
matching firstly considers only attributes and their
values. There are three kinds of matches that can
arise from this process:
? Perfect match: the attributes used in both the
query case and the case from the case-base
match perfectly as do their values.
? Partial match: the attribute used by both the
query case and the case from the case-base
match perfectly, but the attribute values do not
match.
? No match: no member of the case-base has a
list of attributes used that match those required
by the query case.
Slightly different actions are taken depending on
the type of match achieved. These are as follows.
Perfect Match Perfect matches are the easiest to
deal with as little effort is required in order to pro-
duce a useful sentence. In fact, if only one per-
fect match is found then that trial?s word string is
used, unedited, as the generated sentence. However,
things become a little more interesting if more than
one case in the case-base matches the query case
perfectly (remembering that the match is only based
on the attributes used and their values). In this case,
the list of matches is first trimmed of any cases that
are not based on the same image as the query case,
as long as this does not remove all cases. If this
does remove all cases we revert to the original set of
matching cases. In either instance, the word strings
in the set of remaining matching cases are consid-
ered to determine if there are any duplicates. If there
are, the word string that appears most frequently is
used as the generated sentence. If there are no dupli-
cates, the shortest word string in the set is chosen.
Partial Match Partial matches occur when there
is no example in the case-base for which all of the
attribute values are the same as those of the query
case. However, there are some case whose attributes
match the query, but whose attribute values are dif-
ferent. This set of cases is sub-divided based on the
number of attribute values in each case that match
those in the query case. This results in a set of cases
that share the highest match score. From this set al
of those cases that are not based on the same im-
age as the query case are removed, as long as this
does not completely empty the set. If this trimming
would completely empty the set it is not performed.
The trial with the shortest word string from the set of
remaining candidate matches is selected. The word
string associated with the selected trial needs to be
modified to account for the disparity between its at-
tribute values and those of the query case. This mod-
ification is done by replacing all substrings in the
selected case?s word string that arise from attribute
values not matching those in the query case with the
substring that is most commonly associated in the
training corpus with the query case?s attribute value.
All of these substrings are identified using the anno-
tated word string element present in each trial.
223
No Match When no match is found a simple rule-
based realiser is used to construct a sentence match-
ing the attribute value set of the query case. The
rules used by the realiser are based on the most com-
mon strings found in the corpus for each attribute
value pair.
Table 5 lists the results for the system.

2.2 DIT-RBR System
In Section 2.1 we noted that if no match was found in
the case-base a simple rule-based realiser was used.
This rule-based realiser, the DIT-RBR system, uses a
sequence of IF-THEN rules based on a study of the
frequencies and order of the phrases used to realise
specific attribute-value pairs in the training corpus.
Theses phrase are easily extracted from the anno-
tated word-string xml element. The great advantage
of this algorithm is that it always able to return a
string given an input. However, the rule-set is spe-
cific to the task and would not generalise as well as
the DIT-CBSR system. Due to space restrictions we
do not list the rules used by the system. Table 6 lists
the results for the system.

scribed in this section simply chains together DIT
solutions to task 1 and task 2.
