Abstract
In this paper, we describe how we created two
state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to de-
tect the sentiment of messages such as tweets
and SMS (message-level task) and one to de-
tect the sentiment of a term within a message
(term-level task). Among submissions from
44 teams in a competition, our submissions
stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining
an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task
and 88.93 in the term-level task. We imple-
mented a variety of surface-form, semantic,
and sentiment features. We also generated
two large word?sentiment association lexi-
cons, one from tweets with sentiment-word
hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons.
In the message-level task, the lexicon-based
features provided a gain of 5 F-score points
over all others. Both of our systems can be
replicated using freely available resources.1
1 Introduction
Hundreds of millions of people around the world ac-
tively use microblogging websites such as Twitter.
Thus there is tremendous interest in sentiment anal-
ysis of tweets across a variety of domains such as
commerce (Jansen et al, 2009), health (Chew and
Eysenbach, 2010; Salathe? and Khandelwal, 2011),
and disaster management (Verma et al, 2011; Man-
del et al, 2012).
1The three authors contributed equally to this paper. Svet-
lana Kiritchenko developed the system for the message-level
task, Xiaodan Zhu developed the system for the term-level task,
and Saif Mohammad led the overall effort, co-ordinated both
tasks, and contributed to feature development.
In this paper, we describe how we created two
state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the
sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS
(message-level task) and one to detect the sentiment
of a term within a message (term-level task). The
sentiment can be one out of three possibilities: posi-
tive, negative, or neutral. We developed these classi-
fiers to participate in an international competition or-
ganized by the Conference on Semantic Evaluation
Exercises (SemEval-2013) (Wilson et al, 2013).2
The organizers created and shared sentiment-labeled
tweets for training, development, and testing. The
distributions of the labels in the different datasets is
shown in Table 1. The competition, officially re-
ferred to as Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,
had 44 teams (34 for the message-level task and 23
for the term-level task). Our submissions stood first
in both tasks, obtaining a macro-averaged F-score
of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the
term-level task.
The task organizers also provided a second test
dataset, composed of Short Message Service (SMS)
messages (no training data of SMS messages was
provided). We applied our classifiers on the SMS
test set without any further tuning. Nonetheless, the
classifiers still obtained the first position in identify-
ing sentiment of SMS messages (F-score of 68.46)
and second position in detecting the sentiment of
terms within SMS messages (F-score of 88.00, only
0.39 points behind the first ranked system).
We implemented a number of surface-form, se-
mantic, and sentiment features. We also gener-
ated two large word?sentiment association lexicons,

one from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags, and
one from tweets with emoticons. The automatically
generated lexicons were particularly useful. In the
message-level task for tweets, they alone provided a
gain of more than 5 F-score points over and above
that obtained using all other features. The lexicons
are made freely available.3
2 Sentiment Lexicons
Sentiment lexicons are lists of words with associa-
tions to positive and negative sentiments.
2.1 Existing, Automatically Created Sentiment
Lexicons
The manually created lexicons we used include the
NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney,
2010; Mohammad and Yang, 2011) (about 14,000
words), the MPQA Lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005)
(about 8,000 words), and the Bing Liu Lexicon (Hu
and Liu, 2004) (about 6,800 words).
2.2 New, Tweet-Specific, Automatically
Generated Sentiment Lexicons
2.2.1 NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon
Certain words in tweets are specially marked with
a hashtag (#) to indicate the topic or sentiment. Mo-
3www.purl.com/net/sentimentoftweets
hammad (2012) showed that hashtagged emotion
words such as joy, sadness, angry, and surprised are
good indicators that the tweet as a whole (even with-
out the hashtagged emotion word) is expressing the
same emotion. We adapted that idea to create a large
corpus of positive and negative tweets.
We polled the Twitter API every four hours from
April to December 2012 in search of tweets with ei-
ther a positive word hashtag or a negative word hash-
tag. A collection of 78 seed words closely related
to positive and negative such as #good, #excellent,
#bad, and #terrible were used (32 positive and 36
negative). These terms were chosen from entries for
positive and negative in the Roget?s Thesaurus.
A set of 775,000 tweets were used to generate a
large word?sentiment association lexicon. A tweet
was considered positive if it had one of the 32 pos-
itive hashtagged seed words, and negative if it had
one of the 36 negative hashtagged seed words. The
association score for a term w was calculated from
these pseudo-labeled tweets as shown below:
score(w) = PMI(w, positive)? PMI(w, negative)
(1)
where PMI stands for pointwise mutual informa-
tion. A positive score indicates association with pos-
itive sentiment, whereas a negative score indicates
association with negative sentiment. The magni-
tude is indicative of the degree of association. The
final lexicon, which we will refer to as the NRC
Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon has entries for 54,129
unigrams and 316,531 bigrams. Entries were also
generated for unigram?unigram, unigram?bigram,
and bigram?bigram pairs that were not necessarily
contiguous in the tweets corpus. Pairs with cer-
tain punctuations, ?@? symbols, and some function
words were removed. The lexicon has entries for
308,808 non-contiguous pairs.
2.2.2 Sentiment140 Lexicon
The sentiment140 corpus (Go et al, 2009) is a
collection of 1.6 million tweets that contain pos-
itive and negative emoticons. The tweets are la-
beled positive or negative according to the emoti-
con. We generated a sentiment lexicon from this
corpus in the same manner as described above (Sec-
tion 2.2.1). This lexicon has entries for 62,468
unigrams, 677,698 bigrams, and 480,010 non-
contiguous pairs.

3 Task: Automatically Detecting the
Sentiment of a Message
The objective of this task is to determine whether a
given message is positive, negative, or neutral.
3.1 Classifier and features
We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Fan
et al, 2008) on the training data provided. SVM
is a state-of-the-art learning algorithm proved to be
effective on text categorization tasks and robust on
large feature spaces. The linear kernel and the value
for the parameter C=0.005 were chosen by cross-
validation on the training data.
We normalized all URLs to http://someurl and all
userids to @someuser. We tokenized and part-of-
speech tagged the tweets with the Carnegie Mellon
University (CMU) Twitter NLP tool (Gimpel et al,
2011). Each tweet was represented as a feature vec-
tor made up of the following groups of features:
? word ngrams: presence or absence of contigu-
ous sequences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 tokens; non-
contiguous ngrams (ngrams with one token re-
placed by *);
? character ngrams: presence or absence of con-
tiguous sequences of 3, 4, and 5 characters;
? all-caps: the number of words with all charac-
ters in upper case;
? POS: the number of occurrences of each part-
of-speech tag;
? hashtags: the number of hashtags;
? lexicons: the following sets of features were
generated for each of the three manually con-
structed sentiment lexicons (NRC Emotion
Lexicon, MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon) and for
each of the two automatically constructed lex-
icons (Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and Senti-
ment140 Lexicon). Separate feature sets were
produced for unigrams, bigrams, and non-
contiguous pairs. The lexicon features were
created for all tokens in the tweet, for each part-
of-speech tag, for hashtags, and for all-caps to-
kens. For each token w and emotion or po-
larity p, we used the sentiment/emotion score
score(w, p) to determine:
? total count of tokens in the tweet with
score(w, p) > 0;
? total score =
?
w?tweet score(w, p);
? the maximal score =
maxw?tweetscore(w, p);
? the score of the last token in the tweet with
score(w, p) > 0;
? punctuation:
? the number of contiguous sequences of
exclamation marks, question marks, and
both exclamation and question marks;
? whether the last token contains an excla-
mation or question mark;
? emoticons: The polarity of an emoticon was
determined with a regular expression adopted
from Christopher Potts? tokenizing script:4
? presence or absence of positive and nega-
tive emoticons at any position in the tweet;
? whether the last token is a positive or neg-
ative emoticon;
? elongated words: the number of words with one
character repeated more than two times, for ex-
ample, ?soooo?;
? clusters: The CMU pos-tagging tool provides
the token clusters produced with the Brown
clustering algorithm on 56 million English-
language tweets. These 1,000 clusters serve as
alternative representation of tweet content, re-
ducing the sparcity of the token space.
? the presence or absence of tokens from
each of the 1000 clusters;
? negation: the number of negated contexts. Fol-
lowing (Pang et al, 2002), we defined a negated
context as a segment of a tweet that starts
with a negation word (e.g., no, shouldn?t) and
ends with one of the punctuation marks: ?,?,
?.?, ?:?, ?;?, ?!?, ???. A negated context af-
fects the ngram and lexicon features: we add
? NEG? suffix to each word following the nega-
tion word (?perfect? becomes ?perfect NEG?).
The ? NEG? suffix is also added to polarity and
emotion features (?POLARITY positive? be-
comes ?POLARITY positive NEG?). The list
of negation words was adopted from Christo-
pher Potts? sentiment tutorial.5

3.2 Experiments
We trained the SVM classifier on the set of 9,912
annotated tweets (8,258 in the training set and 1,654
in the development set). We applied the model to the
test set of 3,813 unseen tweets. The same model was
applied unchanged to the other test set of 2,094 SMS
messages as well. The bottom-line score used by the
task organizers was the macro-averaged F-score of
the positive and negative classes. The results ob-
tained by our system on the training set (ten-fold
cross-validation), development set (when trained on
the training set), and test sets (when trained on the
combined set of tweets in the training and devel-
opment sets) are shown in Table 2. The table also
shows baseline results obtained by a majority clas-
sifier that always predicts the most frequent class as
output. Since the bottom-line F-score is based only
on the F-scores of positive and negative classes (and
not on neutral), the majority baseline chose the most
frequent class among positive and negative, which
in this case was the positive class. We also show
baseline results obtained using an SVM and unigram
features alone. Our system (SVM and all features)
obtained a macro-averaged F-score of 69.02 on the
tweet set and 68.46 on the SMS set. In the SemEval-
2013 competition, our submission ranked first on
both datasets. There were 48 submissions from 34
teams for this task.
Table 3 shows the results of the ablation experi-
ments where we repeat the same classification pro-
cess but remove one feature group at a time. The
most influential features for both datasets turned out
to be the sentiment lexicon features: they provided
gains of more than 8.5%. It is interesting to note
that tweets benefited mostly from the automatic sen-
timent lexicons (NRC Hashtag Lexicon and the Sen-
timent140 Lexicon) whereas the SMS set benefited
more from the manual lexicons (MPQA, NRC Emo-
tion Lexicon, Bing Liu Lexicon). Among the au-
tomatic lexicons, both the Hashtag Sentiment Lex-
icon and the Sentiment140 Lexicon contributed to
roughly the same amount of improvement in perfor-
mance on the tweet set.
The second most important feature group for
the message-level task was that of ngrams (word
and character ngrams). Expectedly, the impact of
ngrams on the SMS dataset was less extensive since

scores on different datasets.

the classifier model was trained only on tweets.
Attention to negations improved performance on
both datasets. Removing the sentiment encoding
features like hashtags, emoticons, and elongated
words, had almost no impact on performance, but
this is probably because the discriminating informa-
tion in them was also captured by some other fea-
tures such as character and word ngrams.
4 Task: Automatically Detecting the
Sentiment of a Term in a Message
The objective of this task is to detect whether a term
(a word or phrase) within a message conveys a pos-
itive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Note that the
same term may express different sentiments in dif-
ferent contexts.
324
4.1 Classifier and features
We trained an SVM using the LibSVM package
(Chang and Lin, 2011) and a linear kernel. In ten-
fold cross-validation over the training data, the lin-
ear kernel outperformed other kernels implemented
in LibSVM as well as a maximum-entropy classi-
fier. Our model leverages a variety of features, as
described below:
? word ngrams:
? presence or absence of unigrams, bigrams,
and the full word string of a target term;
? leading and ending unigrams and bigrams;
? character ngrams: presence or absence of two-
and three-character prefixes and suffixes of all
the words in a target term (note that the target
term may be a multi-word sequence);
? elongated words: presence or absence of elon-
gated words (e.g., ?sooo?);
? emoticons: the numbers and categories of
emoticons that a term contains6;
? punctuation: presence or absence of punctua-
tion sequences such as ??!? and ?!!!?;
? upper case:
? whether all the words in the target start
with an upper case letter followed by
lower case letters;
? whether the target words are all in upper-
case (to capture a potential named entity);
? stopwords: whether a term contains only stop-
words. If so, separate features indicate whether
there are 1, 2, 3, or more stop-words;
? lengths:
? the length of a target term (number of
words);
? the average length of words (number of
characters) in a term;
? a binary feature indicating whether a term
contains long words;
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of emoticons
? negation: similar to those described for the
message-level task. Whenever a negation word
was found immediately before the target or
within the target, the polarities of all tokens af-
ter the negation term were flipped;
? position: whether a term is at the beginning,
end, or another position;
? sentiment lexicons: we used automatically cre-
ated lexicons (NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexi-
con, Sentiment140 Lexicon) as well as manu-
ally created lexicons (NRC Emotion Lexicon,
MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon).
? total count of tokens in the target term
with sentiment score greater than 0;
? the sum of the sentiment scores for all to-
kens in the target;
? the maximal sentiment score;
? the non-zero sentiment score of the last to-
ken in the target;
? term splitting: when a term contains a hash-
tag made of multiple words (e.g., #biggest-
daythisyear), we split the hashtag into compo-
nent words;
? others:
? whether a term contains a Twitter user
name;
? whether a term contains a URL.
The above features were extracted from target
terms as well as from the rest of the message (the
context). For unigrams and bigrams, we used four
words on either side of the target as the context. The
window size was chosen through experiments on the
development set.
4.2 Experiments
We trained an SVM classifier on the 8,891 annotated
terms in tweets (7,756 terms in the training set and
1,135 terms in the development set). We applied the
model to 4,435 terms in the tweets test set. The same
model was applied unchanged to the other test set of
2,334 terms in unseen SMS messages as well. The
bottom-line score used by the task organizers was
the macro-averaged F-score of the positive and neg-
ative classes.
325
The results on the training set (ten-fold cross-
validation), the development set (trained on the
training set), and the test sets (trained on the com-
bined set of tweets in the training and development
sets) are shown in Table 4. The table also shows
baseline results obtained by a majority classifier that
always predicts the most frequent class as output,
and an additional baseline result obtained using an
SVM and unigram features alone. Our submission
obtained a macro-averaged F-score of 88.93 on the
tweet set and was ranked first among 29 submissions
from 23 participating teams. Even with no tuning
specific to SMS data, our SMS submission still ob-
tained second rank with an F-score of 88.00. The
score of the first ranking system on the SMS set was
88.39. A post-competition bug-fix in the bigram fea-
tures resulted in a small improvement: F-score of
89.10 on the tweets set and 88.34 on the SMS set.
Note that the performance is significantly higher
in the term-level task than in the message-level task.
This is largely because of the ngram features (see
unigram baselines in Tables 2 and 4). We analyzed
the labeled data provided to determine why ngrams
performed so strongly in this task. We found that the
percentage of test tokens already seen within train-
ing data targets was 85.1%. Further, the average ra-
tio of instances pertaining to the most dominant po-
larity of a target term to the total number of instances
of that target term was 0.808.
Table 5 presents the ablation F-scores. Observe
that the ngram features were the most useful. Note
also that removing just the word ngram features or
just the character ngram features results in only a
small drop in performance. This indicates that the
two feature groups capture similar information.
The sentiment lexicon features are the next most
useful group?removing them leads to a drop in F-
score of 3.95 points for the tweets set and 4.64 for
the SMS set. Modeling negation improves the F-
score by 0.72 points on the tweets set and 1.57 points
on the SMS set.
The last two rows in Table 5 show the results ob-
tained when the features are extracted only from the
target (and not from its context) and when they are
extracted only from the context of the target (and
not from the target itself). Observe that even though
the context may influence the polarity of the tar-
get, using target features alone is substantially more

by roughly 2 to 4 points.
5 Conclusions
We created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one
to detect the sentiment of messages and one to de-
tect the sentiment of a term within a message. Our
submissions on tweet data stood first in both these
subtasks of the SemEval-2013 competition ?Detect-
ing Sentiment in Twitter?. We implemented a variety
of features based on surface form and lexical cate-
gories. The sentiment lexicon features (both manu-
ally created and automatically generated) along with
ngram features (both word and character ngrams)
led to the most gain in performance.
