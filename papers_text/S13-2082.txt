Abstract 
We propose a method for using discourse rela-
tions for polarity detection of tweets. We have 
focused on unstructured and noisy text like 
tweets on which linguistic tools like parsers and 
POS-taggers don?t work properly. We have 
showed how conjunctions, connectives, modals 
and conditionals affect the sentiments in tweets. 
We have also handled the commonly used ab-
breviations, slangs and collocations which are 
usually used in short text messages like tweets. 
This work focuses on a Web based application 
which produces results in real time. This ap-
proach is an extension of the previous work 
(Mukherjee et al 2012). 
1. Introduction 
Discourse relation is an important component of 
natural language processing which connects 
phrases and clauses together to establish a cohe-
rent relation. Linguistic constructs like conjunc-
tions, connectives, modals, conditionals and ne-
gation do alter the sentiments of a sentence. For 
example, the movie had quite a few memorable 
moments but I still did not like it. The overall 
polarity of the sentence is negative even though 
it has one positive and one negative clause. This 
is because of the presence of the conjunction but 
which gives more weightage to the clause fol-
lowing the conjunction.  
Traditional works in discourse analysis use a 
discourse parser (Marcu  et al, 2003; Polanyi et 
al., 2004; Wolf et al, 2005; Welner et al, 2006; 
Narayanan et al, 2009; Prasad et al, 2010). 
Many of these works and some other works in 
discourse (Taboada et al, 2008; Zhou et al, 
2011) build on the Rhetorical Structure Theory 
(RTS) proposed by Mann et al (1988) which 
tries to identify the relations between the nucleus 
 
 
and satellite in the sentence. 
 
Most of the work is based on well-structured text 
and the methods applied on that text is not suita-
ble for the discourse analysis on micro-blogs 
because of the following reasons: 
 
1. Micro-blogs like Twitter restricts a post 
(tweet) to be of only 140 characters. Thus, users 
do not use formal language to discuss their 
views. Thus, there are abundant spelling mis-
takes, abbreviations, slangs, collocations, discon-
tinuities and grammatical errors. 
These differences cause NLP tools like POS-
taggers and parsers to fail frequently, as these 
tools are built for well-structured text. Thus, 
most of the methods described in the previous 
works are not well suited for discourse analysis 
on Micro-blogs like text. 
2. The web-based applications require a 
fast response time. Using a heavy linguistic re-
source like parsing increases the processing time 
and slows down the application. 
  
Most of the previous work on discourse analysis 
does not take into consideration the conjunc-
tions, connectives, modals, conditionals etc and 
are based on bag-of-words model with features 
like part-of-speech information, unigrams, bi-
grams etc. along with other domain-specific fea-
tures like emoticons, hashtags etc. Our work 
harness the importance of discourse connectives 
like conjunctions, connectives, modals, condi-
tionals etc and show that along with bag-of-
words model, it gives better sentiment classifica-
tion accuracy. This work is the extension of 
(Mukherjee et al 2012). 
 
The roadmap for the rest of the paper is as fol-
lows: Section 2 studies the effect of discourse 
relations on sentiment analysis and identifies the  
 
495
critical ones. Section 3 talks about the semantic 
operators which influence the discourse rela-
tions. Section 4 discusses the lexicon based clas-
sification approach. Section 5 describes the fea-
ture engineering of the important features. Sec-
tion 6 gives the list of experiments conducted 
and analysis of the results. Conclusion and Fu-
ture Work is presented in Section 7. 
 
2. Discourse Relations Critical for Sen-
timent Analysis 
(Mukherjee et al 2012) showed that that the fol-
lowing discourse relations are critical for SA as 
all relations are not useful for SA. Table 1 pro-
vides examples of various discourse relations. 
 
Violated Expectations and Contrast: In Exam-
ple 2, a simple bag-of-words feature based clas-
sifier will classify it as positive. However, it ac-
tually represents a negative sentiment. Such cas-
es need to be handled separately. In Example 5, 
?memorable" has (+1) score and ?not like" has (-
1) score and overall polarity is 0 or objective 
whereas it should be negative as the final verdict 
following ?but" is the deciding factor. 
 
These kinds of sentences refute the neighboring 
clause. They can be classified as Conj_Prev in 
which the clause preceding the conjunction is 
preferred and Conj_Fol in which the clause fol-
lowing the conjunction is preferred. 
 
Conclusive or Inferential Conjunctions: These 
are the set of conjunctions, Conj_infer, that tend 
to draw a conclusion or inference. Hence, the 
discourse segment following them (subsequently 
in Example 11) should be given more weight. 
 
Conditionals: In Example 3, ?amazing" 
represent a positive sentiment. But the final po-
larity should be objective as we are talking of a 
hypothetical situation. 
 
Other Discourse Relations: Sentences under 
Cause-Effect, Similarity, Temporal Sequence, 
Attribution, Example, Generalization and Elabo-
ration, provide no contrasting, conflicting or hy-
pothetical information. They can be handled by 
taking a simple bag-of-words model.  
3. Semantic Operators Influencing Dis-
course Relations 
There are connectives or semantic operators 
present in the sentences which influence the dis-
course relation within a sentence. For example, 
in the sentence the cannon camera may bad de-
spite good battery life. The connective despite 
increases the weightage of the previous dis-
course element i.e. bad is weighted up but may 
introduces a certain kind of uncertainty which 
cannot be ignored.  
 
1.  (I did not study anything throughout the seme-
ster), so (I failed in the exams). 
2.  (Sourav failed to deliver in the penultimate test) 
despite (great expectations). 
3. If (I had bought the amazing Nokia phone), I 
would not be crying). 
4. (I love Cannon) and (I also love Sony). 
5. (The movie had quite a few memorable moments) 
but (I still did not like it). 
6. (The theater became interesting) after a while. 
7. According (to the reviews), (the movie must be 
bad). 
8. (Salman is a bad guy), for instance (he is always 
late). 
9. In addition (to the bad battery life), (the camera 
is also very costly). 
10. In general, (cameras from cannon (take great 
pictures). 
11. (They were not in favour of that camera) and 
subsequently (decided not to buy it). 
Table 1:  Examples of Discourse Coherent 
Relations 
Similarity, in the sentence He gave his best in 
the movie, but still it was not good enough to win 
an Oscar. The connective but increases the 
weight of the following discourse i.e. good and 
win are weighted up but presence of negation 
operator also cannot be ignored.

1. Modals: Events that are happening or are 
bound to happen are called realis events. And 
those events that have possibly occurred or have 
some probability to occur in distant future are 
known as irrealis events. And it is important to 
distinguish between the two as it also alters the 
sentiments in a piece of text. Modals depict ir-
realis events and just cannot be handled by sim-
ple majority valence model. 
 
(Mukherjee et al 2012) divided modals into two 
categories: Strong_Mod and Weak_Mod. 
 
Strong_Mod is the set of modals that express a 
higher degree of uncertainty in any situation. 
Weak_Mod is the set of modals that express 
lesser degree of uncertainty and more emphasis 
on certain events or situations.  
 
Like conditionals, sentences with strong modals 
express higher degree of uncertainty, thus dis-
course elements near strong modals are weighted 
down. Thus, in the previous example the cannon 
camera may bad despite good battery life bad is 
toned down.

Table 2: Discourse Relations and Semantic 
Operators Essential for Sentiment Analysis 
 
2. Negation: The negation operator inverts the 
polarity of the sentence following it. Usually, to 
handle negation a window (typically 3-5 words) 
is considered and the polarities of all the words 
are reversed. We have considered the window 
size to be 5 and reverse the polarities of all the 
words within the window, till either a conjunc-
tion comes or window size exceeds. For example 
In the sentence He gave his best in the movie, 
but still it was not good enough to win an Oscar 
polarities of good and win are reversed. 
  
4. Lexicon Based Classification 
We have used Senti-WordNet (Esuli et al 2006), 
Inquirer (Stone et. al 1996) and the Bing Liu 
sentiment lexicon (Hu et al 2004) to find out the 
word polarities. To compensate the bias effects 
introduced by the individual lexicons, we have 
used three different lexicons. The polarities of 
the reviews are given by (Mukherjee et al 2012) 
 
???? (  ??? ? ?????? ? ?(??? ))
??
?=1
?
?=1
 
 
????? ? ???  =  ??? ???   ?? ????? = 0 
                        
                             =  
??? ???  
2
 ?? ????? = 1  
   
Above equation finds the weighted, signed po-
larity of a review. The polarity of each word, 
pol(wij) being +1 or -1, is multiplied with its dis-
course weight fij and all the weighted polarities 
are added. Flipij indicates if the polarity of wij is 
to be negated. 
In case there is any conditional or strong modal 
in the sentence (indicated by ????? = 1 ), then 
the polarity of every word in the sentence is 
toned down, by considering half of its assigned 
polarity (
+1
2
 ,
?1
2
) 
Thus, if good occurs in the user post twice, it 
will contribute a polarity of +1 ? 2 = +2 to the 
overall review polarity, if ????? = 0. In the 
presence of a strong modal or conditional, it will 
contribute a polarity of 
+1
2
? 2 =  +1. 
497
All the stop words, discourse connectives and 
modals are ignored during the classification 
phase, as they have a zero polarity in the lexicon.  
We have handled commonly used slangs, ab-
breviations and collocations by manually tagging 
them as positive, negative or neutral.  
5. Feature Engineering 
The features specific for lexicon based classifi-
cation for the task sentiment Analysis, identified 
in Section 2.4, are handled as follows: 
 
a) The words following the Conj_Fol (Table 2) 
are given more weightage. Hence their frequency 
count is incremented by 1. 
We follow a naive weighting scheme whereby 
we give a (+1) weightage to every word we con-
sider important. In Example 5, ?memorable" gets 
(+1) score, while ?did not like" gets a (-2) score, 
making the overall score (-1) i.e. the example 
suggests a negative sentiment. 
 
b) The weightage of the words occurring before 
the Conj_Prev (Table 2) is increased by 1. In 
Example 2, ?failed" will have polarity (-2) in-
stead of (-1) and ?great expectations" will have 
polarity (+1), making the overall polarity (-1), 
which conforms to the overall sentiment. 
 
c) The weightage of the words in the sentences 
containing conditionals (if) and strong modals 
(might, could, can, would, may) are toned down. 
 
e) The polarity of all words appearing within a 
window of 5 from the occurrence of a negation 
operator (not, neither, nor, no, never) and before 
the occurrence of a violating expectation con-
junction is reversed. 
  
f) Exploiting sentence position information, the 
words appearing in the first k and last k sen-
tences, are given more weightage. The value of k 
is set empirically. 
 
g) The Negation Bias factor is treated as a para-
meter which is learnt from a small set of nega-
tive polarity tagged documents. The frequency 
count of all the negative words (in a rule based 
system) is multiplied with this factor to give 
negative words more weightage than positive 
words. 
6. Experiments and Evaluation 
For the lexicon-based approach, we performed 
two types of experiments- sentiment pertaining 
to a particular instance in a tweet (SemEval-
2013 Task A) and generic sentiment analysis of 
a tweet (SemEval-2013 Task B). We treat both 
the tasks similarly. 
 
6.1 Dataset 
 
We performed experiments on two Datasets: 
 
1) SemEval-2013-task 2 Twitter Dataset A con-
taining 4435 tweets without any external data. 
2) SemEval-2013-task 2 Twitter Dataset B con-
taining 3813 tweets without any external data. 
 
6.2 Results on the Twitter Dataset A and B 
 
The system performs best for the positive class 
tweets as shown in Table 3 and Table 4 and per-
forms badly for the negative class which is due 
to the fact that negative tweets can contain sar-
casm which is a difficult phenomenon to capture. 
Also the results of the neutral category are very 
less which suggests that our system is biased 
towards subjective tweets and we wish to give 
the majority sentiment in the tweets. 
  
Class Precision Recall F-score 
Positive 0.6706 0.5958 0.6310 
Negative 0.4124 0.5328 0.4649 
Neutral 0.0667 0.0063 0.0114

Neutral 0.6071  0.0104 0.0204

6.3 Discussion 
 
The lexicon based classifier suffers from the 
problem of lexeme space where it is not able 
handle all the word senses. Also, short-noisy text 
like tweets often contain various spelling mis-
takes like great can be grt, g8t etc. or tomorrow 
can be tom, tomm, tommrrw etc. which will not 
be detected and handled properly.  
 
We suggest that a supervised approach compris-
ing of the discourse features along with the bag-
of-words model and the sense based features will 
improve the results. 
 
7. Conclusion and Future Work 
We have showed that discourse connectives, 
conjunctions, negations and conditionals do alter 
the sentiments of a piece of text. Most of the 
work on Micro-blogs like twitter is build on bag-
of-words model and does not incorporate dis-
course relations. We discussed an approach 
where we can incorporate discourse relations 
along-with bag-of-words model for a web-
application where parsers and taggers cannot be 
used as the results are required in real time. 
 
We need to take into consideration word senses 
and a supervised approach to use all the features 
collectively. Also, a spell checker would really 
help in the noisy text like in tweets.
