Abstract
We present a corpus study of local dis-
course relations based on the Penn Dis-
course Tree Bank, a large manually anno-
tated corpus of explicitly or implicitly re-
alized relations. We show that while there
is a large degree of ambiguity in temporal
explicit discourse connectives, overall con-
nectives are mostly unambiguous and al-
low high-accuracy prediction of discourse
relation type. We achieve 93.09% accu-
racy in classifying the explicit relations
and 74.74% accuracy overall. In addition,
we show that some pairs of relations oc-
cur together in text more often than ex-
pected by chance. This finding suggests
that global sequence classification of the
relations in text can lead to better results,
especially for implicit relations.
1 Introduction
Discourse relations between textual units are con-
sidered key for the ability to properly interpret
or produce discourse. Various theories of dis-
course have been developed (Moore and Wiemer-
Hastings, 2003) and different relation taxonomies
have been proposed (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown,
1985; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Knott and
Sanders, 1998). Among the most cognitively
salient relations are causal (contingency), contrast
(comparison), and temporal.
Very often, the discourse relations are explicit,
signaled directly by the use of appropriate dis-
course connectives:

(E2) He is not very strong, but he can run amazingly fast.
(E3) We had some tea in the afternoon and later went to a
restaurant for a big dinner.
Discourse relations can also be implicit, inferred
by the context of the utterance and general world
knowledge.
(I1) I took my umbrella this morning. [because] The forecast
was rain in the afternoon.
(I2) She is never late for meetings. [but] He always arrives
10 minutes late.
(I3) She woke up early. [afterward] She had breakfast and
went for a walk in the park.
An additional complication for automatic clas-
sification of discourse relations is that even in the
presence of an explicit discourse connective, the
connective might be ambiguous between several
senses. For example, since can be used to signal
either a temporal or a contingency relation.
They have not spoken to each other since they argued last
fall. (Temporal)
I assumed you were not coming since you never replied to
the invitation. (Causal)
Several questions directly related to efforts in
automatic recognition of discourse relations arise:
In a general text, what is the proportion of ex-
plicit versus implicit relations? Since implicit rela-
tions are presumably harder to recognize automati-
cally, the larger their proportion, the more difficult
the overall prediction of discourse relation will be.
How ambiguous are discourse connectives?
The degree of ambiguity would give an upper
bound on the accuracy with which explicit rela-
tions can be identified. The more ambiguous dis-
course connectives are, the more difficult it would
be to automatically decide which discourse rela-
tion is expressed in a given sentence, even in the
presence of a connective.
87
In a text, are adjacent discourse relations inde-
pendent of each other or are certain sequences of
relations more likely? In the latter case, a ?dis-
course grammar? of text can be used and easy to
identify relations such as unambiguous explicit re-
lations can help determine the class of implicit re-
lations that immediately follow or precede them.
In this study, we address the above questions us-
ing the largest existing corpus manually annotated
with discourse relations?the Penn Discourse Tree
Bank (Prasad et al, 2008).
2 The Penn Discourse Tree Bank
The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a new re-
source (Prasad et al, 2008) of annotated discourse
relations. The annotation covers the same 1 mil-
lion word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus used
for the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994).
he PDTB is the first corpus to systematically
identify and distinguish explicit and implicit dis-
course relations. By definition, an explicit relation
is triggered by the presence of a discourse con-
nective which occurs overtly in the text. The dis-
course connective can essentially be viewed as a
discourse-level predicate which takes two clausal
arguments. For example, sentence E1 above could
be represented as BECAUSE(?He is very tired?,
?he played tennis all morning?). The corpus rec-
ognizes 100 such explicit connectives and contains
annotations for 19,458 explicit relations
1
.
The PDTB also contains provisions for the an-
notation of implicit discourse relations between
adjacent sentences which are inferred by the reader
but are not overtly marked by a discourse connec-
tive. In this case, the annotator was asked to pro-
vide a connective that best captured the inferred
relation. There are a total of 16,584 implicit rela-
tions annotated in the corpus.
2
In addition to discourse relations and their ar-
guments, the PDTB also provides the senses of
each relation(Miltsakaki et al, 2008). The tagset
of senses is organized hierarchically into three lev-
els - class, type, and subtype. The top class level
contains the four major semantic classes: Expan-
sion, Comparison, Contingency and Temporal.
1
The PDTB allows annotators to tag a relation with multi-
ple senses. In this work we count both of the annotated senses.
So even though there are only 18,459 explicit relations, there
are 19,458 explicit senses.
2
Again, because of multiple senses per relation, the 16,584
senses are part of 16,224 relations.
Class Explicit (%) Implicit (%) Total
Comparison 5590 (69.05%) 2505 (30.95%) 8095
Contingency 3741 (46.75%) 4261 (53.25%) 8002
Temporal 3696 (79.55%) 950 (20.45%) 4646
Expansion 6431 (42.04%) 8868 (57.96%) 15299
Table 1: Discourse relation distribution in seman-
tic and explicit/implicit classes in the PDTB
3 Distribution and ambiguity of
connectives
Table 1 shows the distribution of discourse rela-
tions between the four main relation classes and
their type of realization (implicit or explicit). In-
terestingly, temporal and comparison relations are
predominantly explicit. About 80% and 70%, re-
spectively, of their occurrences are marked by a
discourse connective. The contingency relations
are almost evenly distributed between explicit and
implicit. The expansion relations, the overall
largest class of discourse relations, is in most cases
implicit and not marked by a discourse connective.
Given the figures in Table 1, we would expect
that overall temporal and comparison relations will
be more easily identified since they are overtly
marked. Of course this would only be the case if
discourse markers are mostly unambiguous.
Here we show all connectives that appear more
than 50 times in the PDTB, their predominant
sense (comparison, contingency, temporal or ex-
pansion), as well as the percentage of occurrences
of the connective in its predominant sense. For
example the connective but has comparison as its
predominant sense and 97.19% of the 3,308 occur-
rences of this connective were comparisons.
Comparison but (3308; 97.19%), while (781; 66.07%),
however (485; 99.59%), although (328; 99.70%),
though (320; 100.00%), still (190; 98.42%), yet (101;
97.03%)
Expansion and (3000; 96.83%), also (1746; 99.94%), for
example (196; 100.00%), in addition (165; 100.00%),
instead (112; 97.32%), indeed (104; 95.19%), more-
over (101; 100.00%), for instance (98, 100.00%), or
(98; 96.94%), unless (95; 98.95%), in fact (82; 92.68%)
separately (74; 100.00%)
Contingency if (1223; 95.99%), because (858, 100.00%),
so (263; 100.00%), since (184; 52.17%), thus (112;
100.00%), as a result (78; 100.00%)
Temporal when (989; 80.18%), as (743; 70.26%), af-
ter (577; 99.65%), then (340; 93.24%), before (326;
100.00%), meanwhile (193; 48.70%), until (162;
87.04%), later (91; 98.90%), once (84; 95.24%)
The connectives that signal comparison and
contingency are mostly unambiguous. Obvious
exceptions are two of the connectives that are often
used to signal temporal relations: while and since.
88
The predominant senses of these connectives are
comparison (66.07%) and contingency (52.17%)
respectively. Disambiguating these problematic
connectives has already been addressed in previ-
ous work (Miltsakaki et al, 2005), but even the
predominantly temporal connectives are rather am-
biguous. For example less than 95% of the occur-
rances of meanwhile, as, when, until, and then are
temporal relaions.
While some connectives such as ?since? are am-
biguous, most are not. The discourse connec-
tives in the corpus appear in their predominant
sense 93.43% (for comparsion), 94.72% (for con-
tingency), 84.10% (for temporal), and 97.63% (for
expansion) of the time. Temporal connectives are
most ambiguous and connectives signaling expan-
sion are least ambiguous.
4 Automatic classification
The analyses in the previous section show two very
positive trends: many of the discourse relations are
explicitly marked by the use of a discourse connec-
tive, especially comparison and temporal relations,
and discourse connectives are overall mostly un-
ambiguous. These facts would suggest that even
based only on the connective, classification of dis-
course relations could be done well for all data (in-
cluding both implicit and explicit examples) and
particularly well for explicit examples alone. In-
deed, Table 2 shows the performance of a decision
tree classifier for discourse relations, on all data
and on the explicit subset in the second and third
column respectively.
We use the natural distribution of relation
classes found in theWall Street Journal texts, with-
out downsampling to get balanced distribution of
classes. There are four task settings, distinguishing
each type of relation from all others. For example,
comparison relations can be distinguished from all
other relations in the corpus with overall accuracy
of 91.28%, based only on the discourse connective
(first line in Table 2). The recall for recognizing
comparison relations is 0.66, directly reflecting the
fact that 31% of all comparison relations are im-
plicit (Table 1) and the connective feature did not
help at all in those cases. Over explicit data only,
the classification accuracy for comparison relation
versus any other relation is 97.23%, and precision
and recall is 0.95 and above.
As expected, the overall accuracy of identify-
ing contingency and expansion relations is lower,
Task All relations Explicit relations only
Comparison 91.28% (76.54%) 97.23% (69.72%)
Contingency 84.44% (76.81%) 93.99% (79.73%)
Temporal 94.79% (86.54%) 95.4% (79.98%)
Expansion 77.51% (55.67%) 97.61% (65.16%)

84.44% and 77.51% on all data respectively, re-
flecting the fact that these relations are often im-
plicit. But by themselves these accuracy numbers
are actually reasonable, setting a rather high base-
line for any more sophisticated method of classify-
ing discourse relations. On explicit data only, the
two-way classification accuracy for the four main
types of relations is 94% and higher.
In four-way classification, disambiguating be-
tween the four main semantic types of discourse
relations leads to 74.74% classification accuracy.
The accuracy for four-way classification of explicit
relations is 93.09%. The precision and recall for
each class is shown in Table 4. The worst per-
formance on the explicit portion of the data is the
precision for temporal relations and the recall for
contingency relations, both of which are 0.84.
5 N-gram discourse relation models
We have shown above that some relations, such as
comparison, can be easily identified because they
are often explicit and are expressed by an unam-
biguous connective. However, one must build a
more subtle automatic classifier to find the implicit
relations. We now look at the frequencies in which
various relations are adjacent in the PDTB. Results
from previous studies of discourse relations sug-
gest that the context of a relation can be helpful in
disambiguating the relation (Wellner et al, 2006).
Here we identify specific dependencies that exist
between sequences of relations.

results for pairs of relations
pairs of implicit and explicit relations which have
significant associations with each other (pval <
0.05) are shown in Table 4. For example, ex-
plicit comparison and implicit contingency co-
occur much more often than would be expected if
they were independent. As explicit comparisons
are generally fairly easy to identify, knowing that
they tend to co-occur may be helpful when search-
ing for implicit contingency relations in a text.
6 Conclusion
We have tried to summarize the difficulty of find-
ing discourse relations using the Penn Discourse
Treebank. We noted that explicit and implicit rela-
tions are approximately evenly distributed overall,
making the task easier than many researchers have
feared. We have found that some relations, such as
temporal and comparison, are more likely to be ex-
plicit than implicit, making them relatively easier
to find, while contingency and expansion are more
often implicit. Among the discourse connectives,
the majority are not very ambiguous between the
different types of relations, with some notable ex-
ceptions such as since and meanwhile.
We have carried out a novel quantitative study
of the patterns of dependencies between discourse
relations. We found that while there does not ap-
pear to be a clear template for the sequence of
relations, there are individual relation pairs that
tend to co-occur. Specifically, we found that even
though contingency relations are likely to be im-
plicit and thus difficult to find, they are likely to
be found near an explicit comparison. We plan to
exploit these findings in future work, addressing
discourse relation labeling in text as a sequence la-
beling problem and using the explicit cue words
of surrounding relations as features for finding the
?hidden? implicit relations.
