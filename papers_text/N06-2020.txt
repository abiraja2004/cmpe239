Abstract 
The goal of the on-going project de-
scribed in this paper is evaluation of the 
utility of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
for unsupervised word sense discrimina-
tion. The hypothesis is that LSA can be 
used to compute context vectors for am-
biguous words that can be clustered to-
gether ? with each cluster corresponding 
to a different sense of the word. In this 
paper we report first experimental result 
on tightness, separation and purity of 
sense-based clusters as a function of vec-
tor space dimensionality and using differ-
ent distance metrics. 
1 Introduction 
Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a mathematical 
technique used in natural language processing for 
finding complex and hidden relations of meaning 
among words and the various contexts in which 
they are found (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lan-
dauer et al 1998). LSA is based on the idea of as-
sociation of elements (words) with contexts and 
similarity in word meaning is defined by similarity 
in shared contexts. 
The starting point for LSA is the construction of a 
co-occurrence matrix, where the columns represent 
the different contexts in the corpus, and the rows 
the different word tokens.  An entry ij in the matrix 
corresponds to the count of the number of times 
the word token i appeared in context j.  Often the 
co-occurrence matrix is normalized for document 
length and word entropy (Dumais, 1994). 
The critical step of the LSA algorithm is to com-
pute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of 
the normalized co-occurrence matrix. If the matri-
ces comprising the SVD are permuted such that the 
singular values are in decreasing order, they can be 
truncated to a much lower rank. According to Lan-
dauer and Dumais (1997), it is this dimensionality 
reduction step, the combining of surface informa-
tion into a deeper abstraction that captures the mu-
tual implications of words and passages and 
uncovers important structural aspects of a problem 
while filtering out noise. The singular vectors re-
flect principal components, or axes of greatest 
variance in the data, constituting the hidden ab-
stract concepts of the semantic space, and each 
word and each document is represented as a linear 
combination of these concepts.  
Within the LSA framework   discreet entities such 
as words and documents are mapped into the same 
continuous low-dimensional parameter space, re-
vealing the underlying semantic structure of these 
entities and making it especially efficient for vari-
ety of machine-learning algorithms.  Following 
successful application of LSA to information re-
trieval other areas of application of the same meth-
odology have been explored, including language 
modeling, word and document clustering, call rout-
ing and semantic inference for spoken interface 
control (Bellegarda, 2005). 
The ultimate goal of the project described here is 
to explore the use of LSA for unsupervised identi-
fication of word senses and for estimating word 
sense frequencies from application relevant cor-
pora following Sch?tze?s (1998) context-group 
discrimination paradigm. In this paper we describe 
a first set of experiments investigating the tight-
ness, separation and purity properties of sense-
based clusters.

2 Experimental Setup 
The basic idea of the context-group discrimination 
paradigm adopted in this investigation is to induce 
senses of ambiguous word from their contextual 
similarity. The occurrences of an ambiguous word 
represented by their context vectors are grouped 
into clusters, where clusters consist of contextually 
similar occurrences. The context vectors in our 
experiments are LSA-based representation of the 
documents in which the ambiguous word appears.  
Context vectors from the training portion of the 
corpus are grouped into clusters and the centroid of 
the cluster?the sense vector?is computed.  Am-
biguous words from the test portion of the corpus 
are disambiguated by finding the closest sense vec-
tor (cluster centroid) to its context vector represen-
tation. If sense labels are available for the 
ambiguous words in the corpus, sense vectors are 
given a label that corresponds to the majority sense 
in their cluster, and sense discrimination accuracy 
can be evaluated by computing the percentage of 
ambiguous words from the test portion that were 
mapped to the sense vector whose label corre-
sponds to the ambiguous word?s sense label.  
Our goal is to investigate how well the different 
senses of ambiguous words are separated in the 
LSA-based vector space. With an ideal representa-
tion the clusters of context vectors would be tight 
(the vectors in the cluster close to each other and 
close to centroid of the cluster), and far away from 
each other, and each cluster would  be pure, i.e., 
consisting of  vectors corresponding to words with 
the same sense. Since we don?t want the evaluation 
of the LSA-based representation to be influenced 
by the choice of clustering algorithm,  or the algo-
rithm?s initialization and its parameter settings that 
determine the resulting grouping, we took an or-
thogonal approach to the problem: Instead of 
evaluating the purity of the clusters based on geo-
metrical position of vectors, we evaluate how well-
formed the clusters based on sense labels are,  how 
separated from each other  and tight they are. As 
will be discussed below, performance evaluation of 
such sense-based clusters results in an upper bound 
on  the performance that can be obtained by clus-
tering algorithms such as EM or  K-means.  
3 Results 
We used the line-hard-serve-interest cor-
pus(Leacock et al 1993), with 1151 instances for 3 
noun senses of word ?Line?: cord - 373,  division - 
374, and text - 404;  752 instances for 2 adjective 
senses of word ?Hard?: difficult ? 376, not yield-
ing to pressure or easily penetrated ? 376; 1292 
instances for 2 verb senses of word ?Serve?: serv-
ing a purpose, role or function or acting as ? 853,  
and providing service 439; and 2113 instances for 
3 noun senses of word ?Interest?: readiness to give 
attention - 361, a share in a company or business ? 
500, money paid for the use of money -1252.  
For all instances of an ambiguous word in the cor-
pus   we computed the corresponding LSA context 
vectors, and grouped them into clusters according 
to the sense label given in the corpus. To evaluate 
the inter-cluster tightness and intra-cluster separa-
tion for variable-dimensionality LSA representa-
tion we used the following measures:  
1. Sense discrimination accuracy. To compute 
sense discrimination accuracy the centroid of each 
sense cluster was computed using 90% of the data. 
We evaluated the sense discrimination accuracy 
using the remaining 10% of the data reserved for 
testing by computing for each test context vector 
the closest cluster centroid and comparing their 
sense labels.  To increase the robustness of this 
evaluation we repeated this computation 10 times, 
each time using a different 10% chunk for test 
data, round-robin style. The sense discrimination 
accuracy estimated in this way constitutes an upper 
bound on the sense discrimination performance of 
unsupervised clustering such as K-means or EM: 
The sense-based centroids, by definition, are the 
points with minimal average distance to all the 
same-sense points in the training set, while the 
centroids found by unsupervised clustering are 
based on geometric properties of all context vec-
tors, regardless of their sense label.      
2. Average Silhouette Value. The silhouette value 
(Rousseeuw, 1987) for each point is a measure of 
how similar that   point is to points in its own clus-
ter vs. points in other clusters. This measure ranges 
from +1, indicating points that are very distant 
from neighboring clusters, through 0, indicating 
points that are not distinctly in one cluster or 
another, to -1, indicating points that are probably 
assigned to the wrong cluster. To construct the sil-
houette value for each vector i, S(i), the following 
formula is used:  
78
)}(),(max{
))()(()(
ibia
iaibiS ?= , 
where a(i)  is an average distance  of i-object to all 
other objects in the same cluster and b(i) is a 
minimum of average distance of i-object to all ob-
jects in other cluster (in  other words,  it is the av-
erage distance to the points in closest cluster 
among the other clusters). The overall average sil-
houette value is simply the average of the S(i) for 
all points in the whole dataset.  
 
 
Figure 1: Average discrimination accuracy 
 
Figure 1 plots the average discrimination accuracy 
as a function of LSA dimensionality for different 
distance/similarity measures, namely L2, L1 and 
cosine, for the 4 ambiguous words in the corpus. 
Note that the distance measure choice affects not 
only the classification of a point to the cluster, but 
also the computation of cluster centroid. For L2 
and cosine measures the centroid is simply the av-
erage of vectors in the cluster, while for L1 it is the 
median, i.e., the value of i-th dimension of the 
cluster centroid vector is the median of values of 
the i-th dimension of all the vectors in the cluster.  
As can be seen from the sense discrimination re-
sults in Fig. 1, cosine distance, the most frequently 
used distance measure in LSA applications, has the 
best performance in for 3 out of 4 words in the 
corpus. Only for ?Hard? does L1 outperforms co-
sine for low values of LSA dimension. As to the 
influence of dimensionality reduction on sense dis-
crimination accuracy, our results show that (at least 
for the cosine distance) the accuracy does not peak 
at any reduced dimension, rather it increases 
monotonically, first rapidly and then reaching satu-
ration as the dimension is increased from its lowest 
value (50 in our experiments) to the full dimension 
that corresponds to the number of contexts in the 
corpus.  
 These results suggest that the value of dimension-
ality reduction is not in increasing the sense dis-
crimination power of LSA representation, but in 
making the subsequent computations more effi-
cient and perhaps enabling working with much 
larger corpora. For every number of dimensions 
examined, the average sense discrimination accu-
racy is significantly better than the baseline that 
was computed as the relative percentage of the 
most frequent sense of each ambiguous word in the 
corpus.  
Figure 2 shows the average silhouette values for 
the sense-based clusters as a function of the dimen-
sionality of the underlying LSA?based vector rep-
resentation for the 3 different distance metrics and 
for the 4 words in the corpus. The average silhou-
ette value is close to zero, not varying significantly 
for the different number of dimensions and dis-
tance measures. Although the measured silhouette 
values indicate that the sense-based clusters are not 
very tight, the sense-discrimination accuracy re-
sults suggest that    they are sufficiently far from 
each other to guarantee relatively high accuracy.  
4 Summary and Discussion 
In this paper we reported on the first in a series of 
experiments aimed at examining the sense dis-
crimination utility of LSA-based vector representa-
tion of ambiguous words? contexts. Our evaluation 
of average silhouette values indicates that sense-
79
based clusters in the latent semantic space are not 
very tight (their silhouette values are mostly posi-
tive, but close to zero). However, they are sepa-
rated enough to result in sense discrimination 
accuracy significantly higher than the baseline. We 
also found that the cosine distance measure outper-
forms L1 and L2, and that dimensionality reduc-
tion for sense-based clusters does not improve the 
sense discrimination accuracy. 
 
 
Figure2: Average silhouette values 
 
The clustering  examined in this paper is based on 
pre-established word sense labels, and the meas-
ured accuracy  constitutes an upper bound on a 
sense discrimination accuracy that can be obtained 
by unsupervised clustering such as EM or segmen-
tal K-means. In the next phase of this investigation 
we plan to do a similar evaluation for clustering 
obtained without supervision by running K-means 
algorithm on the same corpus. Since such cluster-
ing is based on geometric properties of word vec-
tors, we expect it to have a better tightness as 
measured by average silhouette value, but, at the 
same time, lower sense discrimination accuracy.  
The experiments reported here are based on LSA 
representation computed using the whole docu-
ment as a context for the ambiguous word. In the 
future we plan to investigate the influence of the 
context size on sense discrimination performance.
