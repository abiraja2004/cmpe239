Abstract 
Although automated word sense disambiguation has become a popular activity within 
computational lexicology, evaluation of the accuracy of disambiguation systems is 
still mostly limited to manual checking by the developer. This paper describes our 
work in collecting data on the disambiguation behavior of human subjects, with 
the intention of providing (I) a norm against which dictionary-based systems (and 
perhaps others) can be evaluated, and (2) a source of psycholinguistic information 
about previously unobserved aspects of human disambiguation, for the use of both 
psycholinguists and computational researchers. We also describe two of our most 
important tools: a questionnaire of ambiguous test words in various contexts, and 
a hypertext user interface for efficient and powerful collection of data from human 
subjects. 
1 The need for a metric of disambiguation 
Research in automatic lexical disambiguation has been going on for decades, and in recent 
years experimental disambiguation systems have proliferated. The problem of determining 
the accuracy of these systems has been little recognized: the usual check for correctness 
is a comparison of the test results against he experimenter's own judgment. Even less 
considered has been the question of what constitutes correctness in disambiguation, be- 
yond the intuitive recognition that some disambiguations are better ("correct") and others 
worse ("incorrect"). 
A common approach to disambiguation is to select among the homographs and senses 
provided by a machine-readable dictionary (e.g. Lesk \[1986\], Byrd \[1989\], Krovetz \[1989\], 
Slator \[1989\], Guthrie et al \[1990\], Ide and Veronis \[1990\], and Veronis and Ide \[1990\]. 
Dictionaries deal with the ambiguity of words by providing multiple definitions for suffi- 
ciently ambiguous words. These multiple definitions may be homographs (distinct words 
of unrelated meaning, whose written forms coincide) or senses (related but nonidentical 
meanings of a single word). 
The inadequacy of a finite, discrete set of sense definitions to resolve all ambiguities 
has been pointed out by Boguraev and Pustejovsky \[1990\], Kilgarriff \[1991\], and Ahlswede 
\[forthcoming\]. For the practical task of disambiguation i  natural anguage processing, 
however, the dictionary is a valuable and convenient source of sense distinctions; in our 
view, the best single source. 
2 Evaluations of Human and Automatic  Disambigua- 
t ion 
Many previous tudies of human disambiguation have been from a psycholinguistic point 
of view. Simpson and Burgess \[1988\], surveying some of these studies, identify three basic 
models of ambiguity processing: (1) restriction by context, (2) ordered access, and (3) 
multiple access. Prather and Swinney \[1988\] consider whether the lexical component of 
human language processing is modular, i.e., acts independently of other components, or 
whether it interacts with other components. 
Computationally oriented evaluations of human disambiguation began as incidental 
adjuncts to computational projects. Amsler and White \[1979\], with the help of assistants, 
manually (i.e., by human judgment) disambiguated the nouns and verbs used in defini- 
tions in the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary. In an informal study, they found that 
their disambiguators' self-consistency on repeat performance was high (84%) but their 
consistency with respect o each other was lower. 
The need for some means of evaluating automatic disambiguation methods, more rig- 
orous than the experimenter's personal judgment, has become more obvious with the 
recent growing interest in the topic. Gale, Church and Yarowsky \[1992\], for instance, 
have followed the approach of estimating upper and lower bounds on the performance of
a system. 
3 Prel iminary experiments 
The project described in this paper began when one of us (Ahlswede) wrote disambiguation 
programs based on those of Lesk \[1986\] and Ide and Veronis \[1990\] for application in 
dictionary and corpus research. Lesk claimed 50-70% accuracy on short samples of literary 
and journalistic input. Ide and Veronis claimed a 90% accuracy rate for their program, 
although they explained that they had tested it against strongly distinct definitions - 
mainly homographs rather than senses. 
After running the programs on test data containing ambiguities at both homograph 
and sense level, and evaluating the results, Ahlswede doubted whether, given this subtler 
mix of ambiguities, even a single human judge would achieve 90% consistency on successive 
evaluations of the same output; moreover, the consistency among multiple judges might 
well be much lower. Ahlswede recruited seven colleagues and friends to evaluate the test 
data, then compared their disambiguations of the test data against each other. The level 
of agreement averaged only 66% among the various human informants, ranging from 31% 
to 88% between pairs of informants \[Ahlswede, forthcoming\]. 
This figure was based on a simple pairwise comparison strategy. The informants rated 
each sense definition of a test word with a "1" indicating that it correctly represented 
the meaning of the word as used in the test text; "-1" if the definition did not correctly 
represent the meaning; and "0" if for any reason the informant could not decide one way 
or the other. 
Pairs of informants were then compared by matching their ratings of the sense defini- 
tions of each word. The pair were considered to agree on a test word if at least one sense 
received a "1" from both informants and if no sense receiving a "1" from either informant 
was given a "-1" by the other. 
This scoring method had the advantage of simplicity, but it did not reflect the agree- 
ment implicit in the rejection as well as the selection of senses by both informants. But the 
relative weight of common rejections and common selections among the senses of a given 
test word depends on the total number of senses, which varies widely. No discrete-valued 
scoring mechanism seems able to solve this problem. 
A pairwise scoring procedure that gives much more plausible results is the coefficient 
of correlation, applied to the parallel evaluations by the informants being compared. It 
clearly distinguishes the relatively high agreement expected from human subjects from the 
relatively low agreement predicted for primitive automatic disambiguation systems, and 
from the more or less random behavior of a control series of random "disambiguations."

Notes: 
1. hl through h7 are human informants; h6 took the test twice. 
. ml  and mla  are implementations of Lesk's algorithm. In mla,  the test texts were 
previously disambiguated for part of speech; senses of inappropriate parts of speech 
were assumed incorrect, and left out of the test data. 
3. m2 is a spreading activation algorithm related to the Ide-Veronis algorithm. 
4. al is a control in which all senses of all test words received a "1". In our first scoring 
strategy, al achieved absurdly high scores. 
5. rand is a control created by randomly scrambling the sequence of answers in one of 
the human samples. 
These results suggested that a very high accuracy rate is not so much unrealistic 
as meaningless: which of the human informants hould the computer agree with, if the 
humans cannot agree among themselves? 
For this reason, the informal experiment has led to the development of a larger and 
more formal test of human disambiguation performance. The main areas of innovation are 
(1) a much more systematically designed questionnaire, to be administered to hundreds of 
subjects rather than only seven, and (2) a user interface to facilitate both the completion 
of the questionnaire by this large number of human subjects, and our analysis of their 
performance. The biggest advantage of a computerized interface is that we can study 
the timing of subjects' responses: valuable information that could not be recorded in the 
original written test. 
Combined with the user interface, the questionnaire is adapted for administration 
to human informants, but it can be adapted with little effort for use with dictionary- 
based disambiguation programs, as was done with its written (but also machine-readable) 
predecessor. 
4 Design of the Questionnaire 
The prototype version of the present questionnaire was a printed list of 100 test texts, 
each with an ambiguous word highlighted and a list of definitions following. Subjects 
typically took the test home, and reported needing anything from half an hour to several 
days to complete the questionnaire. 
The test was difficult to complete for several reasons. The test texts were themselves 
dictionary definitions, chosen at random from the machine-readable version of the Collins 
English Dictionary (CED). (This was because the project grew out of an effort specifically 
to disambiguate definition texts in the CED.) Many of the words being defined by the 
test texts were highly obscure, e.g. 
paduasoy  n. a rich strong silk fabric used for hangings, vestments, etc. 
Or 
I nd ia  paper  n. another name (not in technical usage) for bible paper 
\[Ahlswede and Lorand, 1993\] 
Disambiguation was done (as it still is in the present questionnaire) by choosing one or 
more from a set of dictionary definitions of the highlighted word. This was hard work, and 
volunteers were hard to find. Therefore, though the present version of the questionnaire 
avoids "hard" words except where these are explicitly being studied, it is still tough enough 
that we pay our subjects a small honorarium. 
Like its prototype, the present questionnaire consists of 100 test texts, each with an 
ambiguous test word or short phrase (e.g., ring up, go over). The number 100 was chosen, 
based on our experience with the prototype, as a compromise between a smaller test, 
easier on the subject but less informative, and a larger test which might be prohibitively 
difficult or time-consuming to take. 
5 The Test Texts 
Source. The test texts have been selected in part to represent a wide variety of written 
English, while using a minimum of different sources in order to facilitate comparison 
within each category as well as between categories. The distribution was: 
4 
? 24 General nonfiction (house and garden management tips, extracted from the 
VADisc corpus \[Fox, 1988\]) 
? 24 Fiction (selections from short stories by Mark Twain) 
? 24 Journalism (The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), extracted from the ACL-DCI Corpus 
\[Liberman, 1991\]; 
.? 20 Definitions from the CED \[Collins, 1974\] (selected from definitions used in the 
prototype questionnaire) 
? 8 special texts (constructed to test specific interesting ambiguities) 
One of the original criteria for both test words and test texts, neutrality between 
British and American usage \[Ahlswede, 1992\], was found virtually impossible to maintain. 
The CED is British, and many if not most of its multi-sense ntries include definitions 
of idiomatic British usages. To leave these out would be to risk distorting the results as 
a metric for a disambiguation program that used the CED as a whole without excluding 
those particular definitions. The other categories are American, and in the interest of 
consistency, American idioms were freely permitted as well. 
Several other criteria for selecting test texts were retained and followed: 
1. Difficulty of resolution. This can only be estimated subjectively until the question- 
naire results are in, except for the twenty dictionary definitions, where a rough measure of 
difficulty of resolution is provided by the "coefficient of certainty" \[Ahlswede, forthcom- 
ing\]. 
A second measure, the "coefficient of dissent", specifically measures disagreement as
opposed to uncertainty. The high negative correlation between coefficient of certainty and 
coefficient of dissent (-0.942) indicated that, in practice, there was little difference between 
widespread uncertainty and widespread isagreement. 
Partly because of the apparent lack of importance in this distinction, and partly for 
the convenience ofautomating the questionnaire, the "0" option in the prototype has been 
eliminated. The subject is forced to decide "yes" or "no" to each sense. 
Size of context. The test texts are complete sentences, or (in the case of CED) complete 
definitions. In some cases phrases have been deleted with ellipsis, where the full text 
seemed unmanageably long and the deleted phrase irrelevant to the disambiguation f the 
test word. The net sentence length ranges from 5 to 28 with a median of 14. Results so 
far indicate, as did Lesk's observations, that sentence length does not significantly affect 
performance. 
Global context was early recognized as a potential problem: human disambiguation 
decisions are made not only on the basis of the immediate sentence-level context, but 
also on an awareness of the domain: for instance, the word capital is likely (though not 
certain) to mean one thing in the Wall Street Journal and another thing in a political 
editorial about the federal government. 
Since the test texts are short and have no global context whatever, we compensate 
by adding a small parenthetical note at the end of each text, identifying it as "WSJ", 
"Tips", "CED", "Twain" or "special". The meaning of these short tags is explained to 
the subject, and though not the same as actual global context, they provide explicitly the 
information the reader normally deduces during reading. 
6 The  Test Words  
An factor which is probably important, but impossible to measure, is the familiarity of 
a test word. Two contrasting intuitions about familiarity are (1) an unfamiliar word 
should be harder to disambiguate because its senses are less well known to the informant; 
but (2) a familiar word should be harder because it is likely to have more senses and 
homographs. Since familiarity is not only completely subjective, but also varies widely 
from one individual to another, we turn to a much more measurable criterion: 
Frequency. An unanswered question is whether it is more appropriate to measure word 
frequency based on the specialized corpora from which the texts are extracted, or based 
on a single average word frequency list. The texts taken from the CED, the Wall Street 
Journal, and the "Tips", having been extracted from multi-million-word corpora, can be 
measured separately. Unfortunately, we have no online corpus of Mark Twain's works, 
and the "special" texts are, by definition, not from any corpus at all. 
Part of speech. Studies of disambiguation have focused almost exclusively on nouns, 
verbs and adjectives, and hardly at all on "function words" such as prepositions, con- 
junctions, and those adverbs not derived from adjectives. (An exception is Brugman and 
Lakoff \[1988\], who study the word over.) We are interested in in both kinds of words. 
Therefore the test words include 28 nouns, 22 verbs, 19 adjectives, 16 adverbs (none in 
-ly), and 15 assorted prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns. 
Given the combination of a British dictionary with such ultra-American sources as 
Mark Twain, we were unable to guarantee variety neutrality in our test words as in our 
test texts. An alternative, however, was to include among the "special" texts two with 
strong variety bias: I took the tube to the repair shop, ambiguous in British but not in 
American, and It was a long and unpleasant fall,, ambiguous in American hut not (or less 
so) in British. These were added in the hope that native or learned speakers of British 
English would handle them differently than speakers of American English. 
7 The  User  Inter face 
An important feature of the questionnaire is its user interface. This was developed by one 
of us (Lorand) in Macintosh HyperCard. 
The interface consists of four principal modules ("stacks" in hypertext erminology): 
(1) a top-level stack that drives the interface as a whole; (2) a "demographics" tack that 
manages a menu of demographic and identifying information that the subject fills out; (3) 
the "import questionnaire" stack, which allows the questionnaire to exist independently 
of the interface as an editable text file, and to be reinserted into the interface as desired, 
e.g., after changes have been made; (4) the questionnaire itself, translated automatically 
into MetaTalk, the MetaCard programming language. 
8 The  demograph ics  stack 
The menu of the demographics stack first solicits non-identifying portions of the subject's 
Social Security number and birthday, which are hashed to form a unique, confidential ID 
for that subject. The menu then solicits potentially relevant demographic nformation: 
age, gender, native/non-native speaker of English, number of years speaking English if 
non-native, and highest educational degree. This last is an extremely rough measure 
of literacy, but no better one is available, and the preliminary experiment showed that 
doctoral-level subjects agreed more closely with each other than the non-doctoral subjects 
did either with the doctorates or with each other \[Ahlswede, forthcoming\]. 
The ID and the demographic information are written to a text file in numerically coded 
form. The subject may then begin the questionnaire or cancel. 
9 The questionnaire stack 
The questionnaire is implemented as a series of windows, one for each test text and its 
associated efinitions. The test text is displayed at the top of the window, with the test 
word in boldface. Below is a subwindow containing the definitions. The subject clicks on 
a definition to identify it as a good disambiguation; the typeface of the selected efinition 
changes to boldface. Clicking on a selected definition will de-select it and its typeface 
will change back to regular. Any number of definitions may be selected. If, as sometimes 
happens, there are too many definitions to fit within the subwindow, it can be scrolled 
up and down to give access to all the definitions. Arrow buttons at the bottom right and 
bottom left enable the subject to go ahead to the next text or back to the previous one. 
Every action by the subject is logged, as is its time, in the log file. Thus when the 
subject is done, we have a complete record of his or her actions, of the time at which each 
action took place, and thus of the interval between each pair of actions. 
10 The Subjects 
So far, most of the subjects recruited have been students, with some faculty and staff. 
We are presently recruiting off campus. Probably thanks to the honorarium, response 
has been enthusiastic: well over the 100 subjects we considered necessary for an adequate 
sample. Because we are still occupied with data collection, intensive analysis of the data 
has not begun yet. 
11 Conclusions 
As we administer the questionnaire, we are developing approaches to the analysis of the 
resulting data. When we have acquired a large enough collection of performances, we will 
begin formal analysis. 
Our first concern in this effort has been to develop a useful corpus or set of "norms" 
of human disambiguation behavior, against which automatic disambiguation systems, at 
least those based on machine-readable dictionaries, can be compared. We also believe, 
however, that our results will be interesting to psycholinguists studying human disam- 
biguation: since our approach as been different from previous psycholinguistic experi- 
ments, we expect hat considerable new knowledge will emerge from the data we are now 
gathering.
