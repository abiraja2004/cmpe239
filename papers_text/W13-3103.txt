Abstract
The MultiLing 2013 Workshop of ACL
2013 posed a multi-lingual, multi-
document summarization task to the
summarization community, aiming to
quantify and measure the performance of
multi-lingual, multi-document summa-
rization systems across languages. The
task was to create a 240?250 word sum-
mary from 10 news articles, describing
a given topic. The texts of each topic
were provided in 10 languages (Arabic,
Chinese, Czech, English, French, Greek,
Hebrew, Hindi, Romanian, Spanish) and
each participant generated summaries
for at least 2 languages. The evaluation
of the summaries was performed using
automatic and manual processes. The
participating systems submitted over 15
runs, some providing summaries across
all languages. An automatic evaluation
task was also added to this year?s set
of tasks. The evaluation task meant to
determine whether automatic measures
of evaluation can function well in the
multi-lingual domain. This paper provides
a brief description related to the data of
both tasks, the evaluation methodology, as
well as an overview of participation and
corresponding results.
1 Introduction
The MultiLing Pilot introduced in TAC 2011
was a combined community effort to present
and promote multi-document summarization ap-
poraches that are (fully or partly) language-neutral.
This year, in the MultiLing 2013 Workshop of
ACL 2013, the effort grew to include a total of
10 languages in a multi-lingual, multi-document
summarization corpus: Arabic, Czech, English,
French, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi from the old cor-
pus, plus Chinese, Romanian and Spanish as new
additions. Furthermore, the document set in exist-
ing languages was extended by 5 new topics. We
also added a new track aiming to work on evalu-
ation measures related to multi-document summa-
rization, similarly to the AESOP task of the recent
Text Analysis Conferences.
This document describes:
? the tasks and the data of the multi-document
multilingual summarization track;
? the evaluation methodology of the participat-
ing systems (Section 2.3);
? the evaluation track of MultiLing (Section 3).
? The document is concluded (Section 4) with a
summary and future steps related to this spe-
cific task.
The first track aims at the real problem of sum-
marizing news topics, parts of which may be de-
scribed or happen in different moments in time.
The implications of including multiple aspects of
the same event, as well as time relations at a vary-
ing level (from consequtive days to years), are still
difficult to tackle in a summarization context. Fur-
thermore, the requirement for multilingual appli-
cability of the methods, further accentuates the dif-
ficulty of the task.
The second track, summarization evaluation,
is related the corresponding, prominent research
problem of how to automatically evaluate a sum-
mary. While commonly used methods build upon
a few human summaries to be able to judge au-
tomatic summaries (e.g., (Lin, 2004; Hovy et al,
2005)), there also exist works on fully automatic
evaluation of summaries, without human?model?
summaries (Louis and Nenkova, 2012; Saggion
et al, 2010). The Text Analysis Conference has
a separate track, named AESOP (e.g. see (Dang
20
and Owczarzak, 2009)) aiming to test and evaluate
different automatic evaluation methods of summa-
rization systems. We perform a similar task, but in
a multilingual setting.
2 Multi-document multi-lingual
summarization track
In the next paragraphs we describe the task, the
corpus, the evaluation methodology and the results
related to the summarization track of MultiLing
2013.
2.1 The summarization task
This MultiLing task aims to evaluate the appli-
cation of (partially or fully) language-independent
summarization algorithms on a variety of lan-
guages. Each system participating in the task was
called to provide summaries for a range of different
languages, based on corresponding corpora. In the
MultiLing Pilot of 2011 the languages used were 7,
while this year systems were called to summarize
texts in 10 different languages: Arabic, Chinese,
Czech, English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi,
Romanian, Spanish. Participating systems were
required to apply their methods to a minimum of
two languages.
The task was aiming at the real problem of sum-
marizing news topics, parts of which may be de-
scribed or may happen in different moments in
time. We consider, similarly to MultiLing 2011
(Giannakopoulos et al, 2011) that news topics can
be seen as event sequences:
Definition 1 An event sequence is a set of atomic
(self-sufficient) event descriptions, sequenced in
time, that share main actors, location of occurence
or some other important factor. Event sequences
may refer to topics such as a natural disaster, a
crime investigation, a set of negotiations focused
on a single political issue, a sports event.
The summarization task requires to generate a
single, fluent, representative summary from a set
of documents describing an event sequence. The
language of the document set will be within the
given range of 10 languages and all documents in a
set share the same language. The output summary
should be of the same language as its source doc-
uments. The output summary should be between
240 and 250 words.
2.2 Summarization Corpus
The summarization corpus is based on a gath-
ered English corpus of 15 topics (10 of which
were already available fromMultiLing 2011), each
containing 10 texts. Each topic contains at least
one event sequence. The English corpus was then
translated to all other languages (see also (Li et
al., 2013; Elhadad et al, 2013)), trying to gener-
ate sentence-parallel translations.
The input documents generated are UTF8-
encoded, plain text files. The whole set of trans-
lated documents together with the original English
document set will be referred to as the Source Doc-
ument Set. Given the creation process, the Source
Document Set contains a total of 1350 texts (650
more than the corpus of the MultiLing 2011 Pilot):
7 languages (Arabic, Czech, English, Greek, ) with
15 topics per language and 10 texts per topic for a
total of 1050 texts; 3 languages (Chinese, French,
Hindi) with 10 topics per language and 10 texts per
topic for a total of 300 texts.
The non-Chinese texts had an average word
length of approximately 350 words (and a standard
deviation of 224 words). Since words in Chinese
cannot be counted easily, the Chinese text length
was based on the byte length of the correspond-
ing files. Thus, Chinese texts had an average byte
length of 1984 bytes (and a standard deviation of
1366 bytes). The ratio of average words in non-
Chinese texts to average bytes in Chinese texts
shows that on average one may (simplisticly) ex-
pect that 6 bytes of Chinese text are adequate to
express one word from a European language.
We note that the measurement of Chinese text
length in words proved a very difficult endeavour.
In the future we plan to use specialized Chinese
tokenizers, which have an adequately high perfor-
mance that will allowmeasuring text and summary
lengths in words more accurately.
2.3 Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation of results was perfromed both
automatically and manually. The manual evalu-
ation was based on the Overall Responsiveness
(Dang and Owczarzak, 2008) of a text. For the
manual evaluation the human evaluators were pro-
vided the following guidelines:
Each summary is to be assigned an
integer grade from 1 to 5, related to the
overall responsiveness of the summary.
We consider a text to be worth a 5, if
21
it appears to cover all the important as-
pects of the corresponding document set
using fluent, readable language. A text
should be assigned a 1, if it is either un-
readable, nonsensical, or contains only
trivial information from the document
set. We consider the content and the
quality of the language to be equally im-
portant in the grading.
The automatic evaluation was based on human,
model summaries provided by fluent speakers of
each corresponding language (native speakers in
the general case). ROUGE variations (ROUGE-
1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-3, ROUGE-4) (Lin, 2004)
and the AutoSummENG-MeMoG (Giannakopou-
los et al, 2008; Giannakopoulos and Karkalet-
sis, 2011) and NPowER (Giannakopoulos and
Karkaletsis, 2013) methods were used to automat-
ically evaluate the summarization systems. Within
this paper we provide results based on ROUGE-2
and MeMoG methods.
2.4 Participation and Overview of Results
This section provides a per-language overview
of participation and of the evaluation results.
For an overview of participation information see
Table 1. In the table, one can find the mapping
between participant teams and IDs, as well as per
language information. An asterisk in a cell indi-
cates systems of co-organizers for the specific lan-
guage. These systems had early access to the cor-
pus for their language and, thus, had an advantage
over others on that specific language.
Moreover, for the MultiLing pilot we created
two systems, one acting as a global baseline (Sys-
tem ID6) and the other as a global topline (System
ID61). These two systems are described briefly in
the following paragraphs.
2.5 Baseline/Topline Systems
The two systems devised as pointers of a stan-
dard, simplistic approach and of an approach tak-
ing into account human summaries were imple-
mented as follows.
The global baseline system?ID6? represents
the documents of a topic in vector space using a
bag-of-words approach. Then it determines the
centroidC of the document set in that space. Given
the centroid, the system gets the text T that is most
similar to the centroid (based on the cosine simi-
larity) and uses it in the summary. If the text ex-
ceeds the summary word limit, then only a part of
it is used to provide the summary. Otherwise, the
whole text is added as summary text. If the sum-
mary is below the lower word limit, the process is
repeated iteratively adding the next most similar
document to the centroid.
The global topline system ? ID61 ? uses the
(human) model summaries as a given (thus cheat-
ing). These documents are represented in the vec-
tor space similarly to the global baseline. Then,
an algorithm produces random summaries by com-
bining sentences from the original texts. The sum-
maries are evaluated by their cosine similarity to
the centroid of the model summaries.
We use the centroid score as a fitness measure
in a genetic algorithm process. The genetic algo-
rithm fitness function also penalizes summaries of
out-of-limit length. Thus, what we do is that we
search, using a genetic algorithm process, through
the space of possible summaries, to produce one
that mostly matches (an average representation of)
the model summaries. Of course, using an in-
termediate, centroid representation, loses part of
the information in the original text. Through this
method we want to see how well we can create
summaries by knowing a priori what (on average)
must be included.
Unfortunately, the sentence splitting module of
the topline, based on the Apache OpenNLP li-
brary1 statistical sentence splitted failed due to a
bug in our code. This resulted in an interesting
phenomenon: the system would maximize sim-
ilarity to the centroid, using fragments of sen-
tences. This is actually an excellent way to ex-
amine what types of text can cheat n-gram based
methods that they are good, while remaining just-
not-good-enough from a human perspective. In the
system performance analysis sections we will see
that this expectation holds.
In the Tables of the following sectionwe provide
MeMoG and Overall Responsiveness (OR) statis-
tics per system and language. We also provide in-
formation on statistically significant performance
differences (based on Tukey HSD tests).
2.6 Language-specific Tables
The tables below illustrate the system per-
formances per language. Each table contains
three columns: ?Group?, ?SysID? and ?Avg Perf?.
The Group column indicates to which statistically

equivalent groups of performance a system be-
longs. If two systems belong to the same group,
they do not have statistically significant differ-
ences in their performance (95% confidence level
of Tukey?s HSD test). The SysID column indicates
the system ID and the ?Avg Perf? column the av-
erage performance of the system in the given lan-
guage. The caption of each table indicates what
measure was used to grade performance. In the
Overall Responsiveness (OR) tables we also pro-
vide the grades assigned to human summarizers.
We note that for two of the languages ? French,
Hindi ? there were no human evaluations this
year, thus there are no OR tables for these lan-
guages. At the time of writing of this paper, there
were also no evaluations for human summaries for
the Hebrew and the Romanian languages. These
data are planned to be included in an extended
technical report, whichwill bemade available after
the workshop at the MultiLing Community web-
site2, as an addenum to the proceedings.
There are several notable findings in the tables:

reached human level performance.
? The centroid baseline performed very well in
several cases (e.g., Spanish, Arabic), while
rather badly in others (e.g., Czech).
? The cheating topline system did indeed man-
age to reveal a blind-spot of automatic evalu-
ation, achieving high MeMoG grades, while
performing badly in terms of OR grade.
We note that detailed results related to the per-
formances of the participants will be made avail-
able via the MultiLing website3.
3 Automatic Evaluation track
In the next paragraphs we describe the task, the
corpus and the evaluation methodology related to
the automatic summary evaluation track of Multi-
Ling 2013.
3.1 The Evaluation Task
This task aims to examine how well automated
systems can evaluate summaries from different
languages. This task takes as input the summaries
generated from automatic systems and humans in
the Summarization Task. The output should be a
grading of the summaries. Ideally, we would want
the automatic evaluation to maximally correlate to
human judgement.
3.2 Evaluation Corpus
Based on the Source Document Set, a number
of human summarizers and several automatic sys-
tems submitted summaries for the different top-
ics in different languages. The human summaries
were considered model summaries and were pro-
vided, together with the source texts and the auto-
matic summaries, as input to summary evaluation
systems. There were a total of 405 model sum-
maries and 929 automatic summaries (one system
did not submit summaries for all the topics). Each
topic in each language was mapped to 3 model
summaries.
The question posed in the multi-lingual con-
text is whether an automatic measure is enough
to provide a ranking of systems. In order to an-
swer this question we used the ROUGE-2 score,
as well as the ?n-gram graph?-based methods (Au-
toSummENG, MeMoG, NPowER) to grade sum-
maries. We used ROUGE-2 because it has been ro-
bust and highly used for several years in the DUC
3See http://multiling.iit.demokritos.gr
and TAC communities. There was only one ad-
ditional participating measure for the evaluation
track ? namely the Coverage measure ? in ad-
dition to the above methods.
In order to measure correlation we used
Kendall?s Tau, to see whether grading with the au-
tomatic or the manual grades would cause differ-
ent rankings (and how different). The results of
the correlation per language are indicated in Ta-
ble 19. Unfortunately, the Hebrew evaluation data
were not fully available at the time of writing and,
thus, they could not be used. Please check the tech-
nical report tha twill be available after the comple-
tion of the Workshop for more information4.
4 Summary and Future Directions
Overall, the MultiLing 2013 multi-document
summarization and summary evaluation tasks
aimed to provide a scientifically acceptable bench-
mark setting for summarization systems. Building
upon previous community effort we managed to
achieve two main aims of the MultiLing Pilot of
2011 (Giannakopoulos et al, 2011): we managed
to increase the number of languages included to 10
and increase the number of topics per language.
We should also note that the addition of Chinese
topics offered a fresh set of requirements, related
to the differences of writing in this specific lan-
guage from writing in the rest of the languages in
the corpus: not even tokenization is easy to transfer
to Chinese from other,e.g. European languages.
The main lessons learned from the multi-
document and evaluation tracks were the follow-
ing:
? multi-document summarization is an active
domain of research.
? current systems seem to performwell-enough
to provide more than basic, acceptable ser-
vices to humans in a variety of languages.
However, there still exist challenging lan-
guages.
? there are languages where systems achieved
human-grade performance.
? automatic evaluation of summaries in differ-
ent languages in far from an easy task. Much
more effort must be put in this direction, to
facilitate summarization research.

The main steps we plan to take, based also on
the future steps inherited from the MultiLing Pilot
of 2011 are:
? to find the funds required for the evaluation
process, in order to support the quality of the
endeavour.
? to use the top performing evaluation system
as the main evaluationmeasure in futureMul-
tiLing workshops.
? to create a piece of support software that will
help implement and track all corpus genera-
tion processes.
? to study the possibility of breaking down the
summarization process and asking systems
to make individual components available as
(web) services to other systems. This prac-
tice aims to allow combinations of different
components into new methods.
? to check the possibility of using the corpus for
cross-language summarization. We can either
have the task of generating a summary in a
different language than the source documents,
or/and use multi-language source documents
on a single topic to provide a summary in one
target language.
? to start a track aiming to measure the effec-
tiveness of multi-lingual summarization as a
commercial service to all the world. This
track would need a common interface, hid-
ing the underlying mechanics from the user.
The user, in turn, will be requested to judge a
summary based on its extrinsic value. Much
conversation needs to be conducted in order
for this task to provide a meaningful compar-
ison between systems. The aim of the track
would be to illustrate the current applicability
of multilingual multi-document summariza-
tion systems in a real-world task, aiming at
non-expert users.
Overall, the MultiLing effort enjoys the con-
tribution of a flourishing research community on
multi-lingual summarization research. We need to
continue building on this contribution, inviting and
challenging more researchers to participate in the
community. So far we have seen the MultiLing ef-
fort grow from a pilot to a workshop, encompass-
ing more and more languages and research groups
under a common aim: providing a commonly ac-
cepted benchmark setting for current and future
multi-lingual summarization systems.
