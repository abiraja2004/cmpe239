2 The Center List Model 
In this section, centering is cxtcndc'd to handle

to handle over(, pronouns. Finally, the ordering; ot'm> 
t.ities for showing the degree of salience is &mcril)ed. 
115 1 
2.1 Zero -Pronouns  
In Kameyama's account, only one zero-pronoun 
encodes the Cb, and any otl~er zero-pronouns be- 
come Cfs, just as if they had been overtly ex- 
pressed in the sentence. In other words, when there 
are multiple zero-pronouns, only one of the zero- 
pronouns has any significance, and ally other zero- 
pronoun might as well have been overtly expressed. 
But, because entities become zero-pronouns in or- 
der to avoid unnaturalness due to redundancy, zero- 
pronouns can be said to be salient enough to be un- 
derstood without being overt. Iu effect, this means 
that a greater amount of attention is placed on them 
than entities that were overtly expressed. This is 
shown through an example. 
Taking her approach, some simple extensions are 
made to see how well the ordering of entities in cen- 
tering would work for multiple zero-pronouns. First, 
the antecedent for the Cb-eueoding zero-pronoun is
chosen.as hown in \[Kameyama 85\]. Basically, this 
consists of choosing the entity with the highest de- 
gree of salience in the previous sentence. Then, the 
next most salient zero-pronoun according to the or- 
dering of degrees of salience given in the previous 
section is considered. The antecedent for this zero- 
pronoun is the most salient entity fi'om the previ- 
ous sentence which will not contradict any possible 
constraints. At this point, we only consider seman- 
tic constraints for excluding such sentences as "The 
desk ate fish" and contra-index constraints for ex- 
cluding such sentences as "Jack ate Jack." Any other 
zero-pronouns are handled in tile same manner. For 
example, the following discourse is examinedl: 
Example 1: 
(1) Taro wa Jiro to shokuji chuu de atta. 
Taro Top/Sub airo with meal during was 
Taro was h.avin 9 a meal wilh. airo. 
Cb: - - ,  Cf: Taro > .}ire 
(2) @ Saburo we mikaketa. 
Sub Saburo Obj saw 
(Taw) saw SabTtro. 
Cb: Taro, Cf: Saburo 
(3) ~ ? airo ni shoukaishita. 
Sub Obj Jiro Obj2 introduced 
(Taro) introduced (5'aburo) to Jiro. 
(4) ? q' Shokuji ni sasotta. 
Sub Obj meal Obj2 invited 
(Taw) invited (Sal, uro) to lhe meal. 
1 "?5" denotes zero-pronouns, and Top, Sub, Obj, Obj2 de~ 
notes Topic, Subject, Object, and Object2, respectively. 
In sentence (1), tile Cfs are ordered as Taro > Jiro, 
since Topic is the most salient entity. In sentence (2), 
the entity with the highest degree of salience fi'o,n 
the previous sentence (Taro) is chosen as tile zero- 
pronoun's antecedent, and becomes the Cb, with 
Saburo becoming a Cf. In tile third sentence, after 
Taro is chosen as the subject of the sentence, since 
there is only Saburo left,, Saburo becomes the an- 
tecedent of tile object zero-pronoun, assuming that 
there is some sort of knowledge preventing Taro from 
becoming the object. 
After sentence (3), the ordering of noun phrases 
would be as follows: 
Taro (Cb) > Jiro (Cf- Obj2) = Saburo (Cf- Oh j) 
This means that sentence (4) is ambiguous, having 
tile following possible interpretations: 
(a) Taro invited Jiro to the meal. 
(b) Taro invited Saburo to the rneal. 
But, the preferred meaning is (b). So, this would 
mean that the ordering should be as follows: 
Taro > Eaburo > Jiro 
This example shows that when trying to interpret 
more than one zero-pronoun, the ordering of noun 
phrases according to Kameyama's acconnt may not 
be optimal. Of course, this can be rectified by chang- 
ing the ordering of the degree of salience so that Ob- 
ject is higher than Object2, and as noted later in the 
paper this will actually take place. But, suppose sen- 
tence (3) in Example 2 is replaced with the following 
sentence:  
(3') q5 '-b Jiro we shoukaishita. 
Sub Obj2 airo Obj introduced 
(Ta,,)  i,,.t,~od,,ce~ ai,'o (to S,,b,,,'o). 
Even in this case, the interpretation of sentence 
(4) would not change 2. So, the ordering of zero- 
pronoun not being optimal, i.e. that zero-pronouns 
are more likely to become zero-pronouns again than 
overt noun phrases, would seeln to be the more log- 
ical choice. 
So, we propose that "entities that have become 
zero-pronouns are more centered in tile discourse 
than those that have been overtly expressed." There- 
fore, tile centering model has been extended to tile 
following two lists to handle entities (noun phrases) 
that appear in a sentence: 
~Althougb it should be noted that it doesn't  seem to be ,as 
strongly preferred as before. 
1752 
(1) Center  L is t  . .. Entit ies in asentence that have 
becolne zero-\])rOllOtlns. 
(2)  Poss ib le  Center  List; ? . .  Entit ies in a sentence. 
that  were overtly exl)ressed. 
2 .2  P ronouns  
In Japanese, both overt and elided t)ronondnal 
forms exist. The elided l)rOl,Ominal forl'Ll (zero- 
pronoun) was discussed in the previous subsection. 
In this subsection, we will show how pronouns are 
handled within tile proposed nlodel. 
ill Kanleyatnlat~s acco/lnt, \])ronollltS do ltot elicode 
Cbs and can only become C\[~s. If overt pronouns 
are treated as entit ies that were overtly expressed 
(i.e. put in the Possibh'. Center I,ist), the \[blk)wing 
example will not l)e interpreted correctly a. 
l'~xanq)le 2: 
(1) Taro wa Jiro to hatnatshiteitat. 
Taro ' l 'op/Sub J iro with talking 
"l'(Iro was lalL"~ng wilh Jiro. 
CL:.  -, 1)(211,:'l'atro > 3ire 
(2) (it \[lanatko we nfikaketa. 
Sub llatnako ()bj saw 
(Taro) saw llaua,(:o. 
eL:  'l'aro, PCI,: l lanako 
(3) ~ 3ire ni kaatojo nituite hanashita.  
Sub 3 i roOb j2  her about talked 
(7'are) lalked to Jiro abottl hcr (Ilanako). 
CL: Taro, PCI,: J iro > l lauako 
(4) (l~ ?l) Suki naatodcarl,. 
Sub Obj like is 
('/'.,',,) li~:~.,~ (Ha,,,~o). 
If this example is interl)reted with tit(', antecedent 
of kanojo (her) in sentence (3) in the Possible (.:eat- 
ter List, then tile interpretat ion would be 'Tatro likes 
3iro.' \[n order to obtain the preferred interpretat ion, 
the ordering of noun phrases should be as follows: 
Taro > llauako > .lifo 
'l'his example shows that pronoul,s are not n(~ccs- 
sadly at the same level as with other overt noun 
phrases. Ill other words, prollouns atre atl. at. level of 
attent ion higher than 'ordinary'  noun phrases. This 
is especially true when considering tile fact that pro- 
llOllIIS are used to preven\[; nnl/aturathless dllc l.o re- 
dundancy, just as zero-prononiis are used. 
a'CL' strums for Center 1,ist., alld '|)('1,' stands for Possible 
Center Lisl,. 
So, we propose that pronouns be interl)reted at 
the same level as zero-pronouns as follows: 
C (mter  L is t  Mode l  
The entit ies in a sentence llelong to one of 
tile tbllowing two lists: 
(1) Cei l teF  L is t  . . .  l';ntities that  have. 
become zeroq)ronouns or overt l)rc ~ 
notlns. 
(2) Poss ib le  Center  L is t  . . .  Entit ies 
that were overtly expressed but ~tre 
not in the Center List. 
Entit ies ill the Center l,ist are more salient 
than those in the l)ossihle Center List, with 
tile exception of '\['opic. 
The exceptkm will be touched nllon in the next sub-. 
section. 
2 .3  Order ing  by  Sa l ience  
Next comes the problenl of ordering witl,in the 
Center l,ist and the Possible Center List. in other 
words, the difference in salience between pronouns 
(zero and ow;rt) and 'ordinary'  noun phrases is 
shown by the Center List and the Possible Center 
last. l,'ntities in the Center List are lnore sMient 
than those in the Possible Center List. But, what 
about t, tl<" difference ill salie.nce within each list? 
In our model, the ordering is as follows: 
'l'opic > Subject > Object > Object2 > Others 
> Subject/Ol~ject/Ol~ject2 of subordinate clause 
> Others ill Sllbordill~Jt;(! clause 
The tirst line shows tile ordering of grammatical  
functions of the main verh. This line is basically the 
same as l (ameyama's  ordering, except that  Object is 
deemed to be more salient than Object2. This was 
because, after making some prelhninary evaluations 
of our model, Object was Rmnd to have at slightly 
higher degree of salience than Object2. 
The following two lines are for ally entit ies that 
atpl)car in subordinate (:l~mses. '\['here doesn't  seem 
to be at clear cut difference between the Subject, Ob- 
ject, and Obje.ct2 of subordinatte clauses, so they are 
Ilcmdled at the same level. The difference between 
the lnain clause and any sul)ordinate clauses cap- 
tures the intuition that entit ies in the main chmse 
are. more s~dient han those in subordinate ones. 
There is one exception to the Center List Model. 
It is tile salience of the Topic in the Possible Center 
1153 
List. As can be surmised from the term itself, tim 
'Fopie is special in that the sentence contains infor- 
mation about the entity corresponding to the Topic. 
In other words, the sentence is usually about the 
3bpicalized entity. So, it was placed at. the same 
level as the Object in the Center List. 
3 Exper iment  and  Discuss ion  
An experiment was done to show the effectiveness 
of the Center last Model in interpreting pronouns 
and zero-pronouns. A total of 160 sentences from 
the following four discourses were used: 
? "Ushikata To Yainanba" \[Tsul)ota 75\] (Japanese 
folklore - 70 sentences) 
? "Madogiwa No Totto-clmn" \[Kuroyanagi 81\] 
(Story--- 51 sentences) 
? "Yasei Doubutsu '.I'o Tomoni" (Newspaper col- 
Hllln) 
- "Baison" \[Obara 91\] (15 sentences) 
- "h'ie Wani"\[Obara 92\] (24 sentences) 
This section will first describe the simple imple- 
nlentation used in the experiment. Then, it is eval- 
uated (Table 1), followed by a eonll,a.rison (Table 2) 
with Kameyama's method. 
3 .1  Imp lementat ion  
The implementation is kept simple to demonstrate 
the eft'eel of the Center List. Semantic onstraints on 
the type of entity that a (zero) pronoun may refer to 
-- for example, the Subject of 'eat'  must be animate 
-, and contra-index constraints for restricting combi- 
nations of eoreferring entities within a sentence - for 
example, tile Subject and Object of 'eat.' cannot be 
the same entity - are used. In addMon, a constraint 
concerning tire subject and identification 4 of Cbs in 
adjacent sentences i used \[Kameyama 86\], except it 
applies to each entity in the Center List of adjacent 
sentences as follows: 
Two zero-pronouns that appear ill the Cell- 
ter List of adjacent sentences should share 
one of the following properties (in descend- 
ing order of pret?rence): ( l)  id'entitication 
and subject, (2) identification only, (3) sub- 
ject only, (4) non-identification and not> 
subject. 
41(ameymna's terminology for l~mpathy \[Kuno 78\]. It 
shows the perspective from which an event is described. 
Of course, tire Center List and the Possible Cen- 
ter List by themselves will not be able to handle an- 
tecedents that arc not in the previous sentence. In 
order to solve this problem, an ad hoc approach was 
taken by adding the following two lists: 
? Past Center List ... Entities that have previ- 
ously been a zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun, 
but do not appear in the current sentence. 
? Noun List ... Entities that have never been a 
zero-pronoun or an overt pronoun. 
In order to avoid combinatorial explosion, the enti- 
ties that are held in these two lists are limited to 
those which appear in the previous three sentences. 
Each entity in the four lists is assigned a score to 
show its degree of salience. In other words, tbe score 
shows the possibility of beconfing a zero (or overt) 
pronoun in the next sentence. 
After morphological nd syntactic analysis, the in- 
terpretation process is basically carried out as fol- 
lows: 
(1) Using the semantic constraints, possible an- 
tecedents for pronouns and zeroq)ronouns are 
found from the Center List, Possible Center 
List, Past Center last, and Nolln List. 
(2) Combinations of possible antecedents are made. 
(3) Contra-index constraints are applied. 
(4) Each combination is given a score as follows: 
(4.l) Compute the sum of the scores that each 
possible antecedent was given. 
(4.2) Give bonus scores according to the subject 
and identification constraint. 
(5) The combination with the highest score is ch{> 
sell as the combination with the inost probable 
antecedents. 
(6) The Center List, Possible Center List, etc. are 
updated. 
3.2 Eva luat ion  
Table 1 shows our results. Considering tile fact 
that t, he Center List Model itself handles only pro- 
not lns ~tnd gero -prono l lns  whose ~tnteeedents are 
found one sentence back, it shows promise since a 
very simple fi'amework is enough to achieve 76% ac- 
curacy. Also, though tile number of pronouns was 
small, tile percentage of correct interpretations was

There was one case where her approach was able 
to make a correct interpretation but ours could not. 
This, however, was a false positive. 
While all other differences between the two ap- 
proaches were cases where our approach was able to 
handle the interpretation but hers could not, three 
of the cases were not clue to a legitimate superior- 
ity of our approach. In one case, an error occurred 
due to error-chaining. In mini.her, the cause was 
the exclusion of the interpretation of the Oblique- 
Object in p~ssive sentences fi'om the evaluation of 
Kameyama's approach. The third case was the sin- 
gle false-positive tha.t occurred in the result of our 
approach, llowever, all other (sevell) cases were (\[tie 
to the salience ordering difference between the Ceu- 
ter List Model and Centering. 
Tim evaluation model was limited to a. very simple 
one so that the etfect of the Center List, i.e. the 
difference in ordering, would be apparent. Fronl tile 
comparison, the Center List Model can be said to 
order the possible antecedents more effectively than 
Kameyama's method. 
4 Conc lus ion  
In this paper, centering was extended to better 
interpret pronoulrs and zero-pronouns. It, extended 
the centering model to have two lists. The Center 
List holds entities that 'appeared' in the sentence as 
either an overt pronoun or a zero-pronoun. The Pos- 
sible Center List holds entities that overtly appeared 
in the sentence, excluding overt pronouns. 
A very simple implementation showed that 76% 
of pronouns and zero-pronouns could be interpreted. 
'\['he percentage goes up to 81% when considering 
only those whose antecedents are one sentence back. 
But, as the figures indicate, a more global frame- 
work, such as one descrihed in \[Grosz 86\], is needed.
