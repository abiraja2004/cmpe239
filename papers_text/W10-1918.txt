Abstract 
Early recognition of distinguishing pat-
terns of a novel pandemic disease is im-
portant. We introduce a methodological 
approach based on popular data mining 
techniques to extract key features and 
temporal patterns of swine (h1n1) flu that 
is discriminated from swine flu like 
symptoms. 
1 Introduction 
Early recognition of a novel pandemic is desira-
ble to minimize its dissemination. However, it 
usually spends some time in developing a diag-
nostic test and people tend to omit the test for 
various reasons including cost, which leads to 
late recognition. Under these circumstances, 
symptoms and signs in clinical documents might 
be valuable indicators to have a population pers-
pective on pandemic severity.  
In this paper, we propose a methodological 
approach to extract features of swine(h1n1) flu 
distinctive to swine flu like patients? one.  
2  Method 
2.1 Data 
 We randomly selected twenty clinical docu-
ments from first visit records of patients who had 
visited emergency room in Seoul National Uni-
versity Hospital (SNUH) with suspected case of 
swine flu. Ten of the documents are RT-PCR test 
positive cases, which mean that the patient is 
swine flu infected patient, while the ten remain-
ing documents are RT-PCR negative cases. Each 
document contains a patient?s symptoms, obser-
vations, recent clinical histories, clinical plans, 
and diagnoses in natural language. The symp-
toms are mostly about upper respiratory infection 
related ones but some of the sample documents 
describe about ones related to other diseases.   
2.2 Hypotheses 
We hypothesized two things as follows. 1) We 
will be able to extract distinctive symptom set 
between swine flu and swine-flu like patients by 
adopting apriori association rule mining method. 
2) Although the two target groups accompany 
similar symptoms, we will be able to make se-
lected symptoms more discriminative by devel-
oping impact score and considering temporal 
aspects, development rate. 
2.3  Distinguishing Symptoms Extraction 
We modeled each clinical document as one (tag, 
 item1, ?, itemn) transaction of which tag and 
items indicate RT-PCR result and candidate fea-
tures, respectively. We set symptoms, signs, tra-
vel, and contact information as candidate fea-
tures. We divided target data into three groups 
(Table 1) and ran apriori association rule algo-
rithm to produce rules associated with RT-
PCR(+) or RT-PCR(-) cases. Then the items ap-
peared in association rules are collected. The 
items are grouped into four sets according to 
their original rules and training data (Table 2). 
The union of Ipos and Ipos_co was regarded as a 
distinguishing feature set, If. To enhance discrim-
ination ability, we used some weights to score 
them as shown in Table 2 and 3. 
Input data set Description  
Data 1 10 h1n1 positive transactions 
Data 2 10 h1n1 negative transactions 
Data 3 10 h1n1 positive transactions 
+ 10 h1n1 negative transactions

2.4 Disease Development Pattern Analysis 
 We extracted temporal information of selected 
features in sample documents and modeled as 
interval constraints. We ran Floyd-Warshall?s 
all-pairs-shortest path algorithm to get hidden 
temporal relationships between two features. We 
traced start time gaps of the features to compare 
temporal patterns of the development rate of ex-
ternal indicators between two data sets, Data1 
and Data2. 
3 Result  
For input data, we produced transactions and ini-
tial temporal constraint network manually. We 
extracted distinctive feature set, applied our scor-
ing method, and compared temporal aspects. 
We limited support value threshold as 30% for 
Ipos and Ineg and 0% for Ipos_co and Ineg_co 
due to small data size. Eight signs and symptoms 
as well as travel information were extracted from 
47 items as distinguishing features of swine flu 
(Table 3). Besides sputum, pharynx injection, 
cvat, and travel information, five symptoms are 
the ones contained in the latest Centers for Dis-
ease Control (CDC) H1N1 influenza case report 
form. The others are strong indicators as well. 
The previous version of the CDC form contains 
sputum in the signs and symptoms section, and 
Himmerick (2009) described that pharyngeal 
injection is a clinical sign of uncomplicated 
swine-origin influenza A. Travel information is 
another important factor to diagnose an h1n1 
case in Korea and included in a special purpose 
h1n1 clinical document format in SNUH emer-
gency department. 
We compared start time of the features but 
could not find any differences. The symptoms 
had been developed so rapidly that temporal pat-
tern comparison between two groups was not 
meaningful. All the selected symptoms were de-
veloped within three days, and moreover, the 
symptoms in twelve documents were occurred in 
one day. As our data usually describes occur-
rence time in day granularity and the sample size 
is too small, we could not compare the features 
in finer granularity. 
4 Conclusion and Discussion 
In this paper, we tried to establish a methodolog-
ical approach to extract distinctive features of a 
novel pandemic on the early symptoms expe-
rienced by the patients. We applied popular data 
mining techniques to swine flu suspected cases. 
The results correspond to outputs of previous 
specialized medical domain research. We could 
get valuable information with extremely small 
amount of data. This methodological approach 
could be used usefully in novel infectious disease 
management and research to prevent spreading 
of the pandemic at the very beginning stage.
