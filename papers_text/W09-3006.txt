Abstract
In this paper we explain how we anno-
tated subordinators in the Turkish Dis-
course Bank (TDB), an effort that started
in 2007 and is still continuing. We in-
troduce the project and describe some of
the issues that were important in anno-
tating three subordinators, namely kars??n,
rag?men and halde, all of which encode the
coherence relation Contrast-Concession.
We also describe the annotation tool.
1 Introduction
The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is a project
initiated by the joint effort of a group of re-
searchers in Turkey. The project builds on an ex-
isting corpus, namely the METU Turkish Corpus
(MTC) (Say et al, 2002), and extends it to a dis-
course level resource by following the principles
of the PDTB (Prasad et al, 2007) in annotating
discourse connectives and their arguments. The 2-
million-word MTC contains 520 continuous texts
from various genres written between 1991-2000.
From a semantic perspective, we take discourse
connectives as predicates that take as their argu-
ments tensed or untensed clauses with abstract ob-
ject interpretations. Abstract objects are proposi-
tions, facts, events, situations, etc. (Asher, 1993).
Connectives themselves may be realized explicitly
or implicitly (Halliday, 1985; Prasad et al, 2007).
Explicit connectives are simple or complex lexi-
cal items that encode a discourse relation, while
implicit connectives can be inferred from related
text spans that have coherence relations. The TDB
project aims to annotate explicit connectives only.
In Turkish, discourse connectives are identified
with three syntactic categories (Zeyrek and Web-
ber, 2008): (a) Coordinating conjunctions (b) Sub-
ordinators (c) Discourse adverbials (or anaphoric

connectives). All these discourse connectives have
two and only two arguments, which are conve-
niently labeled as ARG1 and ARG2.1 ARG2 is
always the argument that syntactically hosts the
connective.
The ARG1/ARG2 organization of discourse
connectives is consistent with the following ob-
servations in discourse: Sentences in discourse
are coherently related, and therefore when ex-
plicit discourse connectives are used, if they are
really discourse connectives, they are bound to
set up a relation between a consequent clause and
its antecedent. (Note that the ARG2 designation
does not imply that ARG2 is consequent or an-
tecedent.) In certain cases presupposition needs a
mediator, viz. the discourse connective. Noncon-
nectival discourse relations are certainly possible,
but connective-engendered discourse relations are
claimed to be more specific about their semantics,
e.g. they bring about presuppositional meaning
(van der Sandt, 1992; Webber et al, 1999).
In this regard, the ARG1/ARG2 classification is
unlike syntactic subcategorization, which is a lex-
ical property of functors (e.g. verbs) which are
not necessarily presuppositional and hence they
can differ in arbitrary ways (ditransitive, transitive,
unergative, unaccusative etc.).
2 The Data
The MTC is preprocessed to obtain the raw texts
keeping the title, author, publishing date and the
text type information at the beginning of each file.
Stand-off annotation is done on the textual render-
ing of the MTC.
To enable the data to be viewable universally
without losing any character information, the file
format (originally xcs) was converted to text, and
the character encoding (originally Turkish-ISO-
1Whether or not discourse connectives in any language
take more than two arguments is an open question that needs
to be established in further research.

processed MTC data were divided into four sub-
corpora by keeping the text type distribution, file

subcorpus. The text type distribution, file count

pus are given in Table 1. In the project, we plan to

3 Subordinating Conjunctions in
Turkish: A Brief Overview
Subordinators have two subtypes. Converbs are
suffixes attached directly to verb roots. For exam-
ple, the suffix -(y)ArAk ?by (means of)? requires
as its ARG2 a nominalized adverbial clause as in
(1). Complex subordinators, e.g. rag?men ?despite,
although?, kars??n ?although?, halde ?despite, along
with?, ic?in causal ?since?, purposive ?so as to?, etc.
mostly take case-marked nominalized clauses as
their ARG2.
(1) Hu?ku?met ... uyum paketini onaylayarak ...
Erdog?an?n o?nu?ndeki engellerden birini kald?rd?.
By approving the adaptation package ..., the
government alleviated one of the obstacles for
Erdog?an ...
In this paper, we will not deal with converbs.
We will also not deal with connectives taking as
their ARG2 a finite clause because none of these
subtypes have been annotated yet. We will focus
on three postpositions taking a nominalized clause
as ARG2, namely rag?men, kars??n and halde, all of
which encode the Contrast-Concession relation.
In the PDTB, such clauses were not annotated as
arguments. However, in Turkish, they are so com-
mon as arguments of subordinators that we would
have missed an important property of Turkish dis-
course if we did not annotate them. In the rest
of the paper, we provide examples taken from the
MTC. We underline the connective, show ARG2
in bold letters and render ARG1 in italics.
3.1 The minimality principle
As in the PDTB, the minimality principle is in-
voked, according to which clauses, parts of clauses
or sentences that are minimally necessary and suf-
ficient for the discourse relation engendered by
the connective are annotated as ARG1 or ARG2
(Prasad et al, 2007). Any other text span that
is perceived to be important for the interpretation
of the discourse relation can be selected as sup-
plementary information in addition to ARG1 or
ARG2.
3.2 Morphological properties of the
arguments and their relative ordering
In Turkish, subordinate clauses are essentially
nominalizations, which may be formed by -DIK
or -mA suffixes (the factive nominal and the action
nominal, respectively (Kornfilt, 1997)).
Two of the connectives, i.e. rag?men and kars??n
expect action nominals, the person agreement suf-
fix, and the dative suffix -(y)A on their ARG2. On
the other hand, the connective halde expects a fac-
tive nominal and the person agreement suffix. In
the examples below, we show these suffixes with
glosses on the English translations.
The arguments of subordinators are necessarily
adjacent and mostly exhibit the ARG2-ARG1 or-
der because Turkish is a left-branching language
and subordinate clauses are on the left in canonical
order. ARG2 can be postposed for backgrounding
purposes or to express new and unexpected infor-
mation, as in (2).
(2) ... ayn? annesine oldu]ugu gibi ona da, kimseye
ba/uglanmayanlar kolayca bag?lan?yordu; u?stelik o
o?yle bir bag??ml?l?k talep etmedig?i halde.
... just as it happened to her mother, people who
can?t easily commit themselves to anyone would
45
easily commit themselves to her, although she
would not ask-FACTN-AGR for such a commit-
ment.
3.3 Issues in annotating the arguments
One of the challenges we have faced so far is the
question of how to annotate connectives which are
themselves a converb suffix (e.g. -(y)ArAk, as in
(1)) or postpositions that choose a case-marked
ARG2 as in (2). In both cases, we decided to an-
notate ARG2 by selecting the clause without sepa-
rating the suffixes. In this way, we would not inter-
fere with the annotators? intuitions since we would
not be demanding them to have conscious knowl-
edge of the morphological constraints on the ar-
guments. This style of annotation was welcomed
by the annotators. When all the annotations are
completed, we plan to separate the suffixes with a
morphological parser to provide a full view of the
morphology of the arguments.
Another issue was how to annotate shared sub-
jects in subordinate clauses. Turkish allows sub-
ject pro-drop and in complex sentences, the shared
subject is shown by the person agreement suffix
on the verb of the consequent clause. To capture
this fact, we chose to exclude shared subjects from
the annotation of the arguments. This style of
annotation conforms to the minimality principle.
As illustrated in (3), the subject, Neriman, which
appears in its canonical clause-initial position in
ARG2 is not selected because the verb of the sub-
sequent clause carries the person agreement suffix.
(3) Neriman yatak odas?nda sigara ic?ilmesini is-
temedig?i halde s?imdilik sigaraya ses c??karm?yor.
Although Neriman does not want-FACTN-AGR
people to smoke in her bedroom, (she) doesn?t
say-AGR anything for the moment.2
If the subject is not shared, it is included in the
annotation, even if it causes discontinuity. As it
is illustrated in (4), ARG2 intervenes in ARG1 by
separating it from its subject.
(4) Rukiye, kendisinden u?c? yas? ufak olmas?na
rag?men, erkek kardes?ini kendi og?lu san?yordu, ...
Rukiye, although (he) is-ACTN-AGR-DAT three
years younger than herself, thought-AGR that her
brother was her son...
2The pronoun is in parentheses to reflect pro-drop. The
following abbreviations are used on the translations to show
the morphological characteristics of the clauses: ACTN: Ac-
tion nominal, FACTN: Factive nominal, AGR: Person agree-
ment suffix, DAT: Dative case, ABL: Ablative case. NOM:
Nominative case.
Example (5) shows that two nominalized
clauses can be selected as the arguments of the
subordinator kars??n leaving out the shared sub-
ject. In this example, the subject is shown between
square brackets for clarity. Note that, ARG1 is
also a nominalized clause since it is embedded un-
der the attribution verb so?yle - ?say?.3
(5) ... [herkes yarat?lan toplumsal deg?erden verdig?i
emek oran?nda pay alacak bic?imindeki sosyalist
iktisat ilkesinin] asl?nda c?ok es?itlikc?i gibi
go?zu?kmesine kars??n es?itsizlig?i engelleye-
meyeceg?ini, ... so?yler
... says that ... despite (it) looks-ACTN-AGR-
DAT quite egalitarian, [the socialist principle,
stating that everyone gets a share proportional to
his labor] will not prevent-ACTN-AGR inequality
...
Finally, in annotating adjuncts, we follow the
same principle we followed in annotating shared
subjects. For instance in (6), the adjunct yemekte
?at dinner? is not annotated since it is shared by the
arguments of the connective rag?men.
(6) Gu?l de yemekte kilo ald?rmas?na rag?men S?am
tatl?lar?ndan c?ok hos?land?g??n? ifade etti.
At dinner, Gu?l-NOM, also said that although
(theyi) are-ACTN-AGR-DAT fattening, (he)
likes Damascus deserts-ABLi very much.
4 The Annotation Process
Before the annotation procedure started, a set of
annotation guidelines were prepared. The guide-
lines include the basic principles, such as what
discourse connectives are, where in the discourse
one can find ARG1 and ARG2, how to annotate
shared subjects, adjuncts, etc. Rather than being
strict rules, the guidelines are aimed at being gen-
eral principles guiding the annotators in their de-
cision of selecting the text span that is minimally
sufficient for interpreting the discourse relation en-
coded by the connective.
The annotation cycle consisted of 1) annotat-
ing a connective by at least three different people
2) measuring the agreement among them with the
inter-anotator agreement tool 3) resolving the dis-
agreements with an anonymous decision.
4.1 The annotation tool
We have an XML-based infrastructure for annota-
tion. It aims to produce searchable and trackable
data. Stand-off annotation has well-known advan-
tages such as the ability to see layers separately, or
3In the PDTB, attribution is not taken as a discourse re-
lation but it is annotated. Attribution is not annotated in the
TDB.

The first column shows the overall agreement among the three annotators. Other columns show the agreement of one annotator

to distribute annotation without data due to licens-
ing constraints. To this list we can add the em-
pirical necessity that, the crossing links in a single
layer of same kind of annotation might not be easy
to do inline. They can be done inline using SGML
OCCURS checks, but they are easier to annotate
in stand-off mode.
The tool has a regular expression mode in which
the annotator can use his/her knowledge of Turk-
ish word structure to collect similarly inflected
words without morphological analysis. For exam-
ple, -ArAk$, in which the uppercase forms repre-
sent metaphonemes, will bring words ending with
the allomorphs of the converb suffix due to vowel
harmony: erek, arak etc.
5 Conclusion
The TDB project is a first attempt in creating an
annotated resource for written Turkish discourse.
The annotation process is still continuing. In this
paper, the emphasis was on a small number of con-
nectives, namely three postpositions, which form a
subclass of subordinators. The paper described the
role of certain morpho-syntactic facts in interpret-
ing the coherence relation between two clauses,
and how these facts were reflected in the annota-
tions.
Three subjects separately annotated each of the
subordinators on the annotation tool, and inter-
rater reliability was calculated. The statistics were
obtained from Cochran?s Q test to the ARG1 and
ARG2 spans. The annotation data were encoded
with 1 if the character is in the span and 0 if it
is not. The encoded data were put to the Q test.
All the results were above the minimum success
probability (>0.05), showing that the annotations
were consistent (see Table 2). We will run another
Cochran experiment in which we will test whether
the annotators agree on ARG1/ARG2 boundaries,
rather than just word inclusion in the text spans as
above.
Given the distribution of agreements, Cochran
provides the number of subjects who must agree
so that a text span can be reliably considered an
ARG1 or ARG2. This we believe is important to
report with the final product (to be made public
soon), so that its gold standard can be assessed by
the community.
