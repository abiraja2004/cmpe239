Abstract
In this paper, we describe SemEval-2013 Task
4: the definition, the data, the evaluation and
the results. The task is to capture some of the
meaning of English noun compounds via para-
phrasing. Given a two-word noun compound,
the participating system is asked to produce
an explicitly ranked list of its free-form para-
phrases. The list is automatically compared
and evaluated against a similarly ranked list
of paraphrases proposed by human annota-
tors, recruited and managed through Ama-
zon?s Mechanical Turk. The comparison of
raw paraphrases is sensitive to syntactic and
morphological variation. The ?gold? ranking
is based on the relative popularity of para-
phrases among annotators. To make the rank-
ing more reliable, highly similar paraphrases
are grouped, so as to downplay superficial dif-
ferences in syntax and morphology. Three
systems participated in the task. They all beat
a simple baseline on one of the two evalua-
tion measures, but not on both measures. This
shows that the task is difficult.
1 Introduction
A noun compound (NC) is a sequence of nouns
which act as a single noun (Downing, 1977), as in
these examples: colon cancer, suppressor protein,
tumor suppressor protein, colon cancer tumor sup-
pressor protein, etc. This type of compounding is
highly productive in English. NCs comprise 3.9%
and 2.6% of all tokens in the Reuters corpus and the
British National Corpus (BNC), respectively (Bald-
win and Tanaka, 2004).
The frequency spectrum of compound types fol-
lows a Zipfian distribution (O? Se?aghdha, 2008), so
many NC tokens belong to a ?long tail? of low-
frequency types. More than half of the two-noun
types in the BNC occur exactly once (Kim and Bald-
win, 2006). Their high frequency and high produc-
tivity make robust NC interpretation an important
goal for broad-coverage semantic processing of En-
glish texts. Systems which ignore NCs may give up
on salient information about the semantic relation-
ships implicit in a text. Compositional interpretation
is also the only way to achieve broad NC coverage,
because it is not feasible to list in a lexicon all com-
pounds which one is likely to encounter. Even for
relatively frequent NCs occurring 10 times or more
in the BNC, static English dictionaries provide only
27% coverage (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).
In many natural language processing applications
it is important to understand the syntax and seman-
tics of NCs. NCs often are structurally similar,
but have very different meaning. Consider caffeine
headache and ice-cream headache: a lack of caf-
feine causes the former, an excess of ice-cream ? the
latter. Different interpretations can lead to different
inferences, query expansion, paraphrases, transla-
tions, and so on. A question answering system may
have to determine whether protein acting as a tumor
suppressor is an accurate paraphrase for tumor sup-
pressor protein. An information extraction system
might need to decide whether neck vein thrombosis
and neck thrombosis can co-refer in the same doc-
ument. A machine translation system might para-
phrase the unknown compound WTO Geneva head-
quarters as WTO headquarters located in Geneva.
138
Research on the automatic interpretation of NCs
has focused mainly on common two-word NCs. The
usual task is to classify the semantic relation under-
lying a compound with either one of a small number
of predefined relation labels or a paraphrase from an
open vocabulary. Examples of the former take on
classification include (Moldovan et al, 2004; Girju,
2007; O? Se?aghdha and Copestake, 2008; Tratz and
Hovy, 2010). Examples of the latter include (Nakov,
2008b; Nakov, 2008a; Nakov and Hearst, 2008; But-
nariu and Veale, 2008) and a previous NC paraphras-
ing task at SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al, 2010),
upon which the task described here builds.
The assumption of a small inventory of prede-
fined relations has some advantages ? parsimony and
generalization ? but at the same time there are lim-
itations on expressivity and coverage. For exam-
ple, the NCs headache pills and fertility pills would
be assigned the same semantic relation (PURPOSE)
in most inventories, but their relational semantics
are quite different (Downing, 1977). Furthermore,
the definitions given by human subjects can involve
rich and specific meanings. For example, Down-
ing (1977) reports that a subject defined the NC
oil bowl as ?the bowl into which the oil in the en-
gine is drained during an oil change?, compared to
which a minimal interpretation bowl for oil seems
very reductive. In view of such arguments, linguists
such as Downing (1977), Ryder (1994) and Coulson
(2001) have argued for a fine-grained, essentially
open-ended space of interpretations.
The idea of working with fine-grained para-
phrases for NC semantics has recently grown in pop-
ularity among NLP researchers (Butnariu and Veale,
2008; Nakov and Hearst, 2008; Nakov, 2008a). Task
9 at SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al, 2010) was de-
voted to this methodology. In that previous work,
the paraphrases provided by human subjects were
required to fit a restrictive template admitting only
verbs and prepositions occurring between the NC?s
constituent nouns. Annotators recruited through
Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to provide
paraphrases for the dataset of NCs. The gold stan-
dard for each NC was the ranked list of paraphrases
given by the annotators; this reflects the idea that a
compound?s meaning can be described in different
ways, at different levels of granularity and capturing
different interpretations in the case of ambiguity.
For example, a plastic saw could be a saw made
of plastic or a saw for cutting plastic. Systems par-
ticipating in the task were given the set of attested
paraphrases for each NC, and evaluated according to
how well they could reproduce the humans? ranking.
The design of this task, SemEval-2013 Task 4,
is informed by previous work on compound anno-
tation and interpretation. It is also influenced by
similar initiatives, such as the English Lexical Sub-
stitution task at SemEval-2007 (McCarthy and Nav-
igli, 2007), and by various evaluation exercises in
the fields of paraphrasing and machine translation.
We build on SemEval-2010 Task 9, extending the
task?s flexibility in a number of ways. The restric-
tions on the form of annotators? paraphrases was re-
laxed, giving us a rich dataset of close-to-freeform
paraphrases (Section 3). Rather than ranking a set of
attested paraphrases, systems must now both gener-
ate and rank their paraphrases; the task they perform
is essentially the same as what the annotators were
asked to do. This new setup required us to innovate
in terms of evaluation measures (Section 4).
We anticipate that the dataset and task will be of
broad interest among those who study lexical se-
mantics. We believe that the overall progress in the
field will significantly benefit from a public-domain
set of free-style NC paraphrases. That is why our
primary objective is the challenging endeavour of
preparing and releasing such a dataset to the re-
search community. The common evaluation task
which we establish will also enable researchers to
compare their algorithms and their empirical results.
2 Task description
This is an English NC interpretation task, which ex-
plores the idea of interpreting the semantics of NCs
via free paraphrases. Given a noun-noun compound
such as air filter, the participating systems are asked
to produce an explicitly ranked list of free para-
phrases, as in the following example:
1 filter for air
2 filter of air
3 filter that cleans the air
4 filter which makes air healthier
5 a filter that removes impurities from the air
. . .
139
Such a list is then automatically compared and
evaluated against a similarly ranked list of para-
phrases proposed by human annotators, recruited
and managed via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. The
comparison of raw paraphrases is sensitive to syn-
tactic and morphological variation. The ranking
of paraphrases is based on their relative popular-
ity among different annotators. To make the rank-
ing more reliable, highly similar paraphrases are
grouped so as to downplay superficial differences in
syntax and morphology.
3 Data collection
We used Amazon?s Mechanical Turk service to
collect diverse paraphrases for a range of ?gold-
standard? NCs.1 We paid the workers a small fee
($0.10) per compound, for which they were asked to
provide five paraphrases. Each paraphrase should
contain the two nouns of the compound (in sin-
gular or plural inflectional forms, but not in an-
other derivational form), an intermediate non-empty
linking phrase and optional preceding or following
terms. The paraphrasing terms could have any part
of speech, so long as the resulting paraphrase was a
well-formed noun phrase headed by the NC?s head.
We gave the workers feedback during data col-
lection if they appeared to have misunderstood the
nature of the task. Once raw paraphrases had been
collected from all workers, we collated them into a
spreadsheet, and we merged identical paraphrases
in order to calculate their overall frequencies. Ill-
formed paraphrases ? those violating the syntactic
restrictions described above ? were manually re-
moved following a consensus decision-making pro-
cedure; every paraphrase was checked by at least
two task organizers. We did not require that the
paraphrases be semantically felicitous, but we per-
formed minor edits on the remaining paraphrases if
they contained obvious typos.
The remaining well-formed paraphrases were
sorted by frequency separately for each NC. The
most frequent paraphrases for a compound are as-
signed the highest rank 0, those with the next-
highest frequency are given a rank of 1, and so on.
1Since the annotation on Mechanical Turk was going slowly,
we also recruited four other annotators to do the same work,
following exactly the same instructions.
Total Min / Max / Avg
Trial/Train (174 NCs)
paraphrases 6,069 1 / 287 / 34.9
unique paraphrases 4,255 1 / 105 / 24.5
Test (181 NCs)
paraphrases 9,706 24 / 99 / 53.6
unique paraphrases 8,216 21 / 80 / 45.4
Table 1: Statistics of the trial and test datasets: the total
number of paraphrases with and without duplicates, and
the minimum / maximum / average per noun compound.
Paraphrases with a frequency of 1 ? proposed for
a given NC by only one annotator ? always occupy
the lowest rank on the list for that compound.
We used 174+181 noun-noun compounds from
the NC dataset of O? Se?aghdha (2007). The trial
dataset, which we initially released to the partici-
pants, consisted of 4,255 human paraphrases for 174
noun-noun pairs; this dataset was also the training
dataset. The test dataset comprised paraphrases for
181 noun-noun pairs. The ?gold standard? contained
9,706 paraphrases of which 8,216 were unique for
those 181 NCs. Further statistics on the datasets are
presented in Table 1.
Compared with the data collected for the
SemEval-2010 Task 9 on the interpretation of noun
compounds, the data collected for this new task have
a far greater range of variety and richness. For ex-
ample, the following (selected) paraphrases for work
area vary from parsimonious to expansive:
? area for work
? area of work
? area where work is done
? area where work is performed
? . . .
? an area cordoned off for persons responsible for
work
? an area where construction work is carried out
? an area where work is accomplished and done
? area where work is conducted
? office area assigned as a work space
? . . .

4 Scoring
Noun compounding is a generative aspect of lan-
guage, but so too is the process of NC interpretation:
human speakers typically generate a range of possi-
ble interpretations for a given compound, each em-
phasizing a different aspect of the relationship be-
tween the nouns. Our evaluation framework reflects
the belief that there is rarely a single right answer
for a given noun-noun pairing. Participating systems
are thus expected to demonstrate some generativity
of their own, and are scored not just on the accu-
racy of individual interpretations, but on the overall
breadth of their output.
For evaluation, we provided a scorer imple-
mented, for good portability, as a Java class. For
each noun compound to be evaluated, the scorer
compares a list of system-suggested paraphrases
against a ?gold-standard? reference list, compiled
and rank-ordered from the paraphrases suggested
by our human annotators. The score assigned to
each system is the mean of the system?s performance
across all test compounds. Note that the scorer re-
moves all determiners from both the reference and
the test paraphrases, so a system is neither punished
for not reproducing a determiner or rewarded for
producing the same determiners.
The scorer can match words identically or non-
identically. A match of two identical words Wgold
and Wtest earns a score of 1.0. There is a partial
score of (2 |P | / (|PWgold| + |PWtest|))2 for a
match of two words PWgold and PWtest that are
not identical but share a common prefix P , |P | > 2,
e.g., wmatch(cutting, cuts) = (6/11)2 = 0.297.
Two n-grams Ngold = [GW1, . . . , GWn] and
Ntest = [TW1, . . . , TWn] can be matched if
wmatch(GWi, TWi) > 0 for all i in 1..n. The
score assigned to the match of these two n-grams is
then
?
i wmatch(GWi, TWi). For every n-gram
Ntest = [TW1, . . . , TWn] in a system-generated
paraphrase, the scorer finds a matching n-gram
Ngold = [GW1, . . . , GWn] in the reference para-
phrase Paragold which maximizes this sum.
The overall n-gram overlap score for a reference
paraphrase Paragold and a system-generated para-
phrase Paratest is the sum of the score calculated
for all n-grams in Paratest, where n ranges from 1
to the size of Paratest.
This overall score is then normalized by dividing
by the maximum value among the n-gram overlap
score for Paragold compared with itself and the n-
gram overlap score for Paratest compared with it-
self. This normalization step produces a paraphrase
match score in the range [0.0 ? 1.0]. It punishes a
paraphrase Paratest for both over-generating (con-
taining more words than are found in Paragold)
and under-generating (containing fewer words than
are found in Paragold). In other words, Paratest
should ideally reproduce everything in Paragold,
and nothing more or less.
The reference paraphrases in the ?gold standard?
are ordered by rank; the highest rank is assigned to
the paraphrases which human judges suggested most
often. The rank of a reference paraphrase matters
because a good participating system will aim to re-
produce the top-ranked ?gold-standard? paraphrases
as produced by human judges. The scorer assigns
a multiplier of R/(R + n) to reference paraphrases
at rank n; this multiplier asymptotically approaches
0 for the higher values of n of ever lower-ranked
paraphrases. We choose a default setting of R = 8,
so that a reference paraphrase at rank 0 (the highest
rank) has a multiplier of 1, while a reference para-
phrase at rank 5 has a multiplier of 8/13 = 0.615.
When a system-generated paraphrase Paratest is
matched with a reference paraphrase Paragold, their
normalized n-gram overlap score is scaled by the
rank multiplier attaching to the rank of Paragold rel-
ative to the other reference paraphrases provided by
human judges. The scorer automatically chooses the
reference paraphrase Paragold for a test paraphrase
Paratest so as to maximize this product of normal-
ized n-gram overlap score and rank multiplier.
The overall score assigned to each system for
a specific compound is calculated in two differ-
ent ways: using isomorphic matching of suggested
paraphrases to the ?gold-standard?s? reference para-
phrases (on a one-to-one basis); and using non-
isomorphic matching of system?s paraphrases to the
?gold-standard?s? reference paraphrases (in a poten-
tially many-to-one mapping).
Isomorphic matching rewards both precision and
recall. It rewards a system for accurately reproduc-
ing the paraphrases suggested by human judges, and
for reproducing as many of these as it can, and in
much the same order.
141
In isomorphic mode, system?s paraphrases are
matched 1-to-1 with reference paraphrases on a first-
come first-matched basis, so ordering can be crucial.
Non-isomorphic matching rewards only preci-
sion. It rewards a system for accurately reproducing
the top-ranked human paraphrases in the ?gold stan-
dard?. A system will achieve a higher score in a non-
isomorphic match if it reproduces the top-ranked hu-
man paraphrases as opposed to lower-ranked human
paraphrases. The ordering of system?s paraphrases
is thus not important in non-isomorphic matching.
Each system is evaluated using the scorer in both
modes, isomorphic and non-isomorphic. Systems
which aim only for precision should score highly
on non-isomorphic match mode, but poorly in iso-
morphic match mode. Systems which aim for pre-
cision and recall will face a more substantial chal-
lenge, likely reflected in their scores.
A na??ve baseline
We decided to allow preposition-only paraphrases,
which are abundant in the paraphrases suggested
by human judges in the crowdsourcing Mechanical
Turk collection process. This abundance means that
the top-ranked paraphrase for a given compound is
often a preposition-only phrase, or one of a small
number of very popular paraphrases such as used for
or used in. It is thus straightforward to build a na??ve
baseline generator which we can expect to score
reasonably on this task, at least in non-isomorphic
matching mode. For each test compound M H,
the baseline system generates the following para-
phrases, in this precise order: H of M, H in M, H
for M, H with M, H on M, H about M, H has M, H to
M, H used for M, H used in M.
This na??ve baseline is truly unsophisticated. No
attempt is made to order paraphrases by their corpus
frequencies or by their frequencies in the training
data. The same sequence of paraphrases is generated
for each and every test compound.
5 Results
Three teams participated in the challenge, and all
their systems were supervised. The MELODI sys-
tem relied on semantic vector space model built
from the UKWAC corpus (window-based, 5 words).
It used only the features of the right-hand head noun
to train a maximum entropy classifier.
Team isomorphic non-isomorphic
SFS 23.1 17.9
IIITH 23.1 25.8
MELODI-Primary 13.0 54.8
MELODI-Contrast 13.6 53.6
Naive Baseline 13.8 40.6
Table 2: Results for the participating systems; the base-
line outputs the same paraphrases for all compounds.
The IIITH system used the probabilities of the
preposition co-occurring with a relation to identify
the class of the noun compound. To collect statis-
tics, it used Google n-grams, BNC and ANC.
The SFS system extracted templates and fillers
from the training data, which it then combined with
a four-gram language model and a MaxEnt reranker.
To find similar compounds, they used Lin?s Word-
Net similarity. They further used statistics from the
English Gigaword and the Google n-grams.
Table 2 shows the performance of the partici-
pating systems, SFS, IIITH and MELODI, and the
na??ve baseline. The baseline shows that it is rela-
tively easy to achieve a moderately good score in
non-isomorphic match mode by generating a fixed
set of paraphrases which are both common and
generic: two of the three participating systems,
SFS and IIITH, under-perform the na??ve baseline
in non-isomorphic match mode, but outperform it
in isomorphic mode. The only system to surpass
this baseline in non-isomorphic match mode is the
MELODI system; yet, it under-performs against the
same baseline in isomorphic match mode. No par-
ticipating team submitted a system which would out-
perform the na??ve baseline in both modes.
6 Conclusions
The conclusions we draw from the experience of or-
ganizing the task are mixed. Participation was rea-
sonable but not large, suggesting that NC paraphras-
ing remains a niche interest ? though we believe it
deserves more attention among the broader lexical
semantics community and hope that the availabil-
ity of our freeform paraphrase dataset will attract a
wider audience in the future.
142
We also observed a varied response from our an-
notators in terms of embracing their freedom to gen-
erate complex and rich paraphrases; there are many
possible reasons for this including laziness, time
pressure and the fact that short paraphrases are often
very appropriate paraphrases. The results obtained
by our participants were also modest, demonstrating
that compound paraphrasing is both a difficult task
and a novel one that has not yet been ?solved?.
