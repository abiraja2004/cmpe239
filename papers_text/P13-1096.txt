Abstract
During real-life interactions, people are
naturally gesturing and modulating their
voice to emphasize specific points or to
express their emotions. With the recent
growth of social websites such as YouTube,
Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are
emerging as a new source of multimodal
and natural opinions that has been left al-
most untapped by automatic opinion anal-
ysis techniques. This paper presents a
method for multimodal sentiment classi-
fication, which can identify the sentiment
expressed in utterance-level visual datas-
treams. Using a new multimodal dataset
consisting of sentiment annotated utter-
ances extracted from video reviews, we
show that multimodal sentiment analysis
can be effectively performed, and that the
joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic
modalities can lead to error rate reductions
of up to 10.5% as compared to the best
performing individual modality.
1 Introduction
Video reviews represent a growing source of con-
sumer information that gained increasing interest
from companies, researchers, and consumers. Pop-
ular web platforms such as YouTube, Amazon,
Facebook, and ExpoTV have reported a signifi-
cant increase in the number of consumer reviews
in video format over the past five years. Compared
to traditional text reviews, video reviews provide a
more natural experience as they allow the viewer to
better sense the reviewer?s emotions, beliefs, and
intentions through richer channels such as intona-
tions, facial expressions, and body language.
Much of the work to date on opinion analysis has
focused on textual data, and a number of resources
have been created including lexicons (Wiebe and
Riloff, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) or large
annotated datasets (Maas et al, 2011). Given the
accelerated growth of other media on the Web and
elsewhere, which includes massive collections of
videos (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, VideoLectures), im-
ages (e.g., Flickr, Picasa), audio clips (e.g., pod-
casts), the ability to address the identification of
opinions in the presence of diverse modalities is be-
coming increasingly important. This has motivated
researchers to start exploring multimodal clues for
the detection of sentiment and emotions in video
content (Morency et al, 2011; Wagner et al, 2011).
In this paper, we explore the addition of speech
and visual modalities to text analysis in order to
identify the sentiment expressed in video reviews.
Given the non homogeneous nature of full-video
reviews, which typically include a mixture of posi-
tive, negative, and neutral statements, we decided
to perform our experiments and analyses at the ut-
terance level. This is in line with earlier work on
text-based sentiment analysis, where it has been
observed that full-document reviews often contain
both positive and negative comments, which led to
a number of methods addressing opinion analysis
at sentence level. Our results show that relying
on the joint use of linguistic, acoustic, and visual
modalities allows us to better sense the sentiment
being expressed as compared to the use of only one
modality at a time.
Another important aspect of this paper is the in-
troduction of a new multimodal opinion database
annotated at the utterance level which is, to our
knowledge, the first of its kind. In our work, this
dataset enabled a wide range of multimodal senti-
ment analysis experiments, addressing the relative
importance of modalities and individual features.
The following section presents related work
in text-based sentiment analysis and audio-visual
emotion recognition. Section 3 describes our new
multimodal datasets with utterance-level sentiment
annotations. Section 4 presents our multimodal sen-
973
timent analysis approach, including details about
our linguistic, acoustic, and visual features. Our
experiments and results on multimodal sentiment
classification are presented in Section 5, with a
detailed discussion and analysis in Section 6.
2 Related Work
In this section we provide a brief overview of re-
lated work in text-based sentiment analysis, as well
as audio-visual emotion analysis.
2.1 Text-based Subjectivity and Sentiment
Analysis
The techniques developed so far for subjectivity
and sentiment analysis have focused primarily on
the processing of text, and consist of either rule-
based classifiers that make use of opinion lexicons,
or data-driven methods that assume the availability
of a large dataset annotated for polarity. These tools
and resources have been already used in a large
number of applications, including expressive text-
to-speech synthesis (Alm et al, 2005), tracking
sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news
(Balog et al, 2006), analysis of political debates
(Carvalho et al, 2011), question answering (Oh et
al., 2012), conversation summarization (Carenini et
al., 2008), and citation sentiment detection (Athar
and Teufel, 2012).
One of the first lexicons used in sentiment anal-
ysis is the General Inquirer (Stone, 1968). Since
then, many methods have been developed to auto-
matically identify opinion words and their polarity
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney,
2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Taboada et al, 2011), as
well as n-gram and more linguistically complex
phrases (Yang and Cardie, 2012).
For data-driven methods, one of the most widely
used datasets is the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al,
2005), which is a collection of news articles manu-
ally annotated for opinions. Other datasets are also
available, including two polarity datasets consist-
ing of movie reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004; Maas et
al., 2011), and a collection of newspaper headlines
annotated for polarity (Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2007).
While difficult problems such as cross-domain
(Blitzer et al, 2007; Li et al, 2012) or cross-
language (Mihalcea et al, 2007; Wan, 2009; Meng
et al, 2012) portability have been addressed, not
much has been done in terms of extending the ap-
plicability of sentiment analysis to other modalities,
such as speech or facial expressions.
The only exceptions that we are aware of are the
findings reported in (Somasundaran et al, 2006;
Raaijmakers et al, 2008; Mairesse et al, 2012;
Metze et al, 2009), where speech and text have
been analyzed jointly for the purpose of subjectiv-
ity or sentiment identification, without, however,
addressing other modalities such as visual cues;
and the work reported in (Morency et al, 2011;
Perez-Rosas et al, 2013), where multimodal cues
have been used for the analysis of sentiment in
product reviews, but where the analysis was done
at the much coarser level of full videos rather than
individual utterances as we do in our work.
2.2 Audio-Visual Emotion Analysis.
Also related to our work is the research done on
emotion analysis. Emotion analysis of speech sig-
nals aims to identify the emotional or physical
states of a person by analyzing his or her voice
(Ververidis and Kotropoulos, 2006). Proposed
methods for emotion recognition from speech fo-
cus both on what is being said and how is be-
ing said, and rely mainly on the analysis of the
speech signal by sampling the content at utterance
or frame level (Bitouk et al, 2010). Several re-
searchers used prosody (e.g., pitch, speaking rate,
Mel frequency coefficients) for speech-based emo-
tion recognition (Polzin and Waibel, 1996; Tato et
al., 2002; Ayadi et al, 2011).
There are also studies that analyzed the visual
cues, such as facial expressions and body move-
ments (Calder et al, 2001; Rosenblum et al, 1996;
Essa and Pentland, 1997). Facial expressions are
among the most powerful and natural means for
human beings to communicate their emotions and
intentions (Tian et al, 2001). Emotions can be
also expressed unconsciously, through subtle move-
ments of facial muscles such as smiling or eyebrow
raising, often measured and described using the
Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (Ekman et
al., 2002).
De Silva et. al. (De Silva et al, 1997) and Chen
et. al. (Chen et al, 1998) presented one of the
early works that integrate both acoustic and visual
information for emotion recognition. In addition to
work that considered individual modalities, there
is also a growing body of work concerned with
multimodal emotion analysis (Silva et al, 1997;
Sebe et al, 2006; Zhihong et al, 2009; Wollmer et
al., 2010).

More recently, two challenges have been or-
ganized focusing on the recognition of emotions
using audio and visual cues (Schuller et al,
2011a; Schuller et al, 2011b), which included sub-
challenges on audio-only, video-only, and audio-
video, and drew the participation of many teams
from around the world. Note however that most of
the previous work on audio-visual emotion analy-
sis has focused exclusively on the audio and video
modalities, and did not consider textual features, as
we do in our work.
3 MOUD: Multimodal Opinion
Utterances Dataset
For our experiments, we created a dataset of ut-
terances (named MOUD) containing product opin-
ions expressed in Spanish.1 We chose to work with
Spanish because it is a widely used language, and
it is the native language of the main author of this
paper.
We started by collecting a set of videos from
the social media web site YouTube, using several
keywords likely to lead to a product review or rec-
ommendation. Starting with the YouTube search
page, videos were found using the following key-
words: mis products favoritos (my favorite prod-
ucts), products que no recomiendo (non recom-
mended products), mis perfumes favoritos (my fa-
vorite perfumes), peliculas recomendadas (recom-
mended movies), peliculas que no recomiendo (non
recommended movies) and libros recomendados
(recommended books), libros que no recomiendo
(non recommended books). Notice that the key-
words are not targeted at a specific product type;
rather, we used a variety of product names, so that
the dataset has some degree of generality within
the broad domain of product reviews.
1Publicly available from the authors webpage.
Among all the videos returned by the YouTube
search, we selected only videos that respected the
following guidelines: the speaker should be in front
of the camera; her face should be clearly visible,
with a minimum amount of face occlusion during
the recording; there should not be any background
music or animation. The final video set includes 80
videos randomly selected from the videos retrieved
from YouTube that also met the guidelines above.
The dataset includes 15 male and 65 female speak-
ers, with their age approximately ranging from 20
to 60 years.
All the videos were first pre-processed to elimi-
nate introductory titles and advertisements. Since
the reviewers often switched topics when express-
ing their opinions, we manually selected a 30 sec-
onds opinion segment from each video to avoid
having multiple topics in a single review.
3.1 Segmentation and Transcription
All the video clips were manually processed to
transcribe the verbal statements and also to extract
the start and end time of each utterance. Since the
reviewers utter expressive sentences that are nat-
urally segmented by speech pauses, we decided
to use these pauses (>0.5seconds) to identify the
beginning and the end of each utterance. The tran-
scription and segmentation were performed using
the Transcriber software.
Each video was segmented into an average of
six utterances, resulting in a final dataset of 498
utterances. Each utterance is linked to the corre-
sponding audio and video stream, as well as its
manual transcription. The utterances have an aver-
age duration of 5 seconds, with a standard deviation
of 1.2 seconds.

3.2 Sentiment Annotation
To enable the use of this dataset for sentiment de-
tection, we performed sentiment annotations at ut-
terance level. Annotations were done using Elan,2
which is a widely used tool for the annotation of
video and audio resources. Two annotators indepen-
dently labeled each utterance as positive, negative,
or neutral. The annotation was done after seeing
the video corresponding to an utterance (along with
the corresponding audio source). The transcription
of the utterance was also made available. Thus, the
annotation process included all three modalities: vi-
sual, acoustic, and linguistic. The annotators were
allowed to watch the video segment and their cor-
responding transcription as many times as needed.
The inter-annotator agreement was measured at
88%, with a Kappa of 0.81, which represents good
agreement. All the disagreements were reconciled
through discussions.
Table 1 shows the five utterances obtained from a
video in our dataset, along with their corresponding
2http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/
sentiment annotations. As this example illustrates,
a video can contain a mix of positive, negative, and
neutral utterances. Note also that sentiment is not
always explicit in the text: for example, the last
utterance ?Honestly, it is not the smell, it is the
taste? has an implicit reference to the ?nasty taste?
expressed in the previous utterance, and thus it was
also labeled as negative by both annotators.
4 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
The main advantage that comes with the analysis of
video opinions, as compared to their textual coun-
terparts, is the availability of visual and speech cues.
In textual opinions, the only source of information
consists of words and their dependencies, which
may sometime prove insufficient to convey the ex-
act sentiment of the user. Instead, video opinions
naturally contain multiple modalities, consisting of
visual, acoustic, and linguistic datastreams. We hy-
pothesize that the simultaneous use of these three
modalities will help create a better opinion analysis
model.

4.1 Feature Extraction
This section describes the process of automatically
extracting linguistic, acoustic and visual features
from the video reviews. First, we obtain the stream
corresponding to each modality, followed by the
extraction of a representative set of features for
each modality, as described in the following sub-
sections. These features are then used as cues to
build a classifier of positive or negative sentiment.
Figure 1 illustrates this process.
4.1.1 Linguistic Features
We use a bag-of-words representation of the video
transcriptions of each utterance to derive unigram
counts, which are then used as linguistic features.
First, we build a vocabulary consisting of all the
words, including stopwords, occurring in the tran-
scriptions of the training set. We then remove
those words that have a frequency below 10 (value
determined empirically on a small development
set). The remaining words represent the unigram
features, which are then associated with a value
corresponding to the frequency of the unigram in-
side each utterance transcription. These simple
weighted unigram features have been successfully
used in the past to build sentiment classifiers on
text, and in conjunction with Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM) have been shown to lead to state-of-
the-art performance (Maas et al, 2011).
4.1.2 Acoustic Features
Acoustic features are automatically extracted from
the speech signal of each utterance. We used the
open source software OpenEAR (Schuller, 2009)
to automatically compute a set of acoustic features.
We include prosody, energy, voicing probabilities,
spectrum, and cepstral features.
? Prosody features. These include intensity,
loudness, and pitch that describe the speech
signal in terms of amplitude and frequency.
? Energy features. These features describe the
human loudness perception.
? Voice probabilities. These are probabilities
that represent an estimate of the percentage of
voiced and unvoiced energy in the speech.
? Spectral features. The spectral features are
based on the characteristics of the human ear,
which uses a nonlinear frequency unit to simu-
late the human auditory system. These fea-
tures describe the speech formants, which
model spoken content and represent speaker
characteristics.
? Cepstral features. These features emphasize
changes or periodicity in the spectrum fea-
tures measured by frequencies; we model
them using 12 Mel-frequency cepstral coeffi-
cients that are calculated based on the Fourier
transform of a speech frame.
Overall, we have a set of 28 acoustic features.
During the feature extraction, we use a frame sam-
pling of 25ms. Speaker normalization is performed
using z-standardization. The voice intensity is
thresholded to identify samples with and without
speech, with the same threshold being used for all
the experiments and all the speakers. The features
are averaged over all the frames in an utterance, to
obtain one feature vector for each utterance.
4.1.3 Facial Features
Facial expressions can provide important clues for
affect recognition, which we use to complement
the linguistic and acoustic features extracted from
the speech stream.
The most widely used system for measuring and
describing facial behaviors is the Facial Action
Coding System (FACS), which allows for the de-
scription of face muscle activities through the use
of a set of Action Units (AUs). According with
(Ekman, 1993), there are 64 AUs that involve the
upper and lower face, including several face posi-
tions and movements.3 AUs can occur either by
themselves or in combination, and can be used to
identify a variety of emotions. While AUs are fre-
quently annotated by certified human annotators,
automatic tools are also available. In our work, we
use the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox
(CERT) (Littlewort et al, 2011), which allows us to
automatically extract the following visual features:
? Smile and head pose estimates. The smile
feature is an estimate for smiles. Head pose
detection consists of three-dimensional esti-
mates of the head orientation, i.e., yaw, pitch,
and roll. These features provide information
about changes in smiles and face positions
while uttering positive and negative opinions.
? Facial AUs. These features are the raw es-
timates for 30 facial AUs related to muscle
movements for the eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips,
3http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/face/www/facs.htm
977
and chin. They provide detailed information
about facial behaviors from which we expect
to find differences between positive and nega-
tive states.
? Eight basic emotions. These are estimates
for the following emotions: anger, contempt,
disgust, fear, joy, sad, surprise, and neutral.
These features describe the presence of two or
more AUs that define a specific emotion. For
example, the unit A12 describes the pulling
of lip corners movement, which usually sug-
gests a smile but when associated with a
check raiser movement (unit A6), represents
a marker for the emotion of happiness.
We extract a total of 40 visual features, each
of them obtained at frame level. Since only one
person is present in each video clip, most of the
time facing the camera, the facial tracking was
successfully applied for most of our data. For the
analysis, we use a sampling rate of 30 frames per
second. The features extracted for each utterance
are averaged over all the valid frames, which are
automatically identified using the output of CERT.4
Segments with more than 60% of invalid frames
are simply discarded.
5 Experiments and Results
We run our sentiment classification experiments
on the MOUD dataset introduced earlier. From
the dataset, we remove utterances labeled as neu-
tral, thus keeping only the positive and negative
utterances with valid visual features. The removal
of neutral utterances is done for two main reasons.
First, the number of neutral utterances in the dataset
is rather small. Second, previous work in subjec-
tivity and sentiment analysis has demonstrated that
a layered approach (where neutral statements are
first separated from opinion statements followed
by a separation between positive and negative state-
ments) works better than a single three-way classifi-
cation. After this process, we are left with an exper-
imental dataset of 412 utterances, 182 of which are
labeled as positive, and 231 are labeled as negative.
From each utterance, we extract the linguis-
tic, acoustic, and visual features described above,
which are then combined using the early fusion
(or feature-level fusion) approach (Hall and Llinas,
4There is a small number of frames that CERT could not
process, mostly due to the brief occlusions that occur when
the speaker is showing the product she is reviewing.

1997; Atrey et al, 2010). In this approach, the fea-
tures collected from all the multimodal streams are
combined into a single feature vector, thus result-
ing in one vector for each utterance in the dataset
which is used to make a decision about the senti-
ment orientation of the utterance.
We run several comparative experiments, using
one, two, and three modalities at a time. We use
the entire set of 412 utterances and run ten fold
cross validations using an SVM classifier, as imple-
mented in the Weka toolkit.5 In line with previous
work on emotion recognition in speech (Haq and
Jackson, 2009; Anagnostopoulos and Vovoli, 2010)
where utterances are selected in a speaker depen-
dent manner (i.e., utterances from the same speaker
are included in both training and test), as well as
work on sentence-level opinion classification where
document boundaries are not considered in the split
performed between the training and test sets (Wil-
son et al, 2004; Wiegand and Klakow, 2009), the
training/test split for each fold is performed at ut-
terance level regardless of the video they belong
to.
Table 2 shows the results of the utterance-level
sentiment classification experiments. The baseline
is obtained using the ZeroR classifier, which as-
signs the most frequent label by default, averaged
over the ten folds.
6 Discussion
The experimental results show that sentiment clas-
sification can be effectively performed on multi-
modal datastreams. Moreover, the integration of

mation gain weights associated with the top most
informative acoustic-visual features.
visual, acoustic, and linguistic features can improve
significantly over the use of one modality at a time,
with incremental improvements observed for each
added modality.
Among the individual classifiers, the linguistic
classifier appears to be the most accurate, followed
by the classifier that relies on visual clues, and by
the audio classifier. Compared to the best indi-
vidual classifier, the relative error rate reduction
obtained with the tri-modal classifier is 10.5%.
The results obtained with this multimodal utter-
ance classifier are found to be significantly better
than the best individual results (obtained with the
text modality), with significance being tested with
a t-test (p=0.05).
Feature analysis.
To determine the role played by each of the vi-
sual and acoustic features, we compare the fea-
ture weights assigned by the learning algorithm,
as shown in Figure 2. Interestingly, a distressed
brow is the strongest indicator of sentiment, fol-
lowed, this time not surprisingly, by the smile fea-
ture. Other informative features for sentiment clas-
sification are the voice probability, representing the
energy in speech, the combined visual features that
represent an angry face, and two of the cepstral
coefficients.
To reach a better understanding of the relation
between features, we also calculate the Pearson
correlation between the visual and acoustic fea-
tures. Table 3 shows a subset of these correlation
figures. As we expected, correlations between fea-
tures of the same type are higher. For example,
the correlation between features AU6 and AU12
or the correlation between intensity and loudness
is higher than the correlation between AU6 and in-
tensity. Nonetheless, we still find some significant
correlations between features of different types, for
instance AU12 and AU45 which are both signifi-
cantly correlated with the intensity and loudness
features. This give us confidence about using them
for further analysis.
Video-level sentiment analysis.
To understand the role played by the size of the
video-segments considered in the sentiment classi-
fication experiments, as well as the potential effect
of a speaker-independence assumption, we also run
a set of experiments where we use full videos for
the classification.
In these experiments, once again the sentiment
annotation is done by two independent annotators,
using the same protocol as in the utterance-based
annotations. Videos that were ambivalent about
the general sentiment were either labeled as neu-
tral (and thus removed from the experiments), or
labeled with the dominant sentiment. The inter-
annotator agreement for this annotation was mea-
sured at 96.1%. As before, the linguistic, acoustic,
and visual features are averaged over the entire
video, and we use an SVM classifier in ten-fold
cross validation experiments.
Table 4 shows the results obtained in these
video-level experiments. While the combination of
modalities still helps, the improvement is smaller
than the one obtained during the utterance-level
classification. Specifically, the combined effect of
acoustic and visual features improves significantly
over the individual modalities. However, the com-
bination of linguistic features with other modalities
does not lead to clear improvements. This may be
due to the smaller number of feature vectors used
in the experiments (only 80, as compared to the
412 used in the previous setup). Another possi-
ble reason is the fact that the acoustic and visual
modalities are significantly weaker than the lin-
guistic modality, most likely due to the fact that
the feature vectors are now speaker-independent,
which makes it harder to improve over the linguis-
tic modality alone.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a multimodal approach
for utterance-level sentiment classification. We
introduced a new multimodal dataset consisting

Our experiments show that sentiment annotation
of utterance-level visual datastreams can be ef-
fectively performed, and that the use of multiple
modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to
10.5% as compared to the use of one modality at a
time. In future work, we plan to explore alternative
multimodal fusion methods, such as decision-level
and meta-level fusion, to improve the integration
of the visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities.
