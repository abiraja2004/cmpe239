Abstract 
We present a bootstrapping approach to infer 
new proteins, locations and protein-location 
pairs by combining UniProt seed protein-
location pairs with dependency paths from a 
large collection of text. Of the top 20 system 
proposed protein-location pairs, 18 were in 
UniProt or supported by online evidence. In-
terestingly, 3 of the top 20 locations identified 
by the system were in the UniProt description, 
but missing from the formal ontology.  
1 Introduction 
Identifying subcellular protein locations is an im-
portant problem because the protein location can 
shed light on the protein function. Our goal is to 
identify new proteins, new locations and new pro-
tein-location relationships directly from full-text 
scientific articles. As with many ontological rela-
tions, location relations can be described as a bina-
ry predicate comprising two arguments, 
Location(X, Y) indicates that X is located in Y, 
such as Location (CIC-5, luminal membrane) from 
the sentence: ClC-5 specific signal also appeared 
to be localized close to the luminal membrane of 
the intestinal crypt. 
Identifying protein subcellular locations has 
been framed as a classification task, where features 
include sequences, motifs and amino acid compo-
sition (H?glund, et al 2006) and protein networks 
(Lee et al, 2008). The SherLoc system (Shatkay et 
al., 2007) includes text features the EpiLoc system 
(Brady & Shatkay, 2008) represents text from 
Medline abstracts as a vector of terms and uses a 
support vector machine to predict the most likely 
location for a new protein. Classification accuracy 
varies between species, locations, and datasets.  
We take an alternative strategy in this paper and 
propose a bootstrapping algorithm similar to 
(Gildea & Jurafsky, 2001). The proposed system 
builds on earlier work (Zheng & Blake, 2010) by 
considering a larger set of seed terms and by re-
moving syntactic path constraints. 
2 Approach 
The proposed bootstrapping algorithm is depicted 
in Figure 1. The system identifies lexico-syntactic 
patterns from sentences that include a given set of 
seed terms. Those the patterns are then used to in-
fer new proteins, new locations, and new protein-
location relationships. The system thus requires (a) 
an existing collection of known entity pairs that 
participate in a location relationship (called the 
seed terms) (b) a corpora of texts that report loca-
tion relationships and (c) a syntactic path represen-
tation.  
Our experiments use seed protein-location rela-
tionships from the UniProt knowledge base 
(www.uniprot.org). The complete knowledge base 
comprises more than 80,000 protein names for a 
range of species. The system uses the location and 
the location synonyms from the UniProt controlled 
vocabulary of subcellular locations and membrane 
topologies and orientations (www.uniprot.org/ 
docs/subcell release 2011_2). The system also used 
a list of protein terms that were created by identify-
ing words that immediately precede the word pro-
tein or proteins in the TREC collection. Two-thirds 
of the top 100 proteins in the TREC collection 
were used as seed terms and the remaining 1/3 
were used to evaluate system performance. 
The system was developed and evaluated using 
different subsets of the Genomics Text Retrieval 
(TREC) collection (Hersh, & Voorhees, 2009). 
Specifically 5533 articles in JBC 2002 were used 
for development and ~11,000 articles in JBC 2004 
and 2005 were used in the evaluation. 
The syntactic paths used the dependency tree 
representation produced by the Stanford Parser 
(Klein & Manning., 2003) (version 1.6.4).

3 Results 
The system identified 792 new proteins in the first 
iteration. All but 3 of the most frequent 20 proteins 
were in UniProt. All proteins in the test set were 
identified, but only 10 were in the top 100 proteins.  
The system identified just over 1,200 new pro-
tein-location pairs after the first bootstrapping step. 
We evaluated the twenty most frequent pairs. Two 
erroneous proteins in the previous step caused two 
protein-location pair errors. UniProt reported 13 of 
the remaining 18 protein-location pairs. The five 
remaining pairs, were supported by online sources 
and in sentences within the collection. 
The system identified 493 new locations after 
the second bootstrapping step and we evaluated the 
top 20. Sentences in the collection suggest that 9 of 
the new locations are in fact locations, but that they 
may not be subcellular locations and that 8 pro-
posed locations are too general. Interestingly, 3 of 
the top 20 locations identified by the system are 
mentioned in the UniProt definitions, but are not 
included in the control vocabulary as a synonym, 
which suggests the need for automated approaches 
such as this to supplement  manual efforts.
