ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we describe a method of extracting 
information from an on-line resource for the 
consmaction of lexical entries for a multi-lingual, 
interlingual MT system (ULTRA). We have 
been able to automatically generate lexical 
entries for interlingual concepts corresponding to
nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Although 
several features of these entries continue to be 
supplied manually we have greatly decreased the 
time required to generate ach entry and see this 
as a promising method for the creation of large- 
scale lexicons. 
1. Introduction 
For some time, researchers in Computa- 
tional Linguistics and Natural Language Process- 
ing (NLP) have eyed machine-readable dic- 
tionaries with interest because they might pro- 
vide a practical resource for overcoming the 
"lexical acquisition bottleneck". Many research- 
ers, however, view this problem of lexical 
acquisition as too difficult to solve at present 
using a machine-readable dictionary, and the 
result has been that the focus of much research 
has shifted to identifying the kind of information 
needed in NLP lexicons \[Atkins, 1990; Miike, 
1990; McNaught, 1990; Normier & Nossin, 
1990; Nirenburg et al, 1990; Hanks, 1991; 
Pustejovsky & Bergler, 1990; Warwick, 1990; 
Kay, 1989\], the goat being eventually to create a 
lexical data base that will allow the creation of a 
lexicon to be used for processing natural 
language. While we agree that it is unlikely that 
the information in machine-readable dictionaries 
is sufficient for this grand data base of facts that 
will support NLP as a whole, we are optimistic 
about making use of the information they do 
provide to support he creation of lexical enU'ies 
for specific natural language processing systems. 
In this paper, we present initial results which are 
specifically related to extracting information 
automatically from entries in the Longman Dic- 
tionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), in 
order to construct lexical entries for the ULTRA 
multilingual machine translation system. 
We give an overview ofthe ULTRA 
Machine Translation System and its lexicon 
(focusing on the information requirements of its 
lexical entries), and then discuss the lexical entry 
construction process. Finally, we offer some 
suggestions for fully automating the entire pro- 
c~ss. 
2. ULTRA 
ULTRA (Universal Language TRAnslator) 
is a multilingual, interlingual machine transla- 
tion system which currently translates between 
five languages (Chinese, English, German, 
Japanese, Spanish) with vocabularies in each 
language based on about 10,000 word senses. It 
makes use of recent AI, linguistic and logic pro- 
gramming techniques, and the system's major 
design criteria are that it be robust and general in 
purpose, with simple-to-use utilities for customi- 
zation. 
Its special features include: 
a multilinguat system with a language- 
independent system of intermediate 
representations (interlingual representa- 
tions) for representing expressions as ele- 
ments of linguistic acts;

- bidirectional Prolog grammars for each 
language incorporating semantic and prag- 
matic constraints; 
use of relaxation techniques to provide 
robustness by giving preferable or "near 
miss" translations; 
access to large machine-readable dic- 
tionaries to give rapid scaling up of size 
and coverage; 
? multilingual text editing within X-windows 
interface for easy interaction and document 
preparation i  specific domains (e.g., busi- 
ness letters, pro-forlna memoranda, telexes, 
parts orders). 
Below is a sample screen from the ULTRA 
system. Each of the Spanish sentences in the 
"SOURCE TEXT" window have been translatexl 
into Japanese. The system has ~cut and paste" 
facilities which allow a sentence from tim source 
text to be moved to the bottom left "SOURCE 
SENT:" window where it can then be translated 
by selecting a target language from the choices 
above the "TRANSLATION" window (bottom 
right) and choosing the "TRANSLATE" button 
at the bottom of the screen. The translation then 
appears in the bottom right "TRANSLATION" 
window. From there, the translation can then be 
moved to the "TARGET TEXT' window.

The System of Intermediate Representation 
The interlingual representation (IR) has 
been designed to reflect our assumption that 
what is universal about language is that it is 
used to perform acts of communication: asking 
questions, describing the world, expressing one's 
thoughts, getting people to do things, warmng 
them not to do things, promising that things will 
get done and so on. Translation, then, can be 
viewed as the use of the taaget language to per- 
form the same act as that which was performed 
using the source language. The IR serves as the 
basis for analyzing or for generating expressions 
as elements of such acts in each of the languages 
in the translation system. 
The representation has been formulated oil 
the basis of an on-going cross-linguistic com- 
parative analysis of hand-generated translations 
with respect o the kinds of information eces- 
sary for selecting the appropriate forms of 
equivalent expressions in the different languages 
in the system. We have looked at a number of 
different types of communication including 
expository texts, business letters, and e-mail 
messages and dialogues. This, coupled with the 
fact that the languages elected for the initial 
development s age are of differem historical and 
typological background, has led to a solid foun- 
dation for developing a flexible and complete 
descriptive framework. 
The Language Components 
Each individual language system is 
independent of all other language systems within 
ULTRA. Corresponding sentences in different 
languages must produce the same IR and any 
specific 1R must generate corresponding sen- 
tences in the five languages. However, the par- 
ticular approach to parsing or generation which 
is used m each of the languages may differ. 
Each language has its own procedures for associ- 
ating the expressions of the language with the 
appropriate IRs. These independent systems 
communicate by handing each other IRs, and no 
actual transfer takes place. 
Independence of the language-particular 
systems is of both theoretical mid practical 
interest. Given the required equivalence of the 
input-output behavior of each of the language 
systems, this paradigm is excellent for compar- 
ing various approaches to parsing or generation 
for their coverage aim efficacy. 
A new language may be added to the trans- 
lation system at any time without unpredictable 
or negative side effects on the previously 
developed language systems, or on the system's 
overall performance. 
Furthermore, the addition of any new 
language system will have the effect of multiply- 
ing the number of language pairs in the transla- 
tion system by the number of languages already 
in the system (having developed an English- 
Japanese system, we need only develop the 
Spanish module to have an English-Spanish ys- 
tem and a Japanese-Spanish ystem, and so 
forth). 
At present, we have developed five proto- 
type language systems for ULTRA. Each sys- 
tem has been implemented in PROLOG as a 
bidirectional parser/generator. That is to say, in 
a given language system, the same algorithm is 
used to do either the analysis or the generation 
of the expressions of the language. 
The system is capable of handling a wide 
range of phenomena, including compound and 
complex sentences, relative clauses, complex 
noun phrases, questions (yes-no and Wh types) 
and imperatives. ~lllere will always be certain 
classes of non-standard input (e.g. "Where sta- 
tion?") which fall outside the system's normal 
capabilities and to deal with such irregular input, 
we are developing a number of techniques which 
together we call "relaxation". Our assumption 
is that if a given stying or IR cannot be success- 
fully processed even though all the lexical items 
are available in the system, it should be repro- 
cessed with the various constraints ystemati- 
cally weakened. 
ULTRA 'S Lexicons 
There are two types of entries related to 
the specification of a lexical item in the ULTRA 
system: those for intermediate representation 
(IR) word sense tokens, and those for the words 
of the individual languages. 
Currently, there are eight IR word sense 
categories including entities (often correspond- 
ing to nouns), relations (often corresponding to
verbs and adjectives), entity specifiers (often 
corresponding to determiners), relation specifiers 
(often corresponding to auxiliaries), case rela- 
tions (often corresponding to prepositions), pro- 
AcrEs DE COLING-92. NAN'rl;s. 23-28 Ao~r 1992 S 3 4 PRoc. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
position specifiers (often corresponding to com- 
plementizers), proposition modifiers (often 
corresponding to sentential adverbials), and con- 
junctions. Each category is associateA with a 
special set of constraints which ranges in 
number fiom one for sentential adverbs, to nine 
for relations. The number of lexical categories 
for the individual language lexicons varies from 
eight to fourteen. There is no simple correspon- 
dence between the language-particular lexieai 
categories and the IR categories although the 
gross relationships stated above appear to hold. 
All entries take the general form of simple 
Prolog unit clauses in (12): 
(12) category (Form, F1, F2, ...). 
where FI, F2 and so on, are constraints. For 
language-particular entries, these arc gener',dly 
syntactic constraints associated with an ortho- 
graphic form, Form, such as the gender of a 
noun, whether a verb is reflexive, and so on. 
For example, (13) is a simplified and readable 
version of a Spanish enlxy for the noun banco. 
113) noun (banco, thirdsingular, masculine, 
bank4_ 1 ). 
Similarly, (14) is a Spanish entry for the verb 
ingreso: 
(14) verb (ingreso, thirdsingular, finite, past, 
simple, indicative, active, depositl 3). 
The final argument represents he IR word sense 
the Spanish form is used to express. This sense 
token is associated with a sense definition in 
LDOCE and is used to index the corresponding 
IR entry. 
For IR entries, tbe features FI, F2, and so 
on, correspond to universal semantic and prag- 
matic constraints on the word sense, Form, such 
as the classification of an entity as countable or 
not, the semantic ase structure of a relation, and 
so on. For example the IR entry for bank4 1 
would look something like: 
(15) entity (bank4_l, class, countable, institu- 
tion, abstract_object, economicsbanking). 
while the IR entxy for depositl 3 would look 
like: 
(16) relation (depositl_3, dynamic, placing, 
agent, patient, human, amount, human, 
abstract _object, economies_banking). 
3. The Automatic Construction of Lexieal 
Items 
The work on automating lexieal entry has 
drawn upon extensive research at the Computing 
Research Laboratory in deriving semantic strue- 
threes automatic',dly fiom large machine-readable 
dictionaries \[Slator, 1988; Wilks & Slator, 1989; 
Guthfie eL al 1990\]. Much of the core IR lexi- 
con has been deiived fi'om the 72,000 word 
senses in LDOCE. Codings fi'om the dictionary 
for such properties as semantic ategory, seman- 
tic preferences and so on have been used, either 
directly o~ indirectly, to generate partial 
specifications of some 10,000 IR tokens for the 
system. 
The partially antomated lexical entry pro- 
eess proceeds in three steps: 1) given a sense in 
LDOCE, an entry is constructed by a process of 
automatic extraction and formatting of intorma- 
tion in the foml of a standardized ata structure, 
2) any remaining unspecified information in that 
structure is provided interactively, followed by 
3) the automatic mapping from the fuUy 
specified data structure to the corresponding Pro- 
log facts. Step 3) is very straightfolward and 
will not be de,scribed here. Below we give a 
short description of LDOCE and then discuss the 
techniques we have used to accomplish steps 1) 
and 2). 
LDOCE 
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary 
English \[Procter et al, 1978\] is a filll-sized dic- 
tionary designed for learners of English as a 
second language. It contains 41,122 headword 
enwies, defined in terms of 72,177 word senses, 
m machine-readable form (a type-setting tape). 
With few exceptions, the definitions in LDOCE 
are stated using a control vocabulary of approxi- 
mately 2,(X)0 words. The eonn'ol vocabulary 
words tend to bc highly ambiguous (approxi- 
mately 17,000 senses are listed in LDOCE for 
tile 2,1X~.) s?clling forms). 
Both tile book and tape versions of 
LDOCE use a system of grammatteal codes of 
about 1111 syntactic (sub)categories which vary 
in generality. Nouns, for example, may be 
assigned categories nch as noun, or counl-nolln 
or count-noun-followed-by-infinitive-with-TO, or 
vocative-noun-used-in-direct-address. The syn- 
tactic categories for verbs are particularly exten- 
Acres Dr COLING.92, NANa'~, 23-28 AOOT 1992 5 3 5 P~oc:. ol: COLING-92, Nhbrrt!s, At~6.23-28, 1992 
sire and include categories uch as transitive- 
verb-followed-by-the-infinitive-without-TO. 
In addition, the machine-readable v rsion 
of LDOCE contains codes which are not found 
in the book and among them are codes which 
specify the semantic lass of a noun (as one of 
34 categories) and the semantic preferences on 
the complements of verbs and adjectives. 
From LDOCE to a Partially Specified Entry 
The mapping process from LDOCE to 
ULTRA word sense entries assumes a particular 
linguistic context. All the information contained 
in the LDOCE defimtion is automatically 
extracted and used in the appropriate ULTRA 
specification. For some parts of speech (e.g., 
nouns), most of the information stored in the 
interlingual entry can be ex~acted automatically; 
for others (e.g., verbs and adjectives), only a 
portion of the information isavailable. 
For this project we began with a Lisp ver- 
sion of LDOCE, which formats the information 
from the type-setting tape \[Boguraev et at., 
1987\]. To date, we have extracted information 
from LDOCE nouns for specifying IR entries for 
entities, from verbs and adjectives for specifying 
IR entries for relations, and from adverbs for 
specifying IR entries for relation modifiers and 
proposition modifiers. These are the major open 
class categories of IR word sense tokens and 
constitute over 95% of the tokens defined thus 
far. Below we summarize the information 
required by the categories corresponding to 
nouns and to verbs (the information which is 
currently provided automatically is marked by 
@). 
Entities: 
@ the sense token indexes a corresponding 
I.DOCE word sense definition, 
@ whether it is a class term, the name of an 
individual, or an anaphoric element, 
@ whether it is countable or not, 
? the semantic lass, 
@ the LDOCE semantic class, 
@ the LDOCE subject domain; 
Below is a sample screen of the interactive ses- 
sion for completing the IR lexical entry for one 
sense of "bank" in LDOCE. The first screen is 
created automatically and completed manually to 
produce the see?rid screen~

Note that for entities (nouns) only one feature, 
described above as "the semantic lass," is not 
provided automatically from LDOCE. This field 
corresponds to the semantic ategories used in 
ULTRA prior to the use of LDOCE for 
automatic extraction. These categories were 
hand crafted, based on surface lingnistic 
phenomena and are used to satisfy the semantic 
preferences of adjectives and verbs. The 
automatically created entries tot entities contain 
the LDOCE semantic categories as well, but 
these will not be used by ULTRA until we have 
examined the consistency of the LDOCE 
categories as a basis for semantic preferences. 
Relations: 
@ the sense token indexes a corresponding 
LDOCE word sense definition, 
? whether it is stative or dynamic, 
? the semantic class, 
@ the number of case roles, 
? the case roles, 
? the semantic preferences for the fillers of 
the case roles, 
@ the LDOCE semantic preferences for the 
fillers of the case roles, 
@ the LDOCE subject domain; 
In the case of relations, LDOCE does not pro- 
vide case roles or semantic lasses (for verbs), or 
a direct marking as to whether a verb is stative 
or dynamic. We have developed a verb hierar- 
chy from LDOCE, based on the genus (hyper- 
nym) of a verb definition, and are in the process 
of disambiguating the terms in this hierarchy. 
These then will be used as the verb classes for 
ULTRA's relations. We have been able to 
extract case role information in some cases 
\[Wilks et al; 90\] from implicit information in 
Longman's and will include this in the lexical 
entxies. Again the semantic preferences for the 
fillers of the case roles are those originally used 
in ULTRA. As in the case of entities above, the 
LDOCE semantic preferences are also included 
in the entry for future use. 
Extraction is performed by applying a 
sequence of flex programs (a new generation 
version of the UNIX lexical analyzer utility, lex) 
which transform information from the LDOCE 
Lisp format into a Lisp association list, the data 
structure used by the interactive lcxical entry 
interface for the ULTRA system (sample screens 
appear in the previous ecton). 
The word senses added to file ULTRA sys- 
tem using these techniques were chosen first on 
the basis of whether they were exemplified in 
the dictiona~ 3, entry, and second, whether they 
were one of the first three senses of a given 
homonym (the LDOCE senses are listed in order 
of frequency of use). Files containing the 
definitions of all noun. verb, adverb and adjec- 
tive senses for which there were example sen- 
tences were first automatically generated. An 
additional file containing example sentences 
tagged by the word sense being exemplified was 
also created. Next, association lists conespond- 
ing to IR entries fur each of the word senses 
were generated. Finally, another procedure was 
applied which automatically supplied a pointer 
to the example context in the example sentence 
file. 
4. Approaches to Achieving Full Specilication 
It was clear at the outset of this project hat 
a great deal of lexical acqttisition could be done 
automatically and we have initiated projects to 
investigate whether the missing information can 
be identified automatically through further 
analysis of the defintions, examples, gramatic'dl 
categories, etc. 
Finally, in order to automate the construc- 
tion of lexical items fully on the fly during trans- 
lation, procedures must be defined to select 
specific senses on the basis of the source 
language linguistic context of the item being 
defined. Similarly, procedures must be 
developed to automatically ,specify the different 
language-pazlicular lexical entries (these pro- 
cedures do exist in English to a limited extent), 
and these must be adapted to other langnages. 
Finally, tecbniques for using bilingual dic- 
tionaries in the language-specific lexical 
specification process must be developed.
