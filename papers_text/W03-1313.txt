Abstract
It is well known that standardising the
annotation of language resources signifi-
cantly raises their potential, as it enables
re-use and spurs the development of com-
mon technologies. Despite the fact that
increasingly complex linguistic informa-
tion is being added to biomedical texts,
no standard solutions have so far been
proposed for their encoding. This pa-
per describes a standardised XML tagset
(DTD) for annotated biomedical corpora
and other resources, which is based on
the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines
P4, a general and parameterisable stan-
dard for encoding language resources. We
ground the discussion in the encoding of
the GENIA corpus, which currently con-
tains 2,000 abstracts taken from the MED-
LINE database, and has almost 100,000
hand-annotated terms marked for seman-
tic class from the accompanying ontol-
ogy. The paper introduces GENIA and
TEI and implements a TEI parametrisa-
tion and conversion for the GENIA cor-
pus. A number of aspects of biomedi-
cal language are discussed, such as com-
plex tokenisation, prevalence of contrac-
tions and complex terms, and the linkage
and encoding of ontologies.
1 Introduction
With the growing research on processing texts from
the biomedical domain, the number of resources,
esp. corpora, is increasing rapidly. Such corpora can
be heavily annotated, e.g., with meta-data, words
and part-of-speech tags, named entities, phrases,
terms, concepts, translation equivalents, etc. Cor-
pora are invaluable to the further development of
technologies for utilising the information in biomed-
ical texts, as they provide them with training and
testing data. Given the value of such resources, it
is important to ensure their reusability and increase
their interchange potential ? a step in this direc-
tion is developing common encodings for biomedi-
cal corpora.
Standardisation of resource encoding practices
has now, for some time, been in the forefront of at-
tention. Most of these advances are Web-driven, and
include XML and related recommendations, such as
XSLT, XML Schemas, XPointer, SAX, etc. The
higher level standards, of meta-data (RDF) and on-
tologies (OWL) have been especially influential in
encoding biomedical resources. However, there re-
mains the question how to best encode the structure
of the text themselves, how to mark-up added lin-
guistic analyses, and how to implement linkages be-
tween the text and and further resources, such as lex-
ica, thesauri and ontologies. As discussed in (Ide
and Brew, 2000), in order to qualify as a ?good?
annotated corpus, its encoding should provide for
reusabilty and extensibily.
In this paper we build on previous work (Erjavec
et al, 2003) and show how to develop a standard-
ised encoding for biomedical corpora. We base
our discussion on the case of the GENIA corpus
(Ohta et al, 2002), which is originaly encoded in
GPML, the GENIA Project Markup Language, an
XML DTD. We re-encode the corpus into a stan-
dardised annotation scheme, based on the Text En-
coding Initiative Guidelines P4 (Sperberg-McQueen
and Burnard, 2002), and specify a constructive map-
ping from the original DTD to the developed encod-
ing via a XSLT transformation.
One of the motivations for such an re-encoding
is that TEI is well-designed and widely accepted ar-
chitecture, which has been often used for annotating
language corpora, and by porting to it, GENIA, and
other projects, can gain new insights into possible
encoding practices and maybe make the corpus bet-
ter suited for interchange. As the transformation to
TEI is fully automatic, there is also no need to aban-
don the original markup format (in this case GPML),
which, as it has been crafted specially for the corpus,
provides a tighter encoding than can be possible with
the more general TEI.
The paper thus proposes the creation of a prac-
tical annotation scheme for linguistically annotated
(biomedical) corpora, the conversion to which is
automatic and supports consistency checking and
validation. The paper also serves as a guide to
parametrising TEI and draws attention to certain as-
pects of biomedical corpora which are likely to face
all that wish to process such texts.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 in-
troduces the GENIA corpus; Section 3 introduces
the TEI, gives some pros and cons of using it,
and the method of parametrising TEI for particular
projects; Section 4 discusses such a parametrisation
for biomedical corpora and explains the conversion
of the GENIA corpus to TEI; Section 5 discusses
some challenging properties of biomedical text an-
notations; finally, Section 6 offers some conclusions
and directions for further work.
2 The GENIA Corpus
The GENIA corpus (Ohta et al, 2002) is be-
ing developed in the scope of the GENIA project,
which seeks to develop information extraction tech-
niques for scientific texts using NLP technol-
ogy. The corpus consists of semantically anno-
tated published abstracts from the biomedical do-
main. The corpus is a collection of articles ex-
tracted from the on-line MEDLINE abstracts (U.S.
National Center for Biotechnology Information,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, PubMed database).
Since the focus of the corpus is on biological re-
actions concerning transcription factors in human
blood cells, articles were selected that contain the
MeSH terms human, blood cell and transcription
factor.
As usual for the field, the articles are composed
largely of structurally very complex technical terms,
and are almost incomprehensible to a layperson. A
typical heading e.g., reads IL-2 gene expression and
NF-kappa B activation through CD28 requires reac-
tive oxygen production by 5-lipoxygenase.
The main value of the GENIA corpus comes from
its annotation: all the abstracts and their titles have
been marked-up by two domain experts for bio-
logically meaningful terms, and these terms have
been semantically annotated with descriptors from
the GENIA ontology.
The GENIA ontology is a taxonomy of, currently,
47 biologically relevant nominal categories, such as
body part, virus, or RNA domain or region; the tax-
onomy has 35 terminal categories.
The terms of the corpus are semantically de-
fined as those sentence constituents that can be cate-
gorised using the terminal categories from the ontol-
ogy. Syntactically such constituents are quite varied:
they include qualifiers and can be recursive.
The GENIA corpus is encoded in the Genia
Project Markup Language. The GPML is an XML
DTD (Kim et al, 2001) where each article con-
tains its MEDLINE ID, title and abstract. The texts
of the abstracts are segmented into sentences, and
these contain the constituents with their semantic
classification. The GENIA ontology is provided to-
gether with the GENIA corpus and is encoded in
DAML+OIL (http://www.daml.org/ ), the standard
XML-based ontology description language. This
structure and its annotation will be further discussed
below.
A suite of supporting tools has been developed or
tuned for the GENIA corpus and GPML: the term
annotation is performed with the XMLMind editor;
an XPath-based concordancer has been developed
for searching the corpus; and CSS stylesheets are
available for browsing it.
At the time of writing, the latest version of the
GENIA corpus is 3.01, which has been released
in April 2003. It consists of 2,000 abstracts with
over 400,000 words and more than 90,000 marked-
up terms. This version has not yet been marked-
up with tokens or PoS information, although an
earlier version (Genia-V3.0p) has been. The GE-
NIA corpus is available free of charge from the GE-
NIA project homepage, at http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-
tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/.
3 The Text Encoding Initiative
The Text Encoding Initiative was established in
1987 as a systematised attempt to develop a fully
general text encoding model and set of encoding
conventions based upon it, suitable for processing
and analysis of any type of text, in any language,
and intended to serve the increasing range of ex-
isting (and potential) applications and uses. The
TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange were first published in April 1994 in
two substantial green volumes, known as TEI P3.
In May 1999, a revised edition of TEI P3 was
produced, correcting several typographic and other
errors. In December 2000 the TEI Consortium
(http://www.tei-c.org/ ) was set up to maintain and
develop the TEI standard. In 2002, the Consortium
announced the availability of a major revision of TEI
P3, the TEI P4 (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard,
2002) the object of which is to provide equal sup-
port for XML and SGML applications using the TEI
scheme. The revisions needed to make TEI P4 have
been deliberately restricted to error correction only,
with a view to ensuring that documents conforming
to TEI P3 will not become illegal when processed
with TEI P4. For GENIA, we are using the XML-
compatible version of TEI P4.
In producing P4, many possibilities for other,
more fundamental changes have been identified.
With the establishment of the TEI Council, it be-
came possible to agree on a programme of work to
enhance and modify the Guidelines more fundamen-
tally over the coming years. TEI P5 will be the next
full revision of the Guidelines. The work on P5 has
started, and the date of its appearance will likely be
in 2004 and there are currently several TEI Working
Groups addressing various parts of the Guidelines
that need attention.
More than 80 projects spanning over 30 languages
have so far made use of the TEI guidelines, pro-
ducing diverse resources, e.g., text-critical editions
of classical works. TEI has also been influential
in corpus encoding, where the best known exam-
ple is probably the British National Corpus. How-
ever, while the TEI has been extensively used for
annotating PoS tagged corpora, it been less popu-
lar for encoding texts used by the the Information
Retrieval/Extraction community; here, a number of
other initiatives have taken the lead in encoding, say,
ontologies or inter-document linking.
3.1 Pros and cons of using TEI
Why, if a corpus is already encoded in XML using
a home-grown DTD, to re-encoded it in TEI at all?
One reasons is certainly the validation aspect of the
exercise: re-coding a corpus, or any other resource,
reveals hidden (and in practice incorrect) assump-
tions about its structure. Re-coding to a standard
recommendation also forces the corpus designers to
face issues which might have been overlooked in the
original design.
There are also other advantages of using TEI as
the interchange format: (1) it is a wide-coverage,
well-designed (modular and extensible), widely ac-
cepted and well-maintained architecture; (2) it pro-
vides extensive documentation, which comprises not
only the Guidelines but also papers and documen-
tation (best practices) of various projects; (3) it of-
fers community support via the tei-l public discus-
sion list; (4) various TEI-dedicated software already
exists, and more is likely to become available; and
(5) using it contributes to the adoption of open stan-
dards and recommendations.
However, using a very general recommendation
which tries to cater for any possible situation brings
with it also several disadvantages:
Tag abuse TEI might not have elements / attributes
with the exact meaning we require. This re-
sults in a tendency to misuse tags for purposes
they were not meant for; however, it is a case
of individual judgement to decide whether to
(slightly) abuse a tag, or to implement a lo-
cal extension to add the attribute or element re-
quired.
Tag bloat Being a general purpose recommenda-
tion, TEI can ? almost by definition ? never
be optimal for a specific application. Thus a
custom developed DTD will be leaner, have
less (redundant) tags and simpler content mod-
els.
TEI for humanities While the Guidelines cover a
vast range of text types and annotations, they
are maybe the least developed for ?high level?
NLP applications or have failed to keep abreast
of ?cutting-edge? initiatives. As will be seen,
critical areas are the encoding of ontologies, of
lexical databases and of feature structures.
3.2 Building the TEI DTD
The TEI Guidelines (Sperberg-McQueen and
Burnard, 2002) consist of the formal part, which
is a set of SGML/XML DTD fragments, and the
documentation, which explains the rationale behind
the elements available in these fragments, as well as
giving overall information about the structure of the
TEI.
The formal SGML/XML part of TEI comes as a
set of DTD fragments or tagsets. A TEI DTD for a
particular application is then constructed by select-
ing an appropriate combination of such tagsets. TEI
distinguishes the following types of tagsets:
Core tagset : standard components of the TEI main
DTD in all its forms; these are always included
without any special action by the encoder.
Base tagsets : basic building blocks for specific text
types; exactly one base must be selected by the
encoder, unless one of the combined bases is
used.
Additional tagsets : extra tags useful for particular
purposes. All additional tagsets are compatible
with all bases and with each other; an encoder
may therefore add them to the selected base in
any combination desired.
User defined tagsets : these extra tags give the pos-
sibility of extending and overriding the defi-
nitions provided in the TEI tagset. Further-
more, they give the option of explicitly includ-

tional tagsets.
While a project-particular XML DTD can be con-
structed by including and ignoring the TEI DTD
fragments directly (as exemplified in Figure 1), it is
also possible to build ? for easier processing ? a
one-file DTD with the help of the on-line TEI Pizza
Chef service, available from the TEI web site.
4 Parametrising TEI for biomedical
corpora
In previous work (Erjavec et al, 2003) we have al-
ready proposed a TEI parametrisation of GENIA
which was quite broad in its scope. Because a num-
ber of tagsets could prove useful in the long term
this parametrisation collected not only those that we
considered necessary for the current version of GE-
NIA, but also some that might prove of service in the
future. Furthermore, we supported the encoding of
both version 2.1 and 3.0 of the corpus. The resulting
DTD was thus very generous in what kinds of data it
caters for. To focus the discussion we, in the current
paper, only address tagset that are immediately rele-
vant to annotating biomedical texts. In Figure 1 we
define the XML DTD that can be used for encoding
biomedical resources, and that we used for GENIA
V3.01. The XML prolog given in this Figure defines
that ?teiCorpus.2? is the root element of the corpus,
that the external DTD resides at the given URL be-
longing to the TEI Consortium, and that a number
of TEI modules, detailed below, are being used to
parametrise the TEI to arrive at our particular DTD.
4.1 TEI.XML
TEI P4 allows both standard SGML and XML en-
codings. Including the TEI.XML option indicates
that the target DTD is to be expressed in XML.
4.2 TEI.prose
The base tagset does not declare many elements but
rather inherits all of the TEI core, which includes the
TEI header, and text elements. A TEI document will
typically have as its root element ?TEI.2? which is
composed of the ?teiHeader?, followed by the ?text?;
c.f. right hand side of Figure 2, but note that the root
element from the TEI.corpus module is used for the
complete corpus.
The TEI header describes an encoded work so that
the text (corpus) itself, its source, its encoding, and
its revisions are all thoroughly documented.
TEI.prose also contains elements and attributes
for describing text structure, e.g. ?div? for text divi-
sion, ?p? for paragraph, ?head? for text header, etc.
The tagset is therefore useful for encoding the gross
structure of the corpus texts; for an illustration again
see Figure 2.
4.3 TEI.linking
This additional tagset provides mechanisms for link-
ing, segmentation, and alignment. The elements
provided here enable links to be made e.g., between
the articles and their source URLs, or between con-
cepts and their hypernyms.
It should be noted that while the TEI treatment
of external pointers had been very influential, it was
overtaken and made obsolete by newer recommen-
dations. However, the TEI does have a Working
Group on Stand-Off Markup, XLink and XPointer,
which should produce new TEI encoding recom-
mendations for this area in 2003.
4.4 TEI.analysis
This additional tagset is used for associating sim-
ple linguistic analyses and interpretations with text
elements. It can be used to annotate words, ?w?,
clauses, ?cl?, and sentences, ?s? with dedicated tags,
as well as arbitrary and possibly nested segments
with the ?seg?. Such elements can be, via at-
tributes, associated with their analyses. This tagset
has proved very popular for PoS-annotated corpora;
for an illustration see Figure 3.
4.5 TEI.corpus
This additional tagset introduces a new root element,
?teiCorpus.2?, which comprises a (corpus) header
and a series of ?TEI.2? elements. The TEI.corpus
tagset alo extends the certain header elements to
provide more detailed descriptions of the corpus ma-
terial.
4.6 TEI.extensions.ent
The file gives, for each element sanctioned by the
chosen modules, whether we include or ignore it in
our parametrisation. While this is not strictly neces-
sary (without any such specification, all the elements
would be included) we thought it wise to constrain
the content models somewhat, to reduce the bewil-
dering variety of choices that the TEI otherwise of-
fers. Also, such an entity extension file gives the
complete list of all the TEI elements that are allowed
(and disallowed) in GENIA, which might prove use-
ful for documentation purposes.
4.7 TEI.extensions.dtd
This file specifies the changes we have made to TEI
elements. We have e.g., added the url attribute to
?xptr? and ?xref ? and tagging attributes to word and
punctuation elements.
4.8 Conversion of GPML to TEI
Because the source format of GENIA will remain
the simpler GPML, it is imperative to have an au-
tomatic procedure for converting to the TEI inter-
change format. The translation process takes advan-
tage of the fact that both the input and output are
encoded in XML, which makes it possible to use the
XSL Transformation Language, XSLT that defines a
standard declarative specification of transformations
between XML documents. There also exist a num-
ber of free XSLT processors; we used Daniel Veil-
lard?s xsltproc.
The transformation is written as a XSLT
stylesheet, which makes reference to two docu-
ments: the GENIA ontology in TEI and the template
for the corpus header. The stylesheet then resolves
the GPML encoded corpus into TEI. The translation
of the corpus is thus fully automatic, except for the
taxonomy, which was translated by hand.
Figure 2 illustrates the top level structure of the
corpus, and how it differs between the GPML and
TEI encodings. The most noticeable difference is,
apart from the renaming of elements, the addition
of headers to the corpus and texts. In the GENIA
?teiHeader? we give e.g., the name, address, avail-
ability, sampling description, and, for each abstract?s
?sourceDesc?, two ?xptr?s: the first gives the URL of
the HTML article in the MEDLINE database, while
the second is the URL of the article in the origi-
nal XML. It should be noted that we use a locally
defined url attribute for specifying the value of the
pointer.
5 Characteristics of biomedical texts
In this section we review some challenges that
biomedical texts present to the processing and en-
coding of linguistic information, and the manner of
their encoding in our DTD.
5.1 Tokens
Tokenisation, i.e., the identification of words and
punctuation marks, is the lowest level of linguistic
analysis, yet is, in spite (or because) of this of con-
siderable importance. As all other levels of linguis-
tic markup make direct or direct reference to the to-
ken stream of the text, so if this is incorrect, errors
will propagate to all other annotations.
It is also interesting to note that current annota-
tion practice is more and more leaning toward stand-
off markup, i.e., annotations that are separated from
the primary data (text) and make reference to it only
via pointers. However, it is beneficial to have some
markup in the primary data to which it is possible to
refer, and this markup is, almost exclusivelly, that of
tokens; see e.g., (Freese et al, 2003).
Version V1.1 of GENIA has been also annotated
with LTG tools (Grover et al, 2002). In short, the
corpus is tokenised, and then part-of-speech tagged
with two taggers, each one using a different tagset,
and the nouns and verbs lemmatised. Additionally,
the deverbal nominalisations are assigned their ver-
bal stems.
The conversion to TEI is also able to handle this
additional markup, by using the TEI.analysis mod-
ule. The word and punctuation tokens are encoded
as ?w? and ?c? elements respectively, which are fur-
ther marked with type and lemma and the locally de-
fined c1, c2 and vstem. An example of such markup
<s>
<w c1="DT" c2="DB">All</w>
<c type="HYPH" c1=":" c2="-">-</c>
<w c1="VBZ" c2="JJ">trans</w>
<w c1="JJ" c2="JJ">retinoic</w>
<w lemma="acid" c1="NN" c2="NN1">acid</w>
<c type="BR" c1="(" c2="(">(</c>
<w lemma="Ra" c1="NN" c2="NP1">RA</w>
<c type="BR" c1=")" c2=")">)</c>
<w lemma="be" c1="VBZ" c2="VBZ">is</w>
<w c1="DT" c2="AT1">an</w>
<w c1="JJ" c2="JJ">important</w>
...
Figure 3: TEI encoding of annotated tokens
is given in Figure 3.
Given the high density of technical terms,
biomedical texts are rife with various types of con-
tractions, such as abbreviations, acronyms, prefixes,
etc. As seen already in Figure 3, one of the
more problematic apects of tokenisaton are paren-
theses. Almost all tokenisers (e.g., the LT one, or
the UPENN tokeniser) take these as separate tokens,
but many are in biomedical texts parts of terms. So,
out of almost 35,000 distinct terms that have been
marked up in the GENIA corpus, over 1,700 con-
tain parentheses. Some examples: (+)-pentazocine,
(3H)-E2 binding, (gamma(c))-like molecule.
Correct tokenisation of the biomedical texts is
thus a challenging tasks, and it is fair to say that,
from a linguistic processing perspective, complex
tokenisation is one of the defining characteristics of
such corpora.
5.2 Terms
Annotation of terms is a prerequisite for meaningful
processing of biomedical texts, yet it is often diffi-
cult to decide what constitutes a term in a text, and
how to abstract away from local variations. Biomed-
ical texts are largerly (one could almost say excu-
sivelly) composed of terms, and, as mentioned, this
brings with it complex abbreviatory mechanisms.
Even though TEI offers a ?term? element, we
chose, in line with the original GPML encoding, to
rather use the TEI.analysis clause (?cl?) element to
encode terms. In GENIA, the terms have been hand-
annotated, and marked up with concepts from the
GENIA ontology; this was also the defining factor
of term-hood, namely that the term could be linked

Figure 2: The GPML and TEI structure of the corpus
to a terminal concept of the GENIA ontology.
In spite of the simple semantic definition, the syn-
tactic structure of the terms in the corpus varies
dramatically. Biomedical terms are in some ways
similar to named entities (names of people, orga-
nizations, etc.) but from the linguistic perspective,
they are different in that named entities are mostly
proper nouns, while terms mostly contain common
nouns, and the two differ in their syntactic proper-
ties. Terms in the corpus can also be nested, where
complex terms are composed out of simpler ones,
e.g., ?cl??cl?IL-2 gene?/cl? transcription?/cl?.
This nesting, and the reference to ontology con-
cepts is often far from simple, as (partial) terms can
appear in coordinated clauses involving ellipsis. For
example, ?CD2 and CD 25 receptors? refers to two
terms, CD2 receptors and CD25 receptors, but only
the latter actually appears in the text.
In such cases by parsing the coordination
all the terms can be identified and annotated;
the TEI encoding achieves this by specifyng
the propositional formula involving the par-
ticipating concepts in the function attribute;
for example, ?cl function=?(AND G.tissue
G.tissue)? ana=?G.tissue???cl?normal?/cl? and
?cl?hypopigmented?/cl? ?cl?skin samples?/cl??/cl?.
The ana attribute encodes the IDREF of the con-
cept; currently, only same valued concepts are either
conjoined or disjoined.
The number of ?cl? elements in the GENIA cor-
pus is 96,582, among which 89,682 are simple terms
and 1,583 are nested terms that are contain 3,431
terms. 5,137 terms do not yet have the ana attribute
for concept identification, so the total number of
ontology-linked terms is 93,293.
5.3 Ontologies
One of the more interesting questions in recoding
GENIA in TEI was how to encode the ontology. The
ontology is in GENIA GPML encoded in a separate
document, conforming to the OIL+DAML specifi-
cation. This, inter alia, means that that XML file
heavily relies on XML Namespaces and the RDF
recommendation. An illustrative fragment is given
on the left side of Figure 4.
Currently the GENIA ontology has a simple tree-
like structure, i.e., it corresponds to a taxonomy,
so we translated it to the TEI ?taxonomy? element,
which is contained in the ?classDecl? of the header
?encodingDesc?. The TEI defines this element
as ?[the classification declaration] contains one or
more taxonomies defining any classificatory codes
used elsewhere in the text?, i.e., is exactly suited for
our purposes.
There are quite substantial differences between
the two encodings: the DAML+OIL models class
inclusion with links, while the TEI does it as XML
element inclusion. This is certainly the simpler and
more robust solution, but requires that the ontol-
ogy is a taxonomy, i.e., tree structured. The sec-
ond difference is in the status of the identifiers: in
DAML+OIL they are general #CDATA links, which
need a separate (XLink/XPointer) mechanisms for
their resolution. In TEI they are XML ID attributes,
<daml:Class rdf:ID="source"></daml:Class> <taxonomy id="G.taxonomy">
<daml:Class rdf:ID="natural"> <category id="G.source">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#source"/> <catDesc>biological source</catDesc>
</daml:Class> <category id="G.natural">
<daml:Class rdf:ID="organism"> <catDesc>natural</catDesc>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#natural"/> <category id="G.organism">
</daml:Class> <catDesc>organism</catDesc>
<daml:Class rdf:ID="multi_cell"> <category id="G.multi_cell">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#organism"/> <catDesc>multi-cellular</catDesc>
</daml:Class> </category>
... ...

and can rely on the XML parser to resolve them.
While this is a simpler solution, it does support
document-internal reference only.
6 Conclusions
The paper proposed an XML paramterisation of TEI
P4 developed for linguistically annotated biomedi-
cal corpora, and applied it to the GENIA corpus.
The conversion from the Genia Project Markup Lan-
guage to this encoding has been implemented in
XSLT and both the TEI-conformant parametrisation
(TEI extension file and one-file DTD) and the XSLT
stylesheets are, together with a report documenting
them, available at http://nl.ijs.si/et/genia/, while the

The paper gave a survey of the TEI modules that
can be useful for encoding a wide variety of linguis-
tically annotated corpora. This contribution, it is
hoped, can thus serve as a blueprint for parametris-
ing TEI for diverse corpus resources.
Further work involves the inclusion of other
knowledge sources into the corpus, say of Medi-
cal Subject Headings (MeSH), Unified Medical Lan-
guage System (UMLS), International Classification
of Disease (ICD), etc. The place of these annota-
tions in the corpus will have to be considered, and
their linking to the existing information determined.
