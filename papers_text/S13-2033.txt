Abstract
We present our system WSD2 which partic-
ipated in the Cross-Lingual Word-Sense Dis-
ambiguation task for SemEval 2013 (Lefever
and Hoste, 2013). The system closely resem-
bles our winning system for the same task in
SemEval 2010. It is based on k-nearest neigh-
bour classifiers which map words with local
and global context features onto their transla-
tion, i.e. their cross-lingual sense. The sys-
tem participated in the task for all five lan-
guages and obtained winning scores for four
of them when asked to predict the best trans-
lation(s). We tested various configurations of
our system, focusing on various levels of hy-
perparameter optimisation and feature selec-
tion. Our final results indicate that hyperpa-
rameter optimisation did not lead to the best
results, indicating overfitting by our optimisa-
tion method in this aspect. Feature selection
does have a modest positive impact.
1 Introduction
WSD2 is a rewrite and extension of our previous
system (van Gompel, 2010) that participated in the
Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task in
SemEval 2010 (Lefever and Hoste, 2010). In WSD2
we introduce and test a new level of hyperparame-
ter optimisation. Unlike the previous occasion, we
participate in all five target languages (Dutch, Span-
ish, Italian, French, and German). The task presents
twenty polysemous nouns with fifty instances each
to be mapped onto normalised (lemmatised) transla-
tions in all languages. The task is described in detail
by Lefever and Hoste (2013).
Trial data is provided and has been used to op-
timise system parameters. Due to the unsupervised
nature of the task, no training data is provided. How-
ever, given that the gold standard of the task is based
exclusively on the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn,
2005), we select that same corpus to minimise our
chances of delivering translations that the human
annotators preparing the test data could have never
picked.
Systems may output several senses per instance,
rather than producing just one sense prediction.
These are evaluated in two different ways. The scor-
ing type ?best? expects that the system outputs the
sense it considers the most likely, or a number of
senses in the order of its confidence in these senses
being correct. Multiple guesses are penalised, how-
ever. In contrast, the scoring type ?out of five? ex-
pects five guesses, in which each answer carries the
same weight. These metrics are more extensively
described in Mihalcea et al (2010) and Lefever and
Hoste (2013).
2 System Description
The WSD2 system, like its predecessor, distributes
the task over word experts. Each word expert
is a k-nearest neighbour classifier specialising in
the disambiguation of a single of the twenty pro-
vided nouns. This is implemented using the Tilburg
Memory Based Learner (TiMBL) (Daelemans et al,
2009). The classifiers are trained as follows: First
the parallel corpus which acts as training data is to-
kenised using Ucto (van Gompel et al, 2012), for
all five language pairs. Then, a word-alignment be-
tween sentence pairs in the Europarl training data
is established, for which we use GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2000). We use the intersection of both
translation directions, as we know the sense reposi-
183
tory from which the human annotators preparing the
task?s test data can select their translations is created
in the same fashion.
Whilst the word alignment is computed on the ac-
tual word forms, we also need lemmas for both the
source language (English) as well as for all of the
five target languages. The English nouns in the test
data can be either singular or plural, and both forms
may occur in the input. Second, the target transla-
tions all have to be mapped to their lemma forms.
Moreover, to be certain we are dealing with nouns
in the source language, a Part-of-Speech tagger is
also required. PoS tagging and lemmatisation is con-
ducted using Freeling (Atserias et al, 2006) for En-
glish, Spanish and Italian; Frog (van den Bosch et
al., 2007) for Dutch, and TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994)
for German and French.
With all of this data generated, we then iterate
over all sentences in the parallel corpus and extract
occurrences of any of the twenty nouns, along with
the translation they are aligned to according to the
word alignment. We extract the words themselves
and compute the lemma and the part-of-speech tag,
and do the same for a specified number of words
to the left and to the right of the found occurrence.
These constitute the local context features.
In addition to this, global context features are ex-
tracted; these are a set of keywords per lemma and
per translation which are found occurring above cer-
tain occurrence thresholds at arbitrary positions in
the same sentence, as this is the widest context sup-
plied in the task data. The global context features
are represented as a binary bag-of-words model in
which the presence of each of the keywords that may
be indicative for a given mapping of the focus word
to a sense is represented by a boolean value. Such a
set of keywords is constructed for each of the twenty
nouns, per language.
The method used to extract these keywords (k)
is proposed by Ng and Lee (1996) and used also
by Hoste et al (2002). Assume we have a focus
word f , more precisely, a lemma of one of the tar-
get nouns. We also have one of its aligned transla-
tions/senses s, also a lemma. We can now estimate
P (s|k), the probability of sense s, given a keyword
k. Let Ns,klocal. be the number of occurrences of a
possible local context word k with particular focus
word lemma-PoS combination and with a particular
sense s. Let Nklocal be the number of occurrences
of a possible local context keyword k with a partic-
ular focus word-PoS combination regardless of its
sense. If we also take into account the frequency of
a possible keyword k in the complete training corpus
(Nkcorpus), we get:
P (s|k) =
Ns,klocal
Nklocal
(
1
Nkcorpus
) (1)
Hoste et al (2002) select a keyword k for inclu-
sion in the bag-of-words representation if that key-
word occurs more than T1 times in that sense s, and
if P (s|k) ? T2. Both T1 and T2 are predefined
thresholds, which by default were set to 3 and 0.001
respectively. In addition, WSD2 and its predecessor
WSD1 contain an extra parameter which can be en-
abled to automatically adjust the T1 threshold when
it yields too many or too few keywords. The selec-
tion of bag-of-word features is computed prior to the
extraction of the training instances, as this informa-
tion is a prerequisite for the successful generation of
both training and test instances.
3 Feature and Hyperparameter
Optimisation
The size of the local context, the inclusion of global
context features, and the inclusion of syntactic fea-
tures are all features that can be selected, changed,
or disabled, allowing for a variety of combinations
to be tested. In addition, each word expert is a k-
nearest neighbour classifier that can take on many
hyperparameters beyond k. In the present study we
performed both optimisations for all word experts,
but the optimisations were performed independently
to reduce complexity: we optimised classifier hyper-
parameters on the basis of the training examples ex-
tracted from our parallel corpus, producing optimal
accuracy on each word-expert. We optimised fea-
ture selection on the basis of the trial data provided
for the task. As has been argued before (Hoste et al,
2002), the joint search space of feature selection and
hyperparameters is prohibitively large. Our current
setup runs the risk of finding hyperparameters that
are not optimal for the feature selection in the sec-
ond optimisation step. Our final results indeed show
that only feature selection produced improved re-
sults. We choose the feature selection with the high-
184

sizes
est score on the trial set, for each of the nouns and
separately for both evaluation metrics in the task.
To optimise the choice of hyperparameters per
word expert, a heuristic parameter search algo-
rithm (van den Bosch, 2004)1 was used that imple-
ments wrapped progressive sampling using cross-
validation: it performs a large number of experi-
ments with many hyperparameter setting combina-
tions on small samples of training data, and then
progressively zooms in on combinations estimated
to perform well with larger samples of the training
data. As a control run we also trained word experts
with default hyperparameters, i.e. with k = 1 and
with all other hyperparameters at their default val-
ues as specified in the TiMBL implementation.
4 Experiments & Results
To assess the accuracy of a certain configuration of
our system as a whole, we take the average over all
word experts. An initial experiment on the trial data
explores the impact of different context sizes, with
hyperparameter optimisation on the classifiers. The
results, shown in Figure 1, clearly indicate that on
average the classifiers perform best with a local con-
text of just one word to the left and one to the right of
the word to be disambiguated. Larger context sizes
have a negative impact on average accuracy. These
tests include hyperparameter optimisation, but the
same trend shows without.

Table 2: Results on the trial data
We submitted three configurations of our system
to the shared task, the maximum number of runs.
Adding lemma features to the local context win-
dow of three words proves beneficial in general, as
shown in Table 1. This is therefore the first configu-
ration we submitted (c1l). As second configuration
(c1lN) we submitted the same configuration with-
out parameter optimisation on the classifiers. Note
that neither of these include global context features.
The third configuration (var) we submitted in-
cludes feature selection, and selects per word ex-
pert the configuration that has the highest score on
the trial data, and thus tests all kinds of configura-
tions. Note that hyperparameter optimisation is also
enabled for this configuration. Due to the feature
selection on the trial data, we by definition obtain
the highest scores on this trial data, but this carries
the risk of overfitting. Results on the trial data are
shown in Table 2.
The hyperparameter optimisation on classifier ac-
curacy has a slightly negative impact, suggesting
overfitting on the training data. Therefore a fourth
configuration (varN) was tried later to indepen-
185
dently assess the idea of feature selection, without
hyperparameter optimisation on the classifiers. This
proves to be a good idea. However, the fourth con-
figuration was not yet available for the actual com-
petition. This incidentally would have had no impact
on the final ranking between competitors. When we
run these systems on the actual test data of the shared
task, we obtain the results in Table 3. The best score
amongst the other competitors is mentioned in the
last row for reference, this is the HLTDI team (Rud-
nick et al, 2013) for all but Best-Spanish, which
goes to the NRC contribution (Carpuat, 2013).

Table 3: Results on the test set
A major factor in this task is the accuracy of lem-
matisation, and to lesser extent of PoS tagging. We
conducted additional experiments on German and
French without lemmatisation, tested on the trial
data. Results immediately fell below baseline.
Another main factor is the quality of the word
alignments, and the degree to which the found word
alignments correspond with the translations the hu-
man annotators could choose from in preparing the
gold standard. An idea we tested is, instead of rely-
ing on the mere intersection of word alignments, to
use a phrase-translation table generated by and for
the Statistical Machine Translation system Moses
(Koehn et al, 2007), which uses the grow-diag-final
heuristic to extract phrase pairs. This results in more
phrases, and whilst this is a good idea for MT, in
the current task it has a detrimental effect, as it cre-
ates too many translation options and we do not have
an MT decoder to discard ineffective options in this
task. The grow-diag-final heuristic incorporates un-
aligned words to the end of a translation in the trans-
lation option, a bad idea for CLWSD.
5 Conclusion
In this study we have taken parameter optimisation
one step further compared to our previous research
(van Gompel, 2010), namely by selecting system pa-
rameters per word expert from the best configura-
tions on the trial data. Optimising the hyperparam-
eter of the classifiers on the training data proves to
have a slightly negative effect, especially when com-
bined with the selection of features. This is likely
due to the fact that feature selection was performed
after hyperparameter optimisation, causing certain
optimisations to be rendered ineffective.
We can furthermore uphold the conclusion from
previous research that including lemma features is
generally a good idea. As to the number of local
context features, we observed that a context size of
one feature to the left, and one to the right, has the
best overall average accuracy. Eventually, due to
our feature selection without hyperparameter opti-
misation on the classifier not being available yet at
the time of submission, our simplest system c1lN
emerged as best in the contest.
When asked to predict the best translation(s), our
system comes out on top for four out of five lan-
guages; only for Spanish we are surpassed by two
competitors. Our out-of-five predictions win for two
out of five languages, and are fairly close the the best
competitor for the others, except again for Spanish.
We assumed independence between hyperparam-
eter optimisation and feature selection, where the
former was conducted using cross-validation on the
training data rather than on the development set. As
this independence assumption is a mere simplifi-
cation to reduce algorithmic complexity, future re-
search could focus on a more integrated approach
and test hyperparameter optimisation of the classi-
fiers on the trial set which may produce better scores.
The WSD2 system is available as open-source un-
der the GNU Public License v3. It is implemented
in Python (van Rossum, 2006) and can be obtained
from http://github.com/proycon/wsd22. The experi-
mental data and results are included in the git repos-
itory as well.
2git commit f10e796141003d8a2fbaf8c463588a6d7380c05e
represents a fair state of the system at the time of submission
