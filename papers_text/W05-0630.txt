Abstract
We present a four-step hierarchical SRL
strategy which generalizes the classical
two-level approach (boundary detection
and classification). To achieve this, we
have split the classification step by group-
ing together roles which share linguistic
properties (e.g. Core Roles versus Ad-
juncts). The results show that the non-
optimized hierarchical approach is com-
putationally more efficient than the tradi-
tional systems and it preserves their accu-
racy.
1 Introduction
For accomplishing the CoNLL 2005 Shared Task
on Semantic Role Labeling (Carreras and Ma`rquez,
2005), we capitalized on our experience on the se-
mantic shallow parsing by extending our system,
widely experimented on PropBank and FrameNet
(Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004) data, with a two-
step boundary detection and a hierarchical argument
classification strategy.
Currently, the system can work in both basic and
enhanced configuration. Given the parse tree of an
input sentence, the basic system applies (1) a bound-
ary classifier to select the nodes associated with cor-
rect arguments and (2) a multi-class labeler to assign
the role type. For such models, we used some of the
linear (e.g. (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Pradhan et
al., 2005)) and structural (Moschitti, 2004) features
developed in previous studies.
In the enhanced configuration, the boundary an-
notation is subdivided in two steps: a first pass in
which we label argument boundary and a second
pass in which we apply a simple heuristic to elimi-
nate the argument overlaps. We have also tried some
strategies to learn such heuristics automatically. In
order to do this we used a tree kernel to classify the
subtrees associated with correct predicate argument
structures (see (Moschitti et al, 2005)). The ratio-
nale behind such an attempt was to exploit the cor-
relation among potential arguments.
Also, the role labeler is divided into two steps:
(1) we assign to the arguments one out of four possi-
ble class labels: Core Roles, Adjuncts, Continuation
Arguments and Co-referring Arguments, and (2) in
each of the above class we apply the set of its spe-
cific classifiers, e.g. A0,..,A5 within the Core Role
class. As such grouping is relatively new, the tradi-
tional features may not be sufficient to characterize
each class. Thus, to generate a large set of features
automatically, we again applied tree kernels.
Since our SRL system exploits the PropBank for-
malism for internal data representation, we devel-
oped ad-hoc procedures to convert back and forth
to the CoNLL Shared Task format. This conversion
step gave us useful information about the amount
and the nature of the parsing errors. Also, we could
measure the frequency of the mismatches between
syntax and role annotation.
In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 describes
the basic system configuration whereas Section 3 il-
lustrates its enhanced properties and the hierarchical
structure. Section 4 describes the experimental set-
ting and the results. Finally, Section 5 summarizes
201
our conclusions.
2 The Basic Semantic Role Labeler
In the last years, several machine learning ap-
proaches have been developed for automatic role la-
beling, e.g. (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Pradhan
et al, 2005). Their common characteristic is the
adoption of flat feature representations for predicate-
argument structures. Our basic system is similar to
the one proposed in (Pradhan et al, 2005) and it is
described hereafter.
We divided the predicate argument labeling in two
subtasks: (a) the detection of the arguments related
to a target, i.e. all the compounding words of such
argument, and (b) the classification of the argument
type, e.g. A0 or AM. To learn both tasks we used the
following algorithm:
1. Given a sentence from the training-set, generate
a full syntactic parse-tree;
2. Let P and A be respectively the set of predicates
and the set of parse-tree nodes (i.e. the potential ar-
guments);
3. For each pair <p, a> ? P ?A:
- extract the feature representation set, Fp,a;
- if the subtree rooted in a covers exactly the
words of one argument of p, put Fp,a in T+
(positive examples), otherwise put it in T?
(negative examples).
We trained the SVM boundary classifier on T+ and
T? sets and the role labeler i on the T+i , i.e. its pos-
itive examples and T?i , i.e. its negative examples,
where T+ = T+i ? T?i , according to the ONE-vs.-
ALL scheme. To implement the multi-class clas-
sifiers we select the argument associated with the
maximum among the SVM scores.
To represent the Fp,a pairs we used the following
features:
- the Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word,
Governing Category, Position and Voice defined in
(Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002);
- the Partial Path, Compressed Path, No Direction
Path, Constituent Tree Distance, Head Word POS,
First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, SubCate-
gorization and Head Word of Prepositional Phrases
proposed in (Pradhan et al, 2005); and
- the Syntactic Frame designed in (Xue and Palmer,
2004).

beler.
3 Hierarchical Semantic Role Labeler
Having two phases for argument labeling provides
two main advantages: (1) the efficiency is increased
as the negative boundary examples, which are al-
most all parse-tree nodes, are used with one clas-
sifier only (i.e. the boundary classifier), and (2) as
arguments share common features that do not occur
in the non-arguments, a preliminary classification
between arguments and non-arguments advantages
the boundary detection of roles with fewer training
examples (e.g. A4). Moreover, it may be simpler
to classify the type of roles when the not-argument
nodes are absent.
Following this idea, we generalized the above two
level strategy to a four-step role labeling by group-
ing together the arguments sharing similar proper-
ties. Figure 1, shows the hierarchy employed for ar-
gument classification:
During the first phase, we select the parse tree
nodes which are likely predicate arguments. An
SVM with moderately high recall is applied for such
purpose.
In the second phase, a simple heuristic which se-
lects non-overlapping nodes from those derived in
the previous step is applied. Two nodes n1 and n2
do not overlap if n1 is not ancestor of n2 and vicev-
ersa. Our heuristic simply eliminates the nodes that
cause the highest number of overlaps. We have also
studied how to train an overlap resolver by means of
tree kernels; the promising approach and results can
be found in (Moschitti et al, 2005).
In the third phase, we classify the detected argu-
ments in the following four classes: AX, i.e. Core
202
Arguments, AM, i.e. Adjuncts, CX, i.e. Continua-
tion Arguments and RX, i.e. the Co-referring Argu-
ments. The above classification relies on linguistic
reasons. For example Core arguments class contains
the arguments specific to the verb frames while Ad-
junct Arguments class contains arguments that are
shared across all verb frames.
In the fourth phase, we classify the members
within the classes of the previous level, e.g. A0 vs.
A1, ..., A5.
4 The Experiments
We experimented our approach with the CoNLL
2005 Shared Task standard dataset, i.e. the Pen-
nTree Bank, where sections from 02 to 21 are used
as training set, Section 24 as development set (Dev)
and Section 23 as the test set (WSJ). Additionally,
the Brown corpus? sentences were also used as the
test set (Brown). As input for our feature extractor
we used only the Charniak?s parses with their POSs.
The evaluations were carried out with the SVM-
light-TK software (Moschitti, 2004) available at
http://ai-nlp.info.uniroma2.it/moschitti/
which encodes the tree kernels in the SVM-light
software (Joachims, 1999). We used the default
polynomial kernel (degree=3) for the linear feature
representations and the tree kernels for the structural
feature processing.
As our feature extraction module was designed
to work on the PropBank project annotation format
(i.e. the prop.txt index file), we needed to generate
it from the CoNLL data. Each PropBank annota-
tion refers to a parse tree node which exactly cov-
ers the target argument but when using automatic
parses such node may not exist. For example, on
the CoNLL Charniak?s parses, (sections 02-21 and
24), we discovered that this problem affects 10,293
out of the 241,121 arguments (4.3%) and 9,741 sen-
tences out of 87,257 (11.5%). We have found out
that most of the errors are due to wrong parsing at-
tachments. This observation suggests that the capa-
bility of discriminating between correct and incor-
rect parse trees is a key issue in the boundary de-
tection phase and it must be properly taken into ac-
count.
4.1 Basic System Evaluation
For the boundary classifier we used a SVM with
the polynomial kernel of degree 3. We set the reg-
ularization parameter, c, to 1 and the cost factor,
j to 7 (to have a slightly higher recall). To re-
duce the learning time, we applied a simple heuristic
which removes the nodes covering the target predi-
cate node. From the initial 4,683,777 nodes (of sec-
tions 02-21), the heuristic removed 1,503,100 nodes
with a loss of 2.6% of the total arguments. How-
ever, as we started the experiments in late, we used
only the 992,819 nodes from the sections 02-08. The
classifier took about two days and half to converge
on a 64 bits machine (2.4 GHz and 4Gb Ram).
The multiclassifier was built with 52 binary ar-
gument classifiers. Their training on all arguments
from sec 02-21, (i.e. 242,957), required about a half
day on a machine with 8 processors (32 bits, 1.7
GHz and overll 4Gb Ram).
We run the role multiclassifier on the output of the
boundary classifier. The results on the Dev, WSJ and
Brown test data are shown in Table 1. Note that, the
overlapping nodes cause the generation of overlap-
ping constituents in the sentence annotation. This
prevents us to use the CoNLL evaluator. Thus, we
used the overlap resolution algorithm also for the ba-
sic system.
4.2 Hierarchical Role Labeling Evaluation
As the first two phases of the hierarchical labeler are
identical to the basic system, we focused on the last
two phases. We carried out our studies over the Gold
Standard boundaries in the presence of arguments
that do not have a perfect-covering node in the Char-
niak trees.
To accomplish the third phase, we re-organized
the flat arguments into the AX, AM, CX and RX
classes and we built a single multi-classifier. For
the fourth phase, we built a multi-classifier for each
of the above classes: only the examples related to
the target class were used, e.g. the AX mutliclas-
sifier was designed with the A0,..,A5 ONE-vs-ALL
binary classifiers.
In rows 2 and 3, Table 2 shows the numbers of
training and development set instances. Row 4 con-
tains the F1 of the binary classifiers of the third
phase whereas Row 5 reports the F1 of the result-
ing multi-classifier. Row 6 presents the F1s of the
multi-classifiers of the fourth phase.
Row 7 illustrates the F1 measure of the fourth
phase classifier applied to the third phase output. Fi-

5 Final Remarks
In this paper we analyzed the impact of a hierarchi-
cal categorization on the semantic role labeling task.
The results show that such approach produces an ac-
curacy similar to the flat systems with a higher ef-
ficiency. Moreover, some preliminary experiments
show that each node of the hierarchy requires differ-
ent features to optimize the associated multiclassi-
fier. For example, we found that the SCF tree kernel
(Moschitti, 2004) improves the AX multiclassifier

the classification within the other classes, e.g. AM.
Future work on the optimization of each phase is
needed to study the potential accuracy limits of the
proposed hierarchical approach.
