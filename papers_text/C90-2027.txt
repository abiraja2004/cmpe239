1 In t roduct ion  
Syntactical robustness is a desired design pro- 
perry of natural language parsers. Within the 
past decade, several developmental robustness 
approaches have been %rwarded: Syntax-free se- 
mantic passing \[1\] co,~lstraint relaxation after 
parse failure in a pattern matching \[2\] or ATN 
framework \[:3,4\], parse tree fittiug \[5\] and several 
non-formalized case frame approaches (e.g. the 
parser series in \[6,7\]). Three approaches \[5,8,9\] 
account for special defectivities by extending 
grarnmatical coverage. This paper refo,:mulates 
the so-called weakness approach, first, published 
in \[I0\], which extends robustness to declarative 
parsing formalisms. 
There are serious shortcomings in robustness re- 
search, emerging fl'om the common view of ro- 
bustness as a parsing and not as a representa- 
tion problem. Typically, two distinct representa- 
tion levels for grammatical nd non-grammatical 
language are assumed. The former is given by 
the basic fi'amework, the latter by relaxed pat- 
tern slots \[2\] or ATN arc re.sis \[3\], by "non- 
grammatical" meta-rules \[4\], by some construc- 
tion specific strategies \[6,7\] or by the schema me- 
chanism \[11\]. \Virile formalism syntax is somet;i- 
rues specified (e.g. \[4,10\]), ~ semantics of robust 
grmmnar formalisms, being m'.cessa.ry to define 
these two representation levels, has not been gi- 
ven vet. Without a well-defined formalism se- 
mantics, it is impossible to predict the behaviour 
of a (robust) grammar fragment when applied 
to non-grammatical l nguage. Therefore, no ro- 
bustness methodology has been available until 
llOW,

sm'Iicient and its adequacy w.r.t, defecti.v?~ !an-

tion of the notion of weakness needs a conside- 
rable formal apparatus.

A WACSG grammar ule is a context Dee pro- 
duction annotated with an attribute-value- (av- 
) formula. The following two subsections deal 
with weakness relations for context free gram- 
mars and av-languages. Section 3.3, then, sp,~ci - 
ties the \\"ACSG formalism semanlics.

free grammar G =< Cal, I.e,~:, Pr,,q's(~ > are 
defined, where Cat and Lcx are sets of nonter- 
rninal and terminal symbols, respectively, P r  a 
set. of productions and >;set a set. of start sym- 
bols. Now let I'w a set of substrings of w and

simply, ,~'\]'2T((/) equa.ls L(G) +. SUB((J) allows 
an undefined leftside and/or rightside snbstring 
and PAI~(G) even undefined infix substrings for 
every element from L(G).

L(G) n } 
PAR(G)  = e I e n L(G) } 
Partial string languages have appealing formal 
properties: ?(G) for ? E {SET, SUB, PAR} 
is context-free, contains c i f f  L(G) contains c 
and there is an order L(G) C SET(a) c 
SUB(G) c_ PAR(G). Nesting partial string lan- 
guages introduces a set ~(G) of languages uch 
as e.g. SET(SUB(G)),SET(PAR(G)).  We have 
I??(G)l = 1, i.e. a lie languages with maximal 
ope.rator ? are weakly equivalent, though not. 
pairwise strongly equivalent. 
A recurs?re partial string grarnmar (RPSG) is 
obtained by indexing rights?de (nonterminal) 
symbols of a cfg G with indices SET, SUB, or 
PAR. The formalism- semantics for an RP~G is 
given by a derivation relation (cf.\[15\]) for non- 
indexed and SET-indexed nodes of a tree graph 
and by a generation function gen as displayed in 
2 for any other nodes. Let Q(G) the set of deri- 
vations for a given G, w E Q(G) a derivation 
and tw its tree graph. Let lw be a label function 
with l~o(O) 6 Ssetind a (possibly indexed) start 
symbol ~ The languages L(G) (derived language) 
and RPSL(G) (generated language) are defined 
in .3. L(G) and RPSL(G) are context-free and 
we have L(G) C RPSL(G), L(G) usually being 
much smaller than RPSL(G).

3.2  At t r ibute -Va lue  Languages  
The av-language c9 is a first order predicate lo- 
gic including l-dry function symbols and two 2- 
dry predicates "~" and "E"for equality and set 
membership, respectively. Soundness and com- 
pleteness of 0 without E have been proven in 
\[16\]. The predicate "E" introduces well-founded, 
distributive, recurs?re sets of attribute-value- 
structures, and is discussed in \[17\] . We as- 
sume the existence of a reduction algorithm 
RNF with RNF(A)  E O, iff is A satisfiable 
and RNF(A) = 2_ otherwise (for any formula 
AE!O)  2

Robustness in the area of av-languages i the 
ability to cope with inconsistent (i.e. overspeei- 
fled) formulae. Two different methods for main- 
taining consistency will be considered, namely 
set weakening and default formulae. 
3.2.1 Set weaken ing  
In robustness theory, the purpose of av-sets 
is to weaken the flmction condition on dr- 
structures. Set weakening may be used e.g. tbr 
the transition from an inconsistent formula A = 
x(syn)(case) ~ nora A x(syn)(case)~ akk to 
a consistent (therefore non-equivalent) formula 
A x(syn)(case)=xl  ~ nom Axa~ akk As1 E 
x(syn)(case) A x2 C x(syn)(case). This U'ansi- 
tion preserves case information, but not incon- 
sistency for the denotatmn J\[x~ . In general, set 
weakening is defined as follows: 
(4) 
Let A E cO a fonmfla in disjunctive nor-- 
mal form and t a non-constant tenn. Let. L ? A 
{Ai,j.k It occurs k - t imes  in a literalAi.j} a set 
of indices. For any r E L~t , zr is a variable 
not occuring in A. The set weakening of A for a 
term t is 
For any A 6 cO and non-constant term t it has 
been shown (see \[17\]) that, if RNF(A)  = A # ?, 
then also DNF(At)  = RNF(A ~) # 1. There- 
fore, if A is satisfiable, then A t is also satisfia- 
ble. Since satisfiability of A does not follow from 
satisfiability of A ~ (see above), A t is weaker-of 
equivalent to A. However, the theoretically mo- 
tivated Aqnotation has not been integrated into 
WACSG formalism, since set weakening can be 
achieved by using the predicate "6". 
3.2.2 Dethu l ts  
r?he classical subsurnption ~_ gives a partial or- 
dering within tile set of av-models. There are, ho- 
wever, no inconsistent models. Therefore, a par- 
tiality notion with inconsistency must be based 
upon descriptions i.e. av-formulae. The relation 
3-partial _C 0 ~ is a subsumption-isomorphisrn 
into a (canonical) subset of 0. The relation 0- 
partial defined below is still weaker in allowing 
inconsistency ofone formula B and can be shown 
to be a superset of 3-partial, i.e. 3-partial C_ 0- 
partial. 
Let I 6 0 aconjunctionofl iterals, and A,B 6 
CO . Then A 0-partial B iff: 
1. RNF(A A I) ? RNF(A) 
2. RNF(A A I) = RNF(B) ,  if RNF(B)  7! 2 
DNF(A A I) = DN F(B) otherwise 
2 157 
a. leNF(A) ? 
Tile formula I C c) may be restricted to be a 
conjunction of default literals, whose predicate 
is marked with a. subscript a. This gives a de- 
fault relation, which is a subset of a superset 
of subsumption between formulae. A relation of 
default-satisfiability "l=a" may be based upon 
this default relation. It is easy to demonstrate 
that a default-relation like this has some desired 
disambiguation properties: a disjunctive formula 
A = A1 VA2 is reduced to RN.F(A1 A I) by con- 
joining it with a default formula I G 0 such 
that RNF(A2 A I) = I. 
4 WACSG formal i sm se -  
mant ics  
For any WACSG-Grammar G, a domain D(G) 
and its subset SDDE(G) of strictly derivable 
domain elements is defined as follows. Any do- 
main element not in SDDE(G) bears weak- 
hess relations to a derivation co C Q(G) , 
where w(0)(1) G Ssctind .Anyformulaw(i ) (2)  
(0 <~ i <_ leo) may be inconsistent. Now, a gram- 
mar G is called weak iff D(C;) -SDDE(G) ? O. 
(s) 
Let; C be a WACSG grammar, G 1~ the cf base of 
G and ~'~ the cf part of a derivation w E f~(G) 
? Let M be the set of av-mode!s.

cannot be simulated by anything else in WACSG 
formalism. For every WACSG grammar G, ho- 
wever, there is an equivalent WACSG grammar 
G' without any partial string indices within it. 
This grammar G' shows an extreme complexity 
already for a few indices in G. This fact chal- 
lenges the view (see e.g. \[8\]) that robustness can 
be achieved by coverage xtension of any non- 
weakeable ACSG. 
5 A WACSG-t reatment  o f  
res tar ts  
in t;his section, the WACSG formalism is applied 
to restarts, a class of spoken language construe- 
tions, which is often referred to in robustness li- 
terature \[2,3,4\]. A grammatical explanation, ho- 
wever, is still lacking. The German restart data 
in 7 are given with transliteration and segmen- 
tation. Constructions in 7,8 are ungrammatical, 
but not inacceptable.

From the viewpoint of robustness theory, a rest- 
art < a/3 A S~7, M > 6 D(G) should not be 
in SDDE(G) exactly if it is defect, where G is 
a realistic WACSG fragment of the language in 
question. Roughly, restarts are a kind of phra- 
sal coordination ot allowing for deletion phe- 
nomena such as ellipsis, gapping or left deletion. 
Additionally, the ~-substring (i) does not contri- 
bute to (extensional) meaning a of the construc- 
tion and, (ii), may show recursive defectivenes- 
ses such as contanfination and constituent break 
(examples 9,10).

5.1 NP- res tar ts  
The following WACSG rules 11-14 deal with 
openly coordinated NP restarts and are easily 
generalized to prepositional, adverbial or ad- 
jectival phrase restarts. Under the coordina- 
tion hypothesis, a parallelism between defective 
and non-defective restarts is assumed. Right- 
recursive coordination of defective and nondefec- 
tive conjuncts is unrestricted. In 11, equations i- 
mulating semantic and syntactic projections (see 
\[18\]) "control up" the syntactic but not, the se- 
mantic description of a f l  conjunct in a restart 
construction. 
In rules 13,14, partial string indices ,sef3r~ und 
PAH allow a defect conjunct to cover a prefix 
substring (if no phonological restart marker of 
category AC is present) or every substring (if 
there is a restart marker). 
aHowever ,  it  does  cont r ibute  t,o mean ing  in an  in ten-  
s iona l  sense:  ~3-substr ings are  not, absurd .  
158 3 
i~,ulc 1.1 applies set weakening to the syntactic 
av structures of both conjuncts, resulting in a 
well-l:nown coordina.tion treatment \[19\]. Default 
eqtmtions provide disaml)iguation to syntactic 
features \[~x:(syn)(case)~ and ~x:(syn)(gender)\]\] 
, since defectiviV may render the first conjunct 
ambiguous 4. Furthermore, rule 15 shows default 
weakening of the syntactic description of NP's.

Within a simulated projection theory, con- 
trolling down a verbal argument into 
a vcomp-embedded element of a.n av- 
set requires a complex regular term 
x( syn )+\[ (vcomp)(syn) +\]*, which is ex- 
pensive to compute. Therefore, rules 16,18 
introduce an additional term x(kosem), 
such that \[\[;c(kosem)\]\] is the semantic struc- 
ture of a set Ix\] of openly coordina- 
ted av.-structures. By default satisfiability 
of x(sem) ~d x(kosem), \[\[x(sem)~ equals 
~\[x(kosem)~ except if \[\[x~ is the av set of a 
non-restart coordination. 
Since defectivity, e.g. a constituent, break. 
may render incomplete the fl verbal phrase 
incomplete, rule 17 provides semantic de- 
fault values for every possible semantic ar- 
gument. 
l)istribut.ed av formulae may be necessary 
for one conjunct but inconsistent with (the 
description of) the other. This situation 
ma.y arise due to contamination of the 
first: (fl-) conjunct. Independently it can be 
shown that contaminations almost exclusi- 
vely affect syntactic (as opposed to seman- 
tic) t~atures. Now, if the conditions cohe- 
rence and completeness ( ee \[11\]) are deti- 
ned on semantic structure, syntactic cohe- 
rence can be inforced by lexicalized formu- 
lae as shown in 19 that depend on a syntac- 
tic defectivity feature ~x(syn)(defec)\]

6 Conclusion 
The reformulation of robustness theory as a 
theory of weak grammars (and, consequently, of 
robust parsing as parsing of weak grammars) has 
enabled both the specification of working par- 
sets \[17\] and a substantial explanation of non- 
gl'ammatical langua;ge. Further study has to be 
done. Cross-linguistlc resear& on defective con- 
st.ructions (e,g. non-grammatical el ipses) and a 
default logic ma~oching methodological standards 
of A1 theory remain important desiderata,. Our 
prediction {hat there is no strong theory of de- 
fectiveness, however, invites for falsification.
