Abstract 
In this ~paper, we present he Interlingua 
system ISS to generate the pronominal 
anaphora into the Spanish and English 
languages. We also describe the main 
problems in the pronoun generation into 
both languages such as zero-subject 
constructions and number, gender and 
syntactic differences. Our system improves 
other proposals presented so far due to the 
fact that we are able to solve and generate 
intersentential anaphora, to detect 
coreference chains and to generate Spanish 
zero-pronouns into English, issues that are 
hardly considered by other systems. Finally, 
we provide outstanding results of our system 
on unrestricted corpora. 
Introduction 
One of the main problems of many commercial 
Machine Translation (MT) and experimental 
systems is that they do not carry out a correct 
pronominal anaphora generation. Solving the 
anaphora nd extracting the antecedent are key 
issues in a correct generation into the target 
language. Unfortunately, the majority of MT 
systems do not deal with anaphora resolution 
and their successful operation usually does not 
go beyond the sentence l vel. In this paper, we 
present acomplete approach that allows pronoun 
resolution and generation into the target 
language. 
Our approach works on unrestricted texts 
unlike other systems, like the KANT interlingua 
system (Leavitt et al (1994)), that are designed 
for well-defined omains. Although full parsing 
of these texts could be applied, we have used 
partial parsing of the texts due to the 
unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar. 
This is a main difference with the majority of the 
interlingua systems such as the DLT system 
based on a modification of Esperanto (Witkam 
(1983)), the Rosetta system which is 
experimenting with Montague semantics as the 
basis for an interlingua (Appelo and 
Landsbergen (1986)), the KANT system, etc. as 
they use full parsing of the text. 
After the parsing and solving pronominal 
anaphora, an interlingua representation f the 
whole text is obtained. In the interlingua 
representation no semantic information is used 
as input, unlike some approaches that have as 
input semantic information of the constituents 
(Miyoshi et al (1997), Castell6n et al (1998), 
the DLT system, etc). 
From this interlingua representation, the 
generation of anaphora (including intersentential 
anaphora), the detection of coreference hains of 
the whole text and the generation of Spanish 
zero-pronouns into English have been carried 
out, issues that are hardly considered by other 
systems. Furthermore, this approach can be used 
for other different applications, e.g. Information 
Retrieval, Summarization, etc. 
The paper is organized as follows: In section 1, 
the complete approach that includes Analysis, 
Interlingua and Generation modules will be 
described. These modules will be explained in 
detail in the next three sections. In section 5, the 
Generation module has been evaluated in order 
! This paper has been partly financed by the collaborative r search project between Spain and The United Kingdom

to measure the efficiency of our proposal. To do 
so, two experiments have been accomplished: 
the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into 
English (syntactic generation module) and the 
generation of English pronouns into Spanish 
ones (morphological generation module). 
Finally, the conclusions of this work will be 
presented. 
1 System Architecture 
The complete approach that solves and generates 
the anaphor is based on the scheme of Figure 1. 
Translation is carried out in two stages: from the 
source language to the Interlingua, nd from the 
Interlingua into the target language. Modules for 
analysis are independent from modules for 
generation..In this paper, although we have only 
studied the Spanish and English languages, our 
approach is easily extended to other languages, 
i.e. multilingual system, in the sense that any 
analysis module can be linked to any generation 
module.

Figure 1. System architecture. 
As can be observed in Figure 1, there are 
three independent modules in the process of 
generation: Analysis, Interlingua nd Generation 
modules. 
2 Analysis module 
The analysis is carried out by means of SUPAR 
(Slot Unification Parser for Anaphora 
resolution) system, presented in Femindez et al 
(2000). SUPAR is a computational system 
focused on anaphora resolution. It can deal with 
several kinds of anaphora, such as pronominal 
anaphora, one-anaphora, surface-count anaphora 
and definite descriptions. In this paper, we focus 
on pronominal anaphora resolution and 
generation into the target language. In 
pronominal anaphora resolution in both the 
Spanish and English languages, the system has 
achieved an accuracy of 84% and 87% 
respectively. 
A grammar defined by means of the 
grammatical formalism SUG (Slot Unification 
Grammar) is used as input of SUPAR. A 
translator that transforms SUG rules into Prolog 
clauses has been developed. This translator will 
provide a Prolog program that will parse each 
sentence. SUPAR allows to carry out either a full 
or a partial parsing of the text, with the same 
parser and grammar. Here, partial parsing 
techniques have been used due to the 
unavoidable incompleteness of the grammar and 
the use of unrestricted texts (corpora) as inputs. 
These unrestricted corpora used as input for 
the partial parser contain the words tagged with 
their grammatical categories obtained from the 
output of a part-of-speech (POS) tagger. The 
word, as it appears in the corpus, its lemma nd 
its POS tag (with morphological information) is
supplied for each word in the corpus. The corpus 
is split into sentences before applying the 
parsing. 
The output of the parsing module will be 
the Slot Structure (SS) that stores the necessary 
information 2 for Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) problem resolution. This SS will be the 
input for the following module in which NLP 
problems (anaphora, extraposition, ellipsis, etc.) 
will be treated and solved. 
In Fernindez et al (1998), a partial parsing 3 
strategy that provides all the necessary 
information for resolving anaphora is presented. 
This partial parsing shows that only the 
following constituents are necessary for 
anaphora resolution: co-ordinated prepositional 
and noun phrases, pronouns, conjunctions and 
2 The SS stores for each constituent the following 
information: constituent name (NP, PP, etc.), 
semantic and morphologic information, discourse 
marker (identifier of the entity or discourse object) 
and the SS of its subconstituents. 
3 It is important to emphasize that he system allows 
to carry out a full parsing of the text. In this paper, 
partial parsing with no semantic nformation is used 
in the evaluation ofour approach. 
43 
verbs, regardless of the order in which they 
appear in the text. The free words consist of 
constituents hat are not covered by this partial 
parsing (e.g. adverbs). 
After applying the anaphora resolution 
module, a new Slot Structure (SS') is obtained. 
In this new structure the correct antecedent 
(chosen from the possible candidates) for each 
anaphoric expression will be stored together 
with its morphological and semantic 
information. SS' will be the input for the 
lnterlingua system. 
3 Interl ingua system (ISS) 
As said before, the Interlingua system takes the 
SS of the sentence after applying the anaphora 
resolution module as input. This system, named 
lnterlingua Slot Structure (1SS), generates an 
interlingua representation from the SS of the 
sentence. 
SUPAR generates one SS for each sentence 
from the whole text and it solves intrasentential 
and intersententiai anaphora. Then, 1SS 
generates the interlingua representation f the 
whole text. This is one of the main advantages 
of 1SS because it is possible to generate 
intersentential pronominal naphora. 
To begin with, 1SS splits sentences into 
clauses 4.To identify a new clause when partial 
parsing has been carried out, the following 
heuristic has been applied: 
H1 Let us assume that the beginning of a new 
clause has been found when a verb is parsed 
and a free conjunction is subsequently parsed. 
In this particular case, a free conjunction 
does not imply conjunctions that join co- 
ordinated noun and prepositional phrases. It 
refers, here, to conjunctions that are parsed in 
our partial parsing scheme. 
Once the text has been split into clauses, 
the next stage is to generate the interlingua 
representation for clauses. We have used a 
complex feature structure for each clause. In 
Figure 2 the information of the first clause of the 
example (1) is presented: 
(1) The boys of the mountains were in the 
garden. They were catching flowers. 
4 A clause could be defined as "a group of words 
containing a verb". 
( Verb: be "\] 
1Number: plural 1 
ACTION= .~ Person: third

Figure 2. lnterlingua representation fa clause. 
As can be observed in Figure 25 , the 
interlingua is a frame composed of semantic 
roles and features extracted from the SS of the 
clause. Semantic roles that have been used in 
this approach are the following: ACTION, 
AGENT, THEME and MODIFIER that 
correspond to verb, subject, object and 
prepositional phrases of the clause respectively. 
The notation we have used is based on the 
representation used in KANT interlingua. To 
identify these semantic roles when partial 
parsing has been carried out and no semantic 
knowledge is used, the following heuristic has 
been applied: 
H2 Let us assume that the NP parsed before 
the verb is the agent of the clause. In the same 
way, the NP parsed after the verb is the theme 
of the clause. Finally., all the PP found in the 
clause are its modifiers. 
5 Only the relevant attributes of each semantic role 
appear in a simplified way in the picture. Additional 
attributes are added to the semantic roles in order to 
complete all the necessary information for the 
interlingua representation. 
44 
In Figure 2 the following elements have 
been found: ACTION= 'were', AGENT = 'the 
boys of the mountains', THEME= ~ (it has not 
been found any NP after the verb) and 
MODIFIER = 'in the garden'. These elements 
are represented by a simple feature structure. 
Features are represented asattributes with their 
corresponding values. 
The semantic role ACTION has the 
following attributes: Verb with the value of the 
lemma of the verb; Number, Person and Tense 
(grammatical features) and Type with the type of 
the verb: impersonal, transitive, etc. 
'The semantic role AGENT has the 
following fiitributes: Cat that contains the 
syntactic ategory of the constituent; Identifier 
with the value of the discourse marker; Head 
that contains the lemma of the constituent's 
head; Number, Gender and Person contain 
grammatical features of the constituent; 
MODIFIER that contains all the information 
about he modifiers (PP) of the NP, and Sem_Ref 
that contains semantic information about the 
constituent's head if this information is 
available. The semantic role THEME has the 
same attributes as the semantic role AGENT, i.e. 
the difference is that THEME is the object of the 
clause and AGENT is the subject. 
Finally, the semantic role MODIFIER has 
the following attributes: Cat that contains the 
syntactic ategory of the constituent; Identifier 
with the value of the discourse marker; Prep 
with the preposition of the constituent and 
ENTITY, which is the object of the PP and 
contains the same attributes as the THEME. 
One clause can have more than one MODIFIER 
depending on the number of PP that it has. It is 
important to emphasize that all this information 
is extracted from the SS of the constituents 
parsed in the clause. 
As said before, instead of representing the 
clauses independently, we are interested in the 
interlingua representation of the whole input 
text. With the global representation f the input 
text we will be able to generate intrasentential 
and intersentential anaphora. Furthermore, it will 
be possible to solve and generate coreference 
chains. Thereby, the scheme of Figure 2 is 
extended in order to represent all the discourse 
using the clauses as main units of this 
representation. In Figure 3 the interlingua 
representation f the whole text of the example 
(1) can be observed.

Figure 3. Interlingua representation f 
example (1). 
On the left side of Figure 3 the new objects 
or entities of the discourse are represented. 
These objects are named ENTITIES and 
contain the following attributes: Cat, Identifier, 
Head, Number, Gender, Person and Sem_Ref, 
due to they can represent an AGENT, a 
THEME or an object in a MODIFIER. 
On the right side, the CLAUSES of the 
text are represented in a simplified way. They 
contain the semantic role. ACTION with its 
attributes and the semantic roles AGENT, 
THEME and MODIFIER that have appeared 
in the clause. These semantic roles are linked to 
the ENTITIES that they refer to. It also contains 
the identifier of the sentence in which the 
CLAUSE appears (Sentence lD) and the 
Conjunction that joints two or more CLAUSES 
in a sentence. 
45 
In the picture, four ENTITIES and two 
CLAUSES can be distinguished. The 
ENTITIES are as follows: ENTITY 1 ('boy'), 
ENTITY 2 ('mountain), ENTITY 3 ('garden') 
and ENTITY 4 ('flower'). Moreover, a relation 
between two ENTITIES (number 1and number 
2) appears in the picture due to the ENTITY1 
(NP) contains aMODIFIER (PP). 
The CLAUSE 1 contains: Sentence 1D 
(' 1 '), ACTION ('be'), AGENT ('V', the link to 
ENTITY 1) and MODIFIER (which is a PP 
and contains the link to ENTITY 3). The 
CLAUSE 2 contains: Sentence_lD ('2'), 
'ACTION ('catch'), AGENT (which is a 
PRONOUN and contains the link to ENTITY 1) 
and THEME ('Z', the link to ENTITY 4). 
The coreference chain can be identified 
thanks to AGENTS of CLAUSE 1 and 
CLAUSE 2 ('the boys' and 'they') have their 
links to the same ENTITY. As can be seen, 
these links can occur between constituents of 
different clauses or different sentences. Then, 
the global system is able to generate 
intersentential anaphora and identify the 
coreferenee chains of the text. 
4 Generation module 
The Generation module takes the interlingua 
representation f the text as input and generates 
it into the target language. In this paper, we are 
only describing the generation of pronouns. The 
generation phase is split into two modules: 
syntactic generation and morphological 
generation. In the next two subsections they will 
be studied in detail. Although the approach 
presented here is multilingual, we have focused 
on the generation i to the Spanish and English 
languages. 
4.1 Syntactic generation 
In syntactic generation the interlingua 
representation is converted by 'transformational 
rules' into an ordered surface-structure tr e, with 
appropriate labeling of the leaves with target 
language grammatical functions and features. 
The basic task of syntactic generation is to order 
constituents in the correct sequence for the target 
language. However, the aim of this work is only 
the generation of pronominal anaphora into the 
target language, so we have only focused on the 
differences between the Spanish and English 
languages in the generation of the pronoun. 
These differences are what we have named 
discrepancies (a study of Spanish-English- 
Spanish discrepancies is showed in Peral et aL 
(1999)). In syntactic generation the following 
discrepancies can be found: syntactic 
discrepancies and Spanish elliptical zero-subject 
constructions. 
4.1.1 Syntactic discrepancies 
This discrepancy is due to the fact that the 
surface structures of the Spanish sentences are 
more flexible than the English ones. The 
constituents of the Spanish sentences can appear 
without a specific order in the sentence. In order 
to carry out a correct generation i to English, we 
must firstly reorganize the Spanish sentence. 
Nevertheless, in the English-Spanish translation, 
in general, this reorganization is not necessary. 
Let us see an example with the Spanish 
sentence 
(2) A Pedro Io vi ayer. 
(I saw Peter yesterday.) 
In (2), the object of the verb, A Pedro (to 
Peter), appears before the verb (in the position 
of the theoretically subject) and the subject is 
omitted (this phenomena is usual in Spanish and 
it will be explained in the next subsection). The 
PP A Pedro (to Peter) functions as an indirect 
object of the verb (because it has the preposition 
A (to)). We can find out the subject since the 
verb is in first person and singular, so the subject 
would be the pronoun Yo (1). Moreover, there is 
a pronoun, lo (him) that functions as 
complement of the verb vi (saw). This pronoun 
in Spanish refers to the object of the verb, Peter, 
when it is moved from its theoretical place after 
the verb (as it occurs in this sentence). 
As explained before, it is possible to 
identify the semantic roles (AGENT, ACTION, 
etc.) of the previous constituents in the 
CLAUSE applying a series of heuristics. Once 
the semantic roles of the constituents have been 
established, they will be stored in the interlingua 
representation. The generation i to English will 
be a new clause in which the order of the 
constituents i the usual in English: AGENT, 
ACTION, THEME and MODIFIERS. 
46 
4.1.2 Elliptical zero-subject constructions 
(zero-pronouns) 
As commented before, the Spanish language 
allows to omit the pronominal subject of the 
sentences. These omitted pronouns are usually 
named zero-pronouns. While in other languages, 
zero-pronouns may appear in either the subject's 
or the object's grammatical position, (e.g. 
Japanese), in Spanish texts, zero-pronouns only 
appear in the position of the subject. In English 
texts, this sort of pronoun occurs far less 
frequently, as the use of them are generally 
compulsory in the language. Nevertheless, some 
examples can be found: "Ross carefully folded 
his trousers and ~.climbed into bed". (The 
symbol ~ shows the position of the omitted 
pronoun).. Target languages with typical 
elliptical (zero) constructions corresponding to
source English pronouns are Italian, Thai, 
Chinese or Japanese. 
In order to generate Spanish zero-pronouns 
into English, they must first be located in the 
text (ellipsis detection), and then resolved 
(anaphora resolution). At the ellipsis detection 
stage, information about the zero-pronoun (e.g. 
person, gender, and number) must first be 
obtained from the verb of the clause and then 
used to identify the antecedent of the zero- 
pronoun (resolution stage). The detection 
process depends on the knowledge about the 
structure of the language itself, which gives us 
clues to the use of each type of zero-pronoun. 
The resolution of zero-pronouns has been 
implemented in SUPAR. As we may work on 
unrestricted texts to which partial parsing is 
applied, zero-pronouns must also be detected 
when we do not dispose of full syntactic 
information. Once the input text has been split 
into clauses after applying the heuristic H1, the 
next problem consists of the detection of the 
omission of the subject from each clause. 
If partial parsing techniques have been 
applied, we can establish the following heuristic 
to detect he omission of the subject from each 
clause: 
H3 After the sentence has been divided into 
clauses, a noun phrase or a pronoun is sought, 
for each clause, through the clause constituents 
on the left-hand side of the verb, unless it is 
imperative or impersonal. Such a noun phrase 
or pronoun must agree in person and number 
with the verb of the clause. 
Sometimes, gender information of the 
pronoun can be obtained when the verb is 
copulative. For example, in: 
(3) Pedroj vio a Anak en el parque. Ok Estaba 
muy guapa. 
(Peterj saw Annk in the park. Shek was very 
beautiful.) 
In this example, the verb estaba (was) is 
copulative, so that its subject must agree in 
gender and number with its object whenever the 
object can have either a masculine or a feminine 
linguistic form (guapo: masc, guapa: fem). We 
can therefore get information about its gender 
from the object, guapa ("beautiful" in its 
feminine form) which automatically assigns it to 
the feminine gender so the omitted pronoun 
would have to be she rather than he. 
After the zero-pronoun has been detected, 
SUPAR inserts the pronoun (with its information 
of person, gender and number) in the position in 
which it has been omitted. This pronoun will be 
detected and resolved in the following module of 
anaphora resolution. After that, ISS generates the 
interlingua representation f the text. 
In the example (3), two CLAUSES are 
identified. In the second CLAUSE the zero- 
pronoun is detected (third person, singular and 
feminine -she-) and solved (third person, 
singular and feminine -Ann-). So the AGENT of 
this CLAUSE is the PRONOUN she and it has a 
link to the ENTITY Ann (the chosen 
antecedent). 
Now, the generation of Spanish zero- 
pronouns into English is easy because all the 
information that it is needed is located in the 
interlingua representatio.n. The English 
pronoun's information is extracted in the 
following way: number and person information 
are obtained from the PRONOUN and gender 
information is obtained from the Head of its 
antecedent. 
47 
4.2 Morphological generation 
In the morphological generation we mainly have 
to treat and solve number and gender 
discrepancies in the generation of pronouns. 
4.2.1 Number discrepancies 
This problem is generated by the discrepancy 
between words of different languages that 
express the same concept. These words can be 
referred to a singular pronoun in the source 
language and to a plural pronoun in the target 
language. For example, in English the concept 
.people is plural, whereas in Spanish is singular. 
(4) Tile stadium was full of peoplej. They~ were 
very angry withthe referee. 
(5) El estadio estaba /leno de gentei. ~stai 
estaba muy enfadada con el ~rbitro. 
In (4), it can be observed that the name 
people in English has been replaced with the 
plural pronoun they, whereas in Spanish (5) the 
name gente has been replaced with the singular 
pronoun dsta (it). Gender discrepancies also 
exist in the translation of other languages such 
as in the German-English translation. 
In order to take into account number 
discrepancies in the generation of the pronoun 
into the target language a set of morphological 
(number) rules is constructed. 
In the generation of the pronoun They into 
Spanish in the example (4), the interlingua 
representation has a PRONOUN ('they', third 
person and plural) that it is linked to the 
ENTITY ('police', plural). For the correct 
generation into Spanish the following 
morphological rule is constructed: 
pronoun + third..person + plural + antecedent 
(~olice') ~ ~sta (pronoun, third person, 
feminine and singular) 
The left-hand side of the morphological 
rule contains the interlingua representation of
the pronoun and the right-hand side contains the 
pronoun in the target language. 
In the same way, a set of morphological 
rules is constructed in order to generate English 
pronouns. Next, an example of these rules is 
shown: 
pronoun + third_person + singular + antecedent 
('policla~ ~ they (pronoun, third person and 
plural) 
4.2.2 Gender discrepancies 
English has less morphological information than 
Spanish. With reference to plural personal 
pronouns, the pronoun we can be translated into 
nosotros (masculine) or nosotras (feminine), you 
into ustedes (masculine/feminine), vosotros 
(masculine) or vosotras (feminine) and they into 
ellos or elias. Furthermore, the singular personal 
pronoun it can be translated into dl/dste 
(masculine) or ella/dsta (feminine). For 
example: 
(6) Women~ were in the shop. They~ were buying 
gifts for their husbands. 
(7) Las mujeresl estaban en la tienda. Ellasi 
estaban comprando regains pard sus maridos. 
In Spanish, the plural name mujeres 
(women) is feminine and is replaced by the 
personal pronoun elias (plural feminine) (7), 
whereas in English they is valid for masculine as 
well as for feminine (6). ", 
These discrepancies do not always mean 
that Spanish anaphors bear more information 
than English one. For example, Spanish 
possessive adjectives ~ casa) do not carry 
gender information whereas English possessive 
adjectives do (his~her house). 
We can find similar discrepancies among 
other languages. For example, in the 
French-German translation, gender is assigned 
arbitrarily in both languages (although in French 
is not as arbitrarily as in German). The English- 
German translation, like English-Spanish, 
supposes a translation from a language with 
neutral gender into a language that assigns 
gender grammatically. 
As commented, it is important to 
emphasize that the omission of the pronominal 
subject is very usual in Spanish. If we want to 
stress the subject of a clause or distinguish 
between different possible subjects, we will have 
to write the pronominal subject. Otherwise, 
pronominal subject could be omitted. We are 
interested, however, in the correct generation of 
pronouns, and therefore, they will never be 
omitted. 
Thanks to the fact that our system solves 
only personal pronouns in third person, we have 
only studied gender discrepancies in the 
generation of the third person pronouns. The 
48 
study has been divided into pronouns with 
subject role and pronouns with complement role. 
a) Pronouns with subject role. This kind of 
pronouns can be identified in the interlingua 
representation because they have the semantic 
role of AGENT in a CLAUSE. Their 
antecedents are established with the links to the 
ENTITIES. 
The main problem in the pronoun 
generation into English consists of the 
generation of pronoun it. If we have a pronoun 
with the following attributes: masculine, 
singular and third person in the interlingua 
representation, this can be generated into the 
Spanish pron6uns he or it. If the antecedent of
the pronoun refers to a person, we will generate 
it into he. If the antecedent of the pronoun is an 
animal or a thing we will generate it into it. 
These characteristics of the antecedent can be 
obtained from the semantic information stored in 
its attribute Sem_Ref. A similar strategy is used 
to generate the pronouns she or it. With 
reference to plural personal pronouns: 
masculine/feminine, plural and third person, 
they are generated into the English pronoun 
they. 
In Figure 4, the set of morphological rules 
to treat gender discrepancies in English 
generation of pronouns is shown: 
pron + third_person + masculine + sing + antec (person) ~ he 
pmn + thirdperson + masculine + sing + antec (animal or thing) --) it 
pron + thirdperson + feminine + sing + antec (person) ..-) she 
pron + third_person + feminine + sing + antec (animal orthing) ~ it 
pron + thitrlperson + feminine/masculine +plural ~ they 
Figure 4. 
In Spanish generation, the main problem 
consists of the translation of pronoun it The set 
of morphological rules to treat his case is shown 
in Figure 5: 
pron + third_person + sing + antec (animal with masculine gender) ~ ~1 
\[ pron + third_person + sing + antec (thing with masculine gender) .-) dste 
\] pron + third_person + sing + antec (animal with feminine gender) ~ ella 
l pmn + third_person + sing + antec (thing with feminine gender) .-y 6sta 
Figure 5. 
b) Pronouns with complement role. This kind of 
pronouns can be identified in the interlingua 
representation because they have the semantic 
role of THEME or they are in a MODIFIER in 
a CLAUSE. 
In the pronoun generation i to English, the 
set of morphological rules of Figure 6 is 
applied: 
pron + third_parson + sing + antec (person with masculine gander) ~ him 
pron + third_person + sing + antec (person with feminine gender) ~ her 
pron + third_person + sing + antec (animal orthing) ...) it 
pron ? thirdperson + plural + antec (person) ~ them

In the process of generating a pronoun with 
the semantic role of THEME into Spanish, the 
set of morphological rules of Figure 7 is 
applied: 
pron ? third_person ? plural ~ les 
Figure 7. 
On the other hand, if the pronoun is in a 
MODIFIER, the rules of Spanish generation 
will be as shown in Figure 8: 
pron + third_person + sing + antec (masculine gender) ~ ~1 
pron + third_person + sing + antec (feminine gender) ...) ella 
pron + third.person + plural + antec (masculine gender) ~ ellos 
pron + third_person + plural + antec (feminine gender) ~ elias

5 Evaluation 
The syntactic generation and morphological 
generation modules of our approach ave been 
evaluated. To do so, one experiment for each 
module has been accomplished. In the first one, 
the generation of Spanish zero-pronouns into 
English, using the techniques described above in 
subsection 4.1.2, has been evaluated 6. In the 
second one, the generation of English 
pronouns into Spanish ones has been evaluated. 
In this experiment number and gender 
discrepancies and their resolution, described 
above in section 4.2, have been taken into 
account. 
With reference to the first experiment, our 
computational system has been trained with a

49 
handmade corpus 7 that contains 106 zero- 
pronouns. With this training, we have extracted 
the degree of importance of the preferences that 
are used in the anaphora resolution module of 
the system. Furthermore, we have been able to 
check and correct the techniques used in the 
detection and generation of zero-pronouns into 
English. After that, we have carried out a blind 
evaluation on unrestricted texts using the set of 
preferences and the generation techniques 
learned during the training phase. In this case, 
partial parsing of the text with no semantic 
information has been used. 
With regard to unrestricted texts, our 
system has been run on two different Spanish 
corpora: a) a fragment of the Spanish version of 
The Blue Book corpus (15,571 words), which 
contains the handbook of the International 
Telecommunications Union CCITT, and b) a 
fragment of the Lexesp corpus (9,746 words), 
which contains ten Spanish texts from different 
genres and authors. These texts are taken mainly 
from newspapers. These corpora have been 
POS-tagged. Having worked with different 
genres and disparate authors, we feel that the 
applicability of our proposal to other sorts of 
texts is assured. 
To evaluate the generation of Spanish zero- 
pronouns into English three tasks have been 
accomplished: a) the evaluation of the detection 
of zero-pronouns, b) the evaluation of anaphora 
resolution and c) the evaluation of generation. 
a) Evaluating the detection of zero-pronouns. 
To do this, verbs have been classified into 
two categories: 1) verbs whose subjects 
have been omitted, and 2) verbs whose 
subjects have not. We have obtained a 
success rate s of 88% on 1,599 classified 
verbs, with no significant differences seen 
between the corpora. We should also 
remark that a success rate of 98% has been 
obtained in the detection of verbs whose 
subjects were omitted, whereas only 80% 
was achieved for verbs whose subjects 
were not. This lower success rate is

verbs in the text. 
justified for several reasons. One important 
reason is the non-detection of impersonal 
verbs by the POS tagger. Two other 
reasons are. the lack of semantic 
information and the inaccuracy of the 
grammar used. It is important to note that 
46% of the verbs in these corpora have 
their subjects omitted. It shows quite 
clearly the importance of this phenomenon 
in Spanish. 
b) Evaluating anaphora resolution. In this 
task, the evaluation of zero-pronoun 
resolution is accomplished. Of the 1,599 
verbs classified in these two corpora, 734 
of them have zero-pronouns. Only 228 of 
them 9, however, are in third person and will 
be anaphorically resolved. A success rate of 
75% was attained for the 228 zero- 
pronouns. By "successful resolutions" we 
mean that the solutions offered by our 
system agree with the solutions offered by 
two human experts. 
c) Evaluating zero-pronoun generation. The 
generation of the 228 Spanish zero- 
pronouns into English has been evaluated. 
The following results in the generation 
have been obtained: a success rate of 70% 
in Lexesp and a success rate of 899'o in The 
Blue Book. In general (both corpora) a 
success rate of 75% has been achieved. The 
errors are mainly produced by fails in 
anaphora resolution and fails in the 
generation of pronouns he/she/it (some 
heuristics 10, which have failed sometimes, 
have been applied due to the used corpora 
do not include semantic information). 
In the second experiment, we have 
evaluated the generation of Spanish personal 
pronouns with subject role into the English ones. 
A fragment of the English version of The Blue 
Book corpus (70,319 words) containing 165 
9 The remaining pronouns are not in third person or 
they are cataphoric (the antecedent appears after the 
anaphor) or exophoric (the antecedent does not 
appear, linguistically, inthe text). 
J0 For instance: "all the pronouns in third person and 
singular whose antecedents are proper nouns have 
boon translated into he (antecedent with masculine 
gender) or she (antecedent with feminine gender); 
otherwise they have been translated into it". 
50 
pronouns with subject role has been used in 
order to carry out a blind evaluation. A success 
rate of 85.41% has been achieved. The errors are 
mainly produced by fails in anaphora resolution 
and in the correct choice of the gender of the 
antecedent's Head in Spanish. With reference to 
the choice of the gender of the antecedent's 
Head, an electronic dictionary has been used in 
order to translate the original English word into 
the Spanish one, and subsequently, the gender is 
extracted from the Spanish word. Several 
problems have occurred when using this 
electronic dictionary: 
1) ' the word to be translated does not appear in 
the dic-tionary, and therefore, a heuristic is 
applied to assign the gender 
2) the correct sense of the English word is not 
chosen, and therefore, the gender could be 
assigned incorrectly. 
Conclusion 
In this paper a complete approach to solve and 
generate pronominal anaphora in the Spanish 
and English languages is presented. The 
approach works on unrestricted texts to which 
partial parsing techniques have been applied. 
After the parsing and solving pronominal 
anaphora, an interlingua representation (based 
on semantic roles and features) of the whole text 
is obtained. The representation f the whole text 
is one of the main advantages of our system due 
to several problems, that are hardly solved by 
the majority of MT systems, can be treated and 
solved. These problems are the generation of 
intersentential anaphora, the detection of 
coreference hains and the generation of Spanish 
zero-pronouns into English. Generation of zero- 
pronouns and Spanish personal pronouns has 
been evaluated obtaining a success rate of 75% 
and 85.41% respectively.
