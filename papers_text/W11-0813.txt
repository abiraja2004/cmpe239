Abstract
The identification and extraction of Multiword
Expressions (MWEs) currently deliver satis-
factory results. However, the integration of
these results into a wider application remains
an issue. This is mainly due to the fact that
the association measures (AMs) used to detect
MWEs require a critical amount of data and
that the MWE dictionaries cannot account for
all the lexical and syntactic variations inherent
in MWEs. In this study, we use an alterna-
tive technique to overcome these limitations. It
consists in defining an n-gram frequency data-
base that can be used to compute AMs on-the-
fly, allowing the extraction procedure to effi-
ciently process all the MWEs in a text, even if
they have not been previously observed.
1 Introduction
Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are commonly
defined as ?recurrent combinations of words that
co-occur more often than expected by chance and
that correspond to arbitrary word usages? (Smadja,
1993, 143). Their importance in the field of natu-
ral language processing (NLP) is undeniable. Al-
though composed of several words, these sequences
are nonetheless considered as simple units with re-
gard to part-of-speech at the lexical as well as syn-
tactic levels. Their identification is therefore essen-
tial to the efficiency of applications such as parsing
(Nivre and Nilsson, 2004), machine translation (Ren
et al, 2009), information extraction, or information
retrieval (Vechtomova, 2005). In these systems, the
principle of syntactic or semantic/informational unit
is particularly important.
Although the identification and extraction of
MWEs now deliver satisfactory results (Evert and
Krenn, 2001; Pearce, 2002), their integration into
a broader applicative context remains problematic
(Sag et al, 2001). The explanations for this situation
are twofold.
1. The most effective extraction methods resort
to statistical association measures based on the
frequency of lexical structures. They, therefore,
require a critical amount of data and cannot
function properly from a simple phrase or even
from a short text.
2. Since the syntactic and lexical variability of
MWEs may be high, lexical resources learned
from a corpus cannot take it into account. The
coverage of these resources is indeed too limi-
ted when applied to a new text.
To address these two limitations, this article des-
cribes how an n-gram frequency database can be
used to compute association measures (AMs) effi-
ciently, even for small texts. The specificity of this
new technique is that AMs are computed on-the-fly,
freeing it from the coverage limitation that afflicts
more simple techniques based on a dictionary.
We start off focussing on our extraction method,
and more particularly on the process via which a
candidate structure is statistically validated (Section
2). This presentation principally aims to identify
the precise needs of a frequency database reference,
both in terms of the interrogation process and in the
type of information to be kept in the database. Then,
we will address various issues of storage and query
performance raised by the design of the frequency
83
database (Section 3). Finally, Section 4 reports the
results of our experiments and Section 5 concludes
and open up future perspectives.
2 Extraction process
Our extraction procedure is comparable to those
developed by Smadja (1993) and Daille (1995).
They use a linguistic filter upstream of the statisti-
cal estimation. Unlike purely statistical techniques,
this solution provides less coverage but greater ac-
curacy. It also allows us to assign a unique morpho-
syntactic category to each extracted unit (as well as
a description of its internal structure), which facili-
tates its integration into a more complex procedure.
Concretely, we first tagged the texts to clear any
lexical ambiguities 1. We then identified all MWE
candidates in the tagged text with the help of a li-
brary of transducers 2 (or syntactic patterns). Finally,
the list of candidates was submitted to the statistical
validation module which assigns an AM to each of
these.
2.1 Linguistic filters
In this study, we consider four basic types of
nominal structures 3 : adjective-noun (AN), noun-
adjective (NA), noun-preposition-noun (N prepN),
and noun-noun (NN), which are likely to undergo
three types of variations : modification (mainly ad-
verbial insertion and / or adjectival), coordination,
and juxtaposition (e.g. N prepN prepN, N prepNN,
etc). This enables us to identify a wide variety of
sequences that are labelled by XML tags which spe-
cify :
? the lexical heads of the various components ;
? the adjectival and prepositional dependencies ;
? any possible coordination.
This information can be exploited later to carry out
the syntactic decomposition of the extracted struc-
tures and also to limit the statistical validation to the
content words of each structure.
1. The tagging is done with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
2. To apply our transducers to the tagged text, we use Unitex
(Paumier, 2003). The output of the process is a file containing
only the recognized sequences.
3. As we work in the field of indexation, we limit our ex-
traction to nominal terms.
2.2 Statistical validation
Association measures are conventionally used
to automatically determine whether an extracted
phrase is an MWE or not. They are mathematical
functions that aim to capture the degree of cohesion
or association between the constituents. The most
frequently used measures are the log-likelihood ratio
(Dunning, 1993), the mutual information (Church
and Hanks, 1990) or the ?2 (Church and Gale, 1991),
although up to 82 measures have been considered by
Pecina and Schlesinger (2006). In this paper, we did
not aim to compare AMs, but simply to select some
effective ones in order to evaluate the relevance of a
reference for MWE extraction.
However, association measures present two main
shortcomings that were troublesome for us : they are
designed for bigrams, although longer MWEs are
quite frequent in any corpus 4, and they require the
definition of a threshold above which an extracted
phrase is considered as an MWE. The first aspect is
very limiting when dealing with real data where lon-
ger units are common. The second may be dealt with
some experimental process to obtain the optimal va-
lue for a given dataset, but is prone to generalization
problems. In the next two sections, we present the
strategies we have used to overcome these two limi-
tations.
2.2.1 Beyond bigrams
A common way to go beyond the bigram limita-
tion is to compute the AMs at the bigram level and
then use the results as input for the computation of
higher order AMs (Seretan et al, 2003). However,
our preliminary experimentations have yielded un-
satisfactory results for this technique when it is ap-
plied to all words and not to heads only. This is pro-
bably a side effect of high frequency bigrams such
as preposition-determiner (prep det) in French.
Another strategy explored by Silva and
Lopes (1999) is the fair dispersion point normaliza-
tion. For a given n-gram, which has n?1 dispersion
points that define n ? 1 "pseudo-bigrams", they
compute the arithmetic mean of the probabilities of
the various combinations rather than attempting to
pick up the right point. This technique enables the

3714 are longer than the bigrams.
84
authors to generalize various conventional measures
beyond the bigram level. Among these, we selected
the fair log-likelihood ratio as the second AM for
our experiments (see Equation 1), given that the
classic log-likelihood ratio has been found to be
one of the best measures (Dunning, 1993; Evert and
Krenn, 2001).
LogLik f (w1 ? ? ?wn) = 2? logL(p f 1,k f 1,n f 1)
+ logL(p f 2,k f 2,n f 2)
? logL(p f ,k f 1,n f 1)
? logL(p f ,k f 2,n f 2) (1)
where
k f 1 = f (w1 ? ? ?wn) n f 1 = Avy
k f 2 = Avx? k f 1 n f 2 = N ?n f 1
Avx = 1

p f = k f 1+k f 2N p f 1 = k f 1n f 1 p f 2 = k f 2n f 2
and N is the number of n-grams in the corpus.
Silva and Lopes (1999) also suggested an AM of
their own : the Symmetrical Conditional Probabi-
lity, which corresponds to P(w1|w2)P(w2|w1) for a
bigram. They defined the fair dispersion point nor-
malization to extend it to larger n-grams, as shown
in Equation 2.
SCPf ([w1 ? ? ?wn]) =
p(w1 ? ? ?wn)2
Avp
(2)
where w1 ? ? ?wn is the n-gram considered and Avp is
defined as follows :
Avp = 1
n?1
i=n?1
?
i=1
p(w1 ? ? ?wi)? p(wi+1 ? ? ?wn) (3)
Finally, we considered a last AM : the Mutual Ex-
pectation (Dias et al, 1999) (see Equation 4). Its
specificity lies in its ability to take into account non-
contiguous MWEs such as ?to take __ decision? or
?a __ number of?, which can also be realized using
the heads (see above).
ME(w1 ? ? ?wn) =
f (w1 ? ? ?wn)? p(w1 ? ? ?wn)

(4)
where FPE is defined as follows :
FPE = 1
n
[p(w2 ? ? ?wn)+
n
?
i=2
p(w1 ? ? ? w?i ? ? ?wn)] (5)
It should be noted that the expression w1 ? ? ? w?i ? ? ?wn,
where the ? indicates an omitted term, represents all
the n (n-1)-grams the candidate MWE comprises.
FPE is then able to estimate the ?glue? between
all the constituents separated by a gap, but this ne-
vertheless requires a more complex string matching
process.
To summarize, we have selected the three follo-
wing association measures for n-grams : the fair log-
likelihood ratio, SCPf , and ME. Their efficiency is
further discussed in Section 4.
2.2.2 Selection of MWEs
The second problem that arises when one wants to
locate all the MWEs in a given text is the classifica-
tion criterion. For the log-likelihood ratio, which fol-
lows a chi-square distribution once it is transformed
as ?2? log?, a first solution is to base the decision
on the p-value. However, significance tests become
highly unreliable for large corpora, since the high
frequencies produce high scores for the chi-square
and all phenomena then appear significant (Kilgar-
riff, 2005).
A second technique commonly used in the MWE
literature is to select a threshold for the AM above
which an analyzed phrase is considered as an MWE.
Again, this threshold depends on the size of the cor-
pus used and cannot be fixed once and for all for
a specific AM. It must be obtained empirically for
each application of an MWE extractor to a new text
or to a new domain. In order not to resort to a thres-
hold, (Silva et al, 1999) suggested the LocalMax al-
gorithm that selects MWEs whose AMs are higher
than those of their neighborhood. In other words, a
given unit is classified as an MWE if g(w1 ? ? ?wn),
the associative function, is a local maximum.
In our case, since the notion of reference implies
a large corpus and high frequencies, we rejected
the first of these three approaches. We experimen-
ted with the second and third and show in Section 5
how the use of a reference could partially solve the
threshold issues.

3 Reference Building
The integration of MWEs in an NLP system is
usually done via a dictionary. MWEs are then re-
garded as a sequence of simple words separated by
spaces (Sag et al, 2001). As a result, their lexical
and syntactic structure is fixed and cannot be used
to take into account variation at this level.
Several methods have been proposed to overcome
this limitation. Nerima et al (2006) and Sag et
al. (2001) associate each MWE with a feature struc-
ture specifying the nature of units and the type of
fixedness. This approach requires a manual valida-
tion of the features when inserting them into the
dictionary. Watrin (2007) considers a simpler tech-
nique that consists in identifying, for each type of
structure, all the possible insertion points and spe-
cifying the lexical and syntactic nature of possible
modifiers. In this case, each MWE takes the form of
a regular expression formalizing all possible varia-
tions from the canonical form.
Both solutions enable to consider more MWEs
but fail to express all possible variations. For ins-
tance, phenomena such as coordination or juxta-
position do not seem to be taken into account by
the authors mentioned above including Nerima et
al. (2006). Moreover, they limit lexical variations to
a finite set of canonical structures that have been en-
countered and are therefore unable to recognize new
candidates.
The notion of reference which we define in this
article aims to overcome these two limitations. Ra-
ther than providing a list of MWEs that are pre-
computed on a corpus, we suggest storing the in-
formation needed to calculate various AMs within
a database. Hence, we no longer restrict MWEs to
a finite set of lexical entries but allow the on-the-fly
computation of AMs for any MWE candidate, wha-
tever the size of the input text.
3.1 Implementation details
From a computational point of view, this idea in-
volves the compression of a large number of lexi-
cal structures of order N as well as their absolute
frequency. Moreover, the calculation of the various
AMs considered in this study also requires the fre-
quencies of all structures of order n, strictly lower
than N (0 < n < N). The second type of informa-
tion can however be inferred from the frequency of
the structures of order N, provided the storage and
questioning system is efficient enough for real-time
applications. The need for efficiency also applies to
queries related to the ME measure or the LocalMax
algorithm that partly involve the use of wildcards.
This type of search tool can be efficiently im-
plemented with a PATRICIA tree (Morrison, 1968).
This data structure enables the compression of n-
grams that share a common prefix and of the nodes
that have only one child. The latter compression is
even more effective as most of the n-grams have a
unique suffix (Sekine, 2008). Beyond the compres-
sion that this structure allows, it also guarantees a
very fast access to data insofar as a query is a simple
tree traversal that can be done in constant time.
In order to further optimize the final data struc-
ture, we store the vocabulary in a table and associate
an integer as a unique identifier for every word. In
this way, we avoid the word repetition (whose size
in memory far exceeds that of an integer) in the tree.
Moreover, this technique also enables to speed up
the query mechanism, since the keys are smaller.
We derived two different implementations of this
structure. The first stores the data directly in me-
mory. While it enables easy access to data, the num-
ber of n-grams that can be stored is limited by the
capacity of the RAM. Therefore, in order to take a
huge number of n-grams into account, we also im-
plemented a ?disk? version of the tree.
Finally, in order to treat wildcard queries nee-
ded by the ME and the LocalMax, we enhanced our
structure with a set of indexes to improve access to
each word, whatever its depth within the tree. Ob-
viously, this mechanism might not be robust enough
for a system multiplying the number of wildcards,
but it is perfectly suited to the needs of an MWEs
extraction process.
3.2 References used
Once the computational aspects of reference buil-
ding have been dealt with, a corpus from which to
populate the database needs to be selected. This as-
pect raises two issues : the size and the nature of the
corpus used. Dunning (1993) has demonstrated that
the size of the corpus from which MWEs are extrac-
ted matters. On the other hand, common characteris-
tics of a corpus, such as its register, the contempora-

neity of its language or the nature of the topics co-
vered, may impact the performances of a reference
when used on a text with different characteristics.
Given these issues, four corpora were selected (cf.
Table 1). The first three are made up of articles pu-
blished in the Belgian daily newspaper Le Soir in
2009, with 500K, 1000K and 5000K words respec-
tively. They share many characteristics with our test
corpus. The last corpus is made up of the largest
amount of n-grams publicly available for French :
the Google 5-grams 5 (Michel et al, 2011). Its size
reaches 1T words 6, and its coverage in terms of to-
pic and register is supposedly wider than corpora of
newspaper articles only. In a sense, the Google re-
ference may be viewed as an attempt to a universal
reference.
4 Evaluation
Most evaluations of MWE extraction systems are
based on human judgments and restrict the valida-
tion process to the n-best candidates. Inevitably par-
tial, this method is unable to estimate performance
in terms of recall. To overcome these limitations,
we use the evaluation method described by Evert
and Krenn (2001). They propose an automatic me-
thod that consists in computing both recall and pre-
cision using various n-best samples. It involves the
formation of a golden standard (i.e. a list of MWEs
manually identified in a corpus) and a sorted list of
MWEs extracted automatically by applying AM on
the same corpus. The recall and precision rates are
therefore calculated by comparing the n-best (where
n increases from 0 till n in steps of x) to the golden
5. For the purposes of comparison, we also limited the size
of the n-grams indexed in Le Soir to 5 words.
6. In order to model a contemporary language, we only kept
the frequencies observed in texts written between 2000 and
2008.
standard list 7.
4.1 The test corpus
In this study, we use the corpus described in La-
porte et al (2006). It is a French corpus in which all
MWEs have been manually annotated. It consists of
two sub-corpora :
? the transcription, in a written style, of the Oc-
tober 3rd and 4th, 2006 meetings of the French
National Assembly (FNA), and
? the complete text of Jules Verne?s novel
"Around the World in 80 Days", published in
1873 (JV).
These two sub-corpora respectively contain 98,969
and 69,877 words for a total of 3,951 and 1,103
MWEs 8. We limit our evaluation to the FNA cor-
pus in order to keep data consistent both in terms
of register and time. We assume that these two va-
riables have a direct impact on the use of MWEs, a
hypothesis that seems to be confirmed by the rate of
MWEs in both sub-corpora.
4.2 Extractor Parameters
Before evaluating the performance of each of the
above mentioned references, we first assessed the in-
fluence of the various parameters involved in the ex-
traction process and which affect the performance
of the AMs. These parameters are the LocalMax,
the smoothing technique, the lemmatization of the
MWE constituents (LEMMA) 9 and the head-driven
validation (HDV) 10. To select the optimal parame-
ters for our extractor, we established an additional
reference (1000K words from Le Soir).
7. We build these lists from MWE types to avoid introdu-
cing a bias in the evaluation process. Well-recognised high fre-
quency MWEs might indeed gloss over poorly recognised low-
frequency MWEs.
8. These occurrences correspond to 1,384 MWE types for
the FNA corpus and 521 for the JV corpus.
9. The lemmatization of the MWE constituents is based on
the assumption that the inflexion of the lemmas implies a dis-
persal of the frequency mass (the overall frequency of a lemma
is split between its inflected forms) that may affect the behavior
of the AMs.
10. The HDV aims to focus on the lexical heads of the MWE
candidates. Therefore, function words (prepositions, conjunc-
tions, etc.) are ignored and replaced by wildcards in the queries
sent to the reference in order to keep the distance information.
For instance, from the sequence ministre de l?agriculture (Mi-
nister for Agriculture), we derive the form ministre * * agricul-
ture.

FIGURE 1: Evaluation of AMs
The first step of this selection procedure was to
define a baseline. For this purpose, we compared
the precision and recall rates of our three AMs (see
Figure 1) and kept only the best, namely the log-
likelihood ratio, for the rest of our experiments.
While the ME provides better precision for the top
five percent of the extracted units, the log-likelihood
ratio appears more reliable in that it maintains its
efficiency over time (for recall as well as precision).
The SCP, for its part, displays more stable results but
does not reach sufficient precision.
On the basis of this baseline, we then separately
compared the contribution of each of the four para-
meters. Results are reported in Figure 2 and detailed
in the following subsections.
4.2.1 The LocalMax
Figure 2 shows that the LocalMax significantly
improves the precision of the extraction. It emerges
as the most relevant parameter at this level. Howe-

ver, unlike other parameters, its application directly
affects the recall that falls below our baseline. This
may not be a problem for certain applications. In our
case, we aim to index and classify documents. The-
refore, while we can accommodate a lower preci-
sion, we cannot entirely neglect the recall. We thus
abandoned this parameter which, moreover, indubi-
tably increases the processing time in that it requires
the use of approximate matching (see Section 3.1).
4.2.2 The Add-text smoothing
Smoothing is another aspect worthy of considera-
tion. No matter how large the reference used is, it
will never constitute more than a subset of the lan-
guage. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution
to estimate the frequency of unobserved n-grams.
For the baseline, we used a simple "add-one? (or
Laplace) smoothing (Manning and Sch?tze, 1999)
which presents a severe flaw when the size of the n-
grams to smooth increases : the normalization pro-
88
cess discounts too much probability mass from ob-
served events.
We therefore compare this simple method with
another one we consider more ?natural? : the ?add-
text? smoothing that adds the text to process to the
reference. We view this method as more natural to
the extent that it simulates a standard MWE extrac-
tion process. In this case, the reference complements
the frequency universe of the input corpus as if it for-
med a homogeneous whole. Figure 2 demonstrates a
clear superiority of the second smoothing procedure
over the first one which was therefore discarded.
4.2.3 Lemmatization and HDV
The lemmatization and HDV follow a similar
curve with regard to precision, although HDV is bet-
ter for recall. Nonetheless, this difference only ap-
pears when precision falls below 35%. This does
not seem sufficient to reject the lemmatization pro-
cess whose computation time is significantly lower
than for the HDV. We therefore limit the use of this
last parameter to the reference built from Google
whose n-grams cannot be lemmatized due to lack of
context. 11
4.3 Evaluation of the references
The estimation of the parameters allowed us to es-
tablish a specific evaluation framework. Two sets of
parameters were defined depending on whether they
apply to Google (ATS + HDV) or to the references
built from Le Soir (ATS + LEMMA). From a prac-
tical standpoint, we limited the MWE extraction to
nominal units of size inferior to five in order to meet
the characteristics of our test corpus (the annotations
of which are limited to nominal sequences), on the
one hand, and to allow comparability of results on
the other hand (the n-grams from Google do not ex-
ceed the order 5).
Initially, we considered the extraction of MWEs
in the whole evaluation corpus. Results displayed in
Figure 3 provide an advantage over the use of a refe-
rence with respect to the extraction carried out on the
test corpus only. In addition, we see a clear improve-
ment in performance with respect to that obtainable
with a dictionary of MWEs. 12

FIGURE 3: Evaluation on the 100K Corpus
In a second step, we wanted to test the efficiency
of our references in the more adverse context of a
short text. We randomly selected 3K words of our
test corpus to simulate a short text while maintai-
ning a sufficient number of MWEs (i.e. 151 nominal
MWEs). Results shown in Figure 4 further confirm
our first experience and validate our concept of a re-
ference in a real application context.
Beyond validating the use of a frequency base,
these results also confirm the general idea that the
size of the corpus used for the reference matters. The
differences between the references of 500K, 1000K
and 5000K words showed a continuous improve-
ment both in precision and recall. The results obtai-
ned with the Google reference are more surprising,
since they do not meet that growing trend. Howe-
ver, given the number of errors that those n-grams

zation processes), the result remains satisfactory. It
even confirms to some extent the importance of size
in the sense that preprocessing errors are being miti-
gated by the global mass of the frequencies.
5 Conclusion and perspectives
In this paper, we presented an MWE extraction
system based on the use of frequency references. We
have shown that its use enables MWE extraction on
short texts with performances that are at least com-
parable to those achieved by standard solutions and
far superior to solutions based on the use of MWE
dictionaries.
Moreover, as this system has been integrated wi-
thin an indexing engine, various issues were rai-
sed, some of which constitute avenues for future re-
search. First, since our indexer aims at the identifi-
cation of entities and terms specific to a given spe-
cialty area, the question of data representativeness
is of particular importance. It is not clear to what

extent a given reference can be applied to various
types of texts. We only noticed that the Google refe-
rence, whose features were less similar to the test
corpus, nevertheless yielded satisfactory results in
comparison with our other references that better fit-
ted the test corpus features.
In addition, our results show that the threshold is-
sue remains relevant. Although the LocalMax seems
to allow better discrimination of the MWE candi-
dates, it is not selective enough to keep only the ac-
tual MWEs. On the other hand, as the size of the
references increases, some results of the AMs based
on the log-likelihood ratio reach high values that can
no longer be interpreted by a chi-square significance
test (see Table 2).
We believe that our references offer an interes-
ting perspective to face this problem. The stability of
their frequencies makes it possible to define a thre-
shold corresponding to a specific percentage of pre-
cision and recall (set according to the needs of a gi-
ven application). Therefore, as long as the size of
the analyzed texts remains limited ? which can be
controlled ?, the efficiency of this threshold should
remain constant. Further experimentations on this
aspect are however required to determine to what
extent this assumption stands true as the size of the
analyzed texts grows.
