Abstract 
Chinese Named entity recognition is one of 
the most important tasks in NLP. Two 
kinds of Challenges we confront are how to 
improve the performance in one corpus and 
keep its performance in another different 
corpus. We use a combination of statistical 
models, i.e. a language model to recognize 
person names and two CRFs models to 
recognize Location names and 
Organization names respectively. We also 
incorporate an efficient heuristic named 
entity list searching process into the 
framework of statistical model in order to 
improve both the performance and the 
adaptability of the statistical NER system. 
We participate in the NER tests on open 
tracks of MSRA. The testing results show 
that our system can performs well. 
1 Introduction 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the 
most important tasks in NLP, and acts as a critical 
role in some language processing applications, 
such as Information Extraction and Integration, 
Text Classification etc. Many efforts have been 
paid to improve the performance of NER. 
NER task in Chinese has some differences from 
in English as follows. 1) There is no space between 
Chinese characters, which make boundary 
recognition more difficult. 2) In English, a 
capitalized letter at the beginning position of a 
word implies that the word is a part of a named 
entity. However, this kind of characteristic does 
not exist in Chinese. 
In the paper, we will focus on two kinds of 
problems. 1) How to improve the performance of 
Chinese NER in one corpus, which contains 
boosting precision rate, recall rate and F-measure 
rate. 2) How to enhance the  adaptability of a 
Chinese NER system, which means that a system 
can get a good performance on a testing set which 
has many differences from the training set. To 
solve the first problem, we should select a good 
model and adjust parameters carefully. But there is 
no framework that can solve the second problem 
completely.  
Our goal is to find a way to solve these two 
problems. We select a language model to recognize 
Person names, and two CRFs models are used to 
recognize Location and Organization separately.  
We also try to incorporate a large-scale named 
entity list into the statistical model, where a 
heuristic searching method is developed to match 
the entities in the list quickly and efficiently. 
2 Framework of NER System 
The Input of the system is a raw text. We will 
apply some pre-processing such as code 
transformation. Then the heuristic searching will 
be executed to find the appearance of the entities in 
the named entity list. After that, two CRFs that 
have been trained before will be used to recognize 
Location and Organization based on the result of 
word segmentation, and a language model will be 
used to find Person names. All the results will be 
integrated at last.

3 System Details 
3.1 Using heuristic method to search entity 
list 
NER task meets many difficulties which come 
from the complexity of the construction of named 
entities. Named entities have flexible internal 
styles and external environments. Building a good 
model to describe the condition precisely will have 
many troubles. The statistical models we common-
ly used have some shortcomings, especially when 
they are adapted to a corpus of new domains or 
styles. We try to use an improved searching 
method to make up the relatively poor adaptability 
of the statistical models. The heuristic searching 
method is more flexible especially in the following 
two aspects. 1) Abbreviation can be matched. 2) 
Suffix in location and organization is universal, but 
it should not be taken in count when we search 
named entities. 
The framework of the algorithm can be briefly 
described as follows: 
 
1) Building an inverse index using Chinese characters 
as key term; 
2) Using the text as a query to search for entities; 
3) When comes terminal condition, a heuristic 
function is invoked to determine whether the 
character sequence is an entity; 
4) When comes creation condition, a heuristic 
function is invoked to judge whether a new entity is 
created; 
5) The labeled sequence is output. 
Table 1. Heuristic Searching Method 
One advantage of heuristic searching method is 
that the heuristic function can be set to fit a special 
corpus. The heuristic searching method we used in 
Bakeoff-4 is as follows:  
Un-segmenting test 
Person recognition 
Heuristic searching 
Location 
recognition 
Organization 
recognition 
Word segmentation 
Output results 
z Ignoring the suffix key word in Location and 
Organization names. For example 
??? ??/Tongfang /Corporation? and 
???/Tongfang? will get same score under 
this heuristic rule. 
z Ignoring the Location name as a prefix in an 
Organization name. For example, 
???/Ameri ??can /General Motors ? and 
???/General Motors? will get same score 
under this heuristic rule 
z Taking Abbreviation rules in consideration. 
For example??? ??/Peking /University? 
can be abbreviated as ?? ?/Bei /Da? rather 
than ???/Peking? or ???/University? 
Heuristic searching method also has such advan-
tages as follows: 
It is easy to be expanded to a corpus of new 
domain or style. We only need to add the entities 
in the new domain into list 
Searching method will improve the recall 
performance remarkably 
But the precision will be reduced for the ambi-
guities, i.e. whether a sequence that matches an 
entity in the list really constructs an entity in the 
text. We will disambiguate it using statistical 
models. 
3.2 Conditional Random Fields Model 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is an 
undirected graphical model that encodes a 
conditional probability distribution using a given 
set of features. Currently it is widely used as a 
discriminate model for sequence labeling:

( | ) exp( ( , , ))
k
i i c c
c C i
P Y X f y y X
Z
?
? =
= ??     (1) 
CRFs is considered to be a very effective model 
to resolve the issue of sequence labeling for the 
following characteristics: 
Because it uses a non-greedy whole sentence 
joint labeling method, high accuracy rate can be 
guaranteed and bias labeling can be avoided. 
Any types of features can be integrated in the 
model flexibly. 
Over-fitting can be avoided to some extent by 
integrating a priori with training data. 
172
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
As a discriminate model, CRFs inherits the 
advantages of both Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
and Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) 
as well. 
3.3 Person names recognize 
We use language model to recognize Personal 
names. We use character-based rather than word-
based model to avoid the word segmentation errors. 
We construct a context model and an entity model 
to respectively describe external and internal 
features of Personal names. The details of the 
model are as follows: 
We use a tri-gram model as the context model: 
( ) ( )? --?
m

1i2ii wcwc|wcPWCP

               (2) 
Entity model:

Where B means the beginning of the entity, M 
means middle, E means end. 
Some expert knowledge is employed to assist 
the recognition process of language model. 
z A Chinese family name list (476) and a 
Japanese family name list (9189) are used to 
restrict and select the generated candidates. 
z A list of commonly used character in Russian 
and European name. 
z Constrain of name length: A Chinese name 
cannot contain more than 8 characters. 
3.4 Location names recognition 
Location names have some composition characters. 
1) There may be some key words as suffix, such as: 
??/Shi, ?/Zheng, ?/Hu, ?/Shan? etc. 2) Other 
parts of Location names are always OOV words, 
such as ????/Dagang Village, ???/Fuzi 
Temple?.  So the right boundary of Location can 
be determined easily. The mainly problem in 
Location recognition is on abbreviation, such as 
?????/JinJiLuYu? is the combination of four 
location abbreviations. In our system, CRFs model 
can be supported by the heuristic searching method 
because it can match the abbreviation of entity in 
list. Using the searching method can boost the 
recall rate of location recognition significantly. We 
construct the recognition model based on the word-
segmented texts. 
To construct a CRFs model, we select the 
following features: 
z A list of key word suffix is used to trigger the 
recognition processing. 
z Using a list of indication words to restrict the 
boundary. 
z Heuristic searching method is used to assist 
Location recognition. 
The features we used in CRFs model is followed: 
 
W0 Current Word 
W-1?W-2 , W1?W2 Two words before and 
behind 
W-1W0?W0W1 Bi-gram Features 
POS0 POS tag 
PRE-1?PRE0?PRE1 Pre-Position reference 
words 
SRE-1?SRE0?SRE1 Suf-Position reference 
words 
Key Has Key suffix 
DIC In Dictionary 
Table 2. Features used in Location recognition 
Statement: 
The indication words used in Location 
recognition include ?for-indicate? and ?back-
indicate? words, where ?for-indicate? denotes the 
indicating words that occur as the left neighbor of 
the candidate Location named entity, while ?back-
indicate? denotes the indicating words that occur 
as the right neighbor. ?for-indicate? and ?back-
indicate? words are got from the training corpus. 
We calculate the mutual information between 
neighbor words and location entity, and get the top 
N words as indication words. 
( , )
( , ) ( , ) log
( ) ( )
p x y
MI x y p x y
p x p y
=     (4) 
We select 1216 for-indicate words and 1227 
back-indicate words. We also get 607 key words as 
location name suffix. 
3.5 Organization names recognition 
Organization name recognition is the most difficult 
part in NER task. The difficulties are as follows. 1) 
The composition of Organization name is very 
complex. For example: ??? ??/Dalian /Shide 
??/Group?, the first words in the entity is a 
location name. The second is a phonetic name 
173
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
which is also an OOV word and the last one is a 
key word as suffix.2) The boundary of organizat-
ion name is hard to be classified, and the length of 
organization names is dynamitic. 3) Organization 
names are easily confused as Location names. We 
must use contextual information to determine its 
type. 4) To recognize the abbreviation of an 
organization is also a difficult task. So we choose 
the following features to solve the above problems. 
z A list of key word suffix is used to trigger the 
recognition processing. 
z Using indication words to define the boundary 
of organization. 
z Heuristic searching method is used to assist 
Location recognition. 
The features we used in the CRFs model are the 
same as used in Location model. We use the 
mutual information to select 513 for-indicate 
words and 1195 back-indicate words from training 
corpus. The number of key suffix words is 3129. 
4 Experiments 
We participate in the SigHAN Microsoft Research 
Asia (MSRA) corpus in open track. The table 3 is 
the official result of NER by our system.

Organization 0.8778 0.9338 0.9049 
overall 0.9377 0.9603 0.9489 
Table 3.  SigHAN MSRA corpus test results 
The training corpora we used comes from 1) 
1998 People?s Daily corpus; 2) the training corpus 
supplied by MSRA for SigHAN bakeoff 4. These 
two corpora have many difference and we focus on 
how to get a good performance both on training 
corpus and testing corpus. We select some general 
features and get assistance from the heuristic 
searching method. A good list is very important, 
which has been proved by the experimental data. 
We collect nearly 1 million personal names, 40 
thousand location names and more than 300,000 
organization names. 
5 Conclusion 
In the paper, we give a presentation to our Chinese 
Named Entity Recognition System. It uses a 
language mode to recognize personal names, and 
two CRFs models to find Location and 
organization separately. We also have a flexible 
heuristic searching method to match entity in 
named entity list with text characters sequence. 
Our system achieves a good result in the open 
NER track of MSRA corpus.
