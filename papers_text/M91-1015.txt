RESULTS
This site report is intended as a companion piece to the System Summary appearing in this volume an d
is best read in conjunction with it . In particular, it refers to the various modules of the system which ar e
described in that paper .
Here only the overall results will be summarized . A more detailed, component-by-component analysis of
the results is contained in the System Summary .
Our results for the TST2 corpus were as follows :
Recall Precisio n
Matched Templates 44 6 5
Matched/Missing 25 6 5
All Templates 25 48
Our precision was the highest of any of the sites . Our recall was somewhere in the middle . It is as yet
unclear whether high recall-high precision systems will evolve more rapidly from low recall-high precisio n
systems or high recall-low precision systems .
The significant drop in recall we experienced from Matched Templates Only to Matched/Missing is a n
indication that we were failing on messages with a large number of template entries . Much of this is probabl y
due to failures in handling lists of names, and could be improved by specialized handling of this phenomenon .
We also ran our system, configured identically to the TST2 run, on the first 100 messages of the devel-
opment set . The results were as follows :
Recall Precision
Matched Templates 46 64
Matched/Missing 37 64
All Templates 37 5 3
Here recall was considerably better, as would be expected since the messages were used for development .
While there are a number of parameter settings possible in our system, we decided upon optimal values ,
and those values were used. An explanation of the parameters and how we decided what was optimal is to o
detailed and system-particular for this report . None of the decisions was made on the basis of total recal l
and precision on a test set . All the decisions were made on a much more local basis .
LEVEL OF EFFORT
The only way of even approximating the amount of time spent on this effort is from figures on time
charged to the project . All participants in the MUC-3 process will realize that this is not a very reliable wa y
of estimating the level of effort .
Since the preliminary MUC-3 workshop in February, approximately 800 person-hours were spent on th e
project .
105
The only possible way to break that down into subtasks is by personnel .
Preprocessor, system development, testing : 180 hours
Development of parsing algorithms :
	
180 hours
Grammar development :
	
220 hours
Pragmatics and template-generation :
	
220 hours
THE LIMITING FACTO R
Time .
TRAININ G
The amount of the training corpus that was used varied with the component . For the relevance filter, al l
1400 available messages were used . For the lexicon, every word in the first 600 and last 200 messages and i n
the TST1 corpus were entered . For the remaining messages, those words occurring more than once and al l
non-nouns were entered .
For syntax and pragmatics, we were able only to focus on the first 100 messages in the developmen t
corpus .
Tests were run almost entirely on the first 100 messages because those were the only ones for which a
reliable key existed and because concentrating on those would give us a stable measure of progress .
The system improved over time. On the February TST1 run, our recall was 14% and our precision wa s
68% on Matched and Missing Templates . At the end of March, on the first 100 messages in the development
set, our recall was 22% and our precision was 63% . At the time of the TST2 evaluation, on the first 10 0
messages in the development set, our recall was 37% and our precision was 64% .
WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL
As described in the System Summary, we felt that the treatment of unknown words was for the mos t
part adequate .
The statistical relevance filter was extremely successful . The keyword antifilter, on the other hand, i s
apparently far too coarse and needs to be refined or eliminated .
We felt syntactic analysis was a stunning success . At the beginning of this effort, we despaired of bein g
able to handle sentences of the length and complexity of those in the MUC-3 corpus, and indeed man y
sites abandoned syntactic analysis altogether . Now, however, we feel that the syntactic analysis of materia l
such as this is very nearly a solved problem. The coverage of our grammar, our scheduling parser, and ou r
heuristic of using the best sequence of fragments for failed parses combined to enable us to get a very hig h
proportion of the propositional content out of every sentence . The mistakes that we found in the first 2 0
messages of TST2 can, for the most part, be attributed to about five or six causes, which could be remedie d
with a few days work .
On the other hand, the results for terminal substring parsing, our method for dealing with sentences of
more than 60 words, are inconclusive, and we believe this technique could be improved .
In pragmatics, much work remains to be done . A large number of fairly simple axioms need to be written ,
as well as some more complex axioms . In the course of our preparation for MUC-2 and MUC-3, we hav e
made sacrifices in robustness for the sake of efficiency, and we would like to re-examine the trade-offs . We
would like to push more of the problems of syntactic and lexical ambiguity into the pragmatics component ,
rather than relying on syntactic heuristics . We would also like to further constrain factoring, which no w
sometimes results in the incorrect identification of distinct events .
In template-generation, we feel our basic framework is adequate, but a great many details must be added .
The module we would most like to rewrite is in fact not now a module but should be . It consists of the
various treatments of subcategorization, selectional constraints, generation of canonical predicate-argumen t
relations, and the sort hierarchy in pragmatics . At the present time, due to various historical accidents and
compromises, these are all effectively separate . The new module would give a unified treatment to this whol e
set of phenomena .

USABILITY FOR OTHER APPLICATION S
In the preprocessor, the spelling corrector and the morphological word assignment component are usabl e
in other applications without change .
The methods used in the relevance filter are usable in other applications, but, of course, the particula r
statistical model and set of keywords are not .
In the syntactic analysis component, the grammar and parsing programs and the vast majority of the
core lexicon are usable without change in another application . Only about five or six grammar rules are
particular to this domain, encoding the structure of the heading, interview conventions, "[words indistinct]" ,
and so on. The logical form produced is application-independent .
The theorem prover on which the pragmatics component is based is application-independent . All of the
enhancements we have made in our 1VIUC-3 effort would have benefited our MUC-2 effort as well .
In the knowledge base, only about 20 core axioms carried over from the opreps domain to the terroris t
domain . Since most of the current set of axioms is geared toward MUC-3 's particular task, there would ver y
probably not be much more of a carry-over to a new domain .
The extent to which the template-generation component would carry over to a new application depend s
on the extent to which the same baroque requirements are imposed on the output .
WHAT WAS LEARNED ABOUT EVALUATIO N
On the one hand, the mapping from texts to templates is discontinuous in the extreme . One mishandle d
semicolon can cost 4% in recall in the overall score, for example . Therefore, the numerical results of thi s
evaluation must he taken with a grain of salt . Things can he learned about the various systems only by
a deeper analysis of their performance . On the other hand, the task is difficult enough to provide a rea l
challenge, so that pushing recall and precision both into the 70s or 80s will require the system to do virtuall y
everything right .
Leading up to MUC-3 there were a great many difficulties to be worked out, diverting the attention o f
researchers from research to the mechanics of evaluation . It is to be hoped that most of these problems hav e
been settled and that for 1\'IUC-4 they will constitute less of a. drain on researchers ' time .
We feel the task of the MUC-3 evaluation is both feasible and challenging in the relatively short term .
How practical it is is for others to judge .
