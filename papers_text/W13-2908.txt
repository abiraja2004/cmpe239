Abstract
The task of identifying complex words
(CWs) is important for lexical simpli-
fication, however it is often carried out
with no evaluation of success. There is
no basis for comparison of current tech-
niques and, prior to this work, there
has been no standard corpus or eval-
uation technique for the CW identi-
fication task. This paper addresses
these shortcomings with a new cor-
pus for evaluating a system?s perfor-
mance in identifying CWs. Simple
Wikipedia edit histories were mined for
instances of single word lexical simpli-
fications. The corpus contains 731 sen-
tences, each with one annotated CW.
This paper describes the method used
to produce the CW corpus and presents
the results of evaluation, showing its
validity.
1 Introduction
CW identification techniques are typically im-
plemented as a preliminary step in a lexical
simplification system. The evaluation of the
identification of CWs is an often forgotten
task. Omitting this can cause a loss of accu-
racy at this stage which will adversely affect
the following processes and hence the user?s
understanding of the resulting text.
Previous approaches to the CW identifica-
tion task (see Section 5) have generally omit-
ted an evaluation of their method. This gap
in the literature highlights the need for evalu-
ation, for which gold standard data is needed.
This research proposes the CW corpus, a
dataset of 731 examples of sentences with ex-
actly one annotated CW per sentence.
A CW is defined as one which causes a sen-
tence to be more difficult for a user to read.
For example, in the following sentence:
?The cat reposed on the mat?
The presence of the word ?reposed? would re-
duce the understandability for some readers.
It would be difficult for some readers to work
out the sentence?s meaning, and if the reader
is unfamiliar with the word ?reposed?, they will
have to infer its meaning from the surrounding
context. Replacing this word with a more fa-
miliar alternative, such as ?sat?, improves the
understandability of the sentence, whilst re-
taining the majority of the original semantics.
Retention of meaning is an important fac-
tor during lexical simplification. If the word
?reposed? is changed to ?sat?, then the specific
meaning of the sentence will be modified (gen-
erally speaking, reposed may indicate a state
of relaxation, whereas sat indicates a body po-
sition) although the broad meaning is still the
same (a cat is on a mat in both scenarios). Se-
mantic shift should be kept to a minimum dur-
ing lexical simplification. Recent work (Biran
et al, 2011; Bott et al, 2012) has employed
distributional semantics to ensure simplifica-
tions are of sufficient semantic similarity.
Word complexity is affected by many fac-
tors such as familiarity, context, morphology
and length. Furthermore, these factors change
from person to person and context to context.
The same word, in a different sentence, may be
perceived as being of a different level of diffi-
culty. The same word in the same sentence,
but read by a different person, may also be
perceived as different in difficulty. For exam-
ple, a person who speaks English as a second
language will struggle with unfamiliar words
depending on their native tongue. Conversely,
the reader who has a low reading ability will
struggle with long and obscure words. Whilst
there will be some crossover in the language
69
these two groups find difficult, this will not be
exactly the same. This subjectivity makes the
automation and evaluation of CW identifica-
tion difficult.
Subjectivity makes the task of natural lan-
guage generation difficult and rules out auto-
matically generating annotated complex sen-
tences. Instead, our CW discovery process
(presented in Section 2) mines simplifications
from Simple Wikipedia1 edit histories. Sim-
ple Wikipedia is well suited to this task as it
is a website where language is collaboratively
and iteratively simplified by a team of editors.
These editors follow a set of strict guidelines
and accountability is enforced by the self polic-
ing community. Simple Wikipedia is aimed
at readers with a low English reading ability
such as children or people with English as a
second language. The type of simplifications
found in Wikipedia and thus mined for use in
our corpus are therefore appropriate for peo-
ple with low English proficiency. By capturing
these simplifications, we produce a set of gen-
uine examples of sentences which can be used
to evaluate the performance of CW identifi-
cation systems. It should be noted that al-
though these simplifications are best suited to
low English proficiency users, the CW identifi-
cation techniques that will be evaluated using
the corpus can be trained and applied for a
variety of user groups.

course of this research.
during their revisions of Simple Wikipedia ar-
ticles. These are in the form of sentences with
one word which has been identified as requir-
ing simplification.2 These examples can be
used to evaluate the output of a CW identi-
fication system (see Section 6). To make the
discovery and evaluation task easier, we limit
the discovered simplifications to one word per
sentence. So, if an edited sentence differs from
its original by more than one word, we do not
include it in our corpus. This also promotes
uniformity in the corpus, reducing the com-
plexity of the evaluation task.
2.1 Preliminaries
SUBTLEX
The SUBTLEX dataset (Brysbaert and New,
2009) is used as a familiarity dictionary. Its
primary function is to associate words with
their frequencies of occurrence, assuming that
words which occur more frequently are sim-
pler. SUBTLEX is also used as a dictionary
for testing word existence: if a word does not
occur in the dataset, it is not considered for
simplification. This may occur in the case of
very infrequent words or proper nouns. The
2We also record the simplification suggested by the
original Simple Wikipedia editor.
70
SUBTLEX data is chosen over the more con-
ventional Kuc?era-Francis frequency (Kuc?era
and Francis, 1967) and over a baseline pro-
duced from Wikipedia frequencies due to a
previous experiment using a lexical simplifica-
tion dataset from task 1 of SemEval 2012 (de
Belder and Moens, 2012). See Table 1.
Word Sense
Homonymy is the phenomenon of a wordform
having 2 distinct meanings as in the clas-
sic case: ?Bank of England? vs. ?River bank ?.
In each case, the word bank is referring to
a different semantic entity. This presents a
problem when calculating word frequency as
the frequencies for homonyms will be com-
bined. Word sense disambiguation is an un-
solved problem and was not addressed whilst
creating the CW corpus. The role of word
sense in lexical simplification will be investi-
gated at a later stage of this research.
Yatskar et al (2010)
The CW corpus was built following the work
of Yatskar et al (2010) in identifying para-
phrases from Simple Wikipedia edit histo-
ries. Their method extracts lexical edits from
aligned sentences in adjacent revisions of a
Simple Wikipedia article. These lexical edits
are then processed to determine their likeli-
hood of being a true simplification. Two meth-
ods for determining this probability are pre-
sented, the first uses conditional probability
to determine whether a lexical edit represents
a simplification and the second uses metadata
from comments to generate a set of trusted
revisions, from which simplifications can be
detected using pointwise mutual information.
Our method (further explained in Section 2.2)
differs from their work in several ways. Firstly,
we seek to discover only single word lexical ed-
its. Secondly, we use both article metadata
and a series of strict checks against a lexicon,
a thesaurus and a simplification dictionary to
ensure that the extracted lexical edits are true
simplifications. Thirdly, we retain the original
context of the simplification as lexical com-
plexity is thought to be influenced by context
(Biran et al, 2011; Bott et al, 2012).
Automatically mining edit histories was
chosen as it provides many instances quickly
and at a low cost. The other method of cre-
ating a similar corpus would have been to
ask several professionally trained annotators
to produce hundreds of sets of sentences, and
to mark up the CWs in these. The use of
professionals would be expensive and annota-
tors may not agree on the way in which words
should be simplified, leading to further prob-
lems when combining annotations.
2.2 Method
In this section, we explain the procedure to
create the corpus. There are many process-
ing stages as represented graphically in Figure
1. The stages in the diagram are further de-
scribed in the sections below. For simplicity,
we view Simple Wikipedia as a set of pages
P, each with an associated set of revisions R.
Every revision of every page is processed iter-
atively until P is exhausted.
Content Articles
The Simple Wikipedia edit histories were ob-
tained.3 The entire database was very large,
so only main content articles were considered.
All user, talk and meta articles were discarded.
Non-content articles are not intended to be
read by typical users and so may not reflect
the same level of simplicity as the rest of the
site.
Revisions which Simplify
When editing a Simple Wikipedia article, the
author has the option to attach a comment to
their revision. Following the work of Yatskar
et al (2010), we only consider those revisions
which have a comment containing some mor-
phological equivalent of the lemma ?simple?,
e.g. simplify, simplifies, simplification, simpler,
etc. This allows us to search for comments
where the author states that they are simpli-
fying the article.
Tf-idf Matrix
Each revision is a set of sentences. As changes
from revision to revision are often small, there
will be many sentences which are the same in
adjacent revisions. Sentences which are likely
to contain a simplification will only have one
word difference and sentences which are un-
related will have many different words. Tf-idf
(Salton and Yang, 1973) vectors are calculated

for each sentence and the matrix containing
the dot product of every pair of sentence vec-
tors from the first and second revision is cal-
culated. This allows us to easily see those vec-
tors which are exactly the same ? as these
will have a score of one.4 It also allows us to
easily see which vectors are so different that
they could not contain a one word edit. We
empirically set a threshold at 0.9 <= X < 1
to capture those sentences which were highly
related, but not exactly the same.
Candidate Pairs
The above process resulted in pairs of sen-
tences which were very similar according to
the tf-idf metric. These pairs were then sub-
jected to a series of checks as detailed below.
These were designed to ensure that as few false
positives as possible would make it to the cor-
pus. This may have meant discarding some
true positives too, however the cautious ap-
proach was adopted to ensure a higher corpus
accuracy.
Hamming Distance
We are only interested in those sentences with
a difference of one word, because sentences
with more than one word difference may con-
tain several simplifications or may be a re-
wording. It is more difficult to distinguish
whether these are true simplifications. We
calculate the Hamming distance between sen-
tences (using wordforms as base units) to en-
sure that only one word differs. Any sentence
pairs which do not have a Hamming distance
of 1 are discarded.
Reality Check
The first check is to ensure that both the words
are a part of our lexicon, ensuring that there
is SUBTLEX frequency data for these words
and also that they are valid words. This stage
may involve removing some valid words, which
are not found in the lexicon, however this is
preferable to allowing words that are the result
of spam or vandalism.
4As tf-idf treats a sentence as a bag of words it is
possible for two sentences to give a score of 1 if they
contain the same words, but in a different order. This
is not a problem as if the sentence order is different,
there is a minimum of 2 lexical edits ? meaning we
still wish to discount this pair.
Inequality Check
It is possible that although a different word
is present, it is a morphological variant of
the original word rather than a simplification.
E.g., due to a change in tense, or a correc-
tion. To identify this, we stem both words
and compare them to make sure they are not
the same. If the word stems are equal then
they are unlikely to be a simplification, so this
pair is discarded. Some valid simplifications
may also be removed at this point, however
these are difficult to distinguish from the non-
simplifications.
Synonymy Check
Typically, lexical simplification involves the se-
lection of a word?s synonym. WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) is used as a thesaurus to check if
the second word is listed as a synonym of the
first. As previously discussed (Section 2.1),
we do not take word sense into account at this
point. Some valid simplifications may not be
identified as synonyms in WordNet, however
we choose to take this risk ? discarding all
non-synonym pairs. Improving thesaurus cov-
erage for complex words is left to future work.
Stemming is favoured over lemmatisation
for two reasons. Firstly, because lemmatisa-
tion requires a lot of processing power and
would have terminally slowed the process-
ing of the large revision histories. Secondly,
stemming is a dictionary-independent tech-
nique, meaning it can handle any unknown
words. Lemmatisation requires a large dic-
tionary, which may not contain the rare CWs
which are identified.
Simplicity Check
Finally, we check that the second word is sim-
pler than the first using the SUBTLEX fre-
quencies. All these checks result in a pair of
sentences, with one word difference. The dif-
fering words are synonyms and the change has
been to a word which is simpler than the origi-
nal. Given these conditions have been met, we
store the pair in our CW Corpus as an example
of a lexical simplification.
2.3 Examples
This process was used to mine the following
two examples:
73
Complex word: functions.
Simple word: uses.
A dictionary has been designed to have one
or more that can help the user in a
particular situation.
Complex word: difficult
Simple word: hard
Readability tests give a prediction as to how
readers will find a particular text.
3 Corpus Analysis
3.1 Experimental Design
To determine the validity of the CW corpus, a
set of six mutually exclusive 50-instance ran-
dom samples from the corpus were turned into
questionnaires. One was given to each of 6
volunteer annotators who were asked to deter-
mine, for each sentence, whether it was a true
example of a simplification or not. If so, they
marked the example as correct. This binary
choice was employed to simplify the task for
the annotators. A mixture of native and non-
native English speakers was used, although no
marked difference was observed between these
groups. All the annotators are proficient in
English and currently engaged in further or
higher education. In total, 300 instances of
lexical simplification were evaluated, covering
over 40% of the CW corpus.
A 20 instance sample was also created as
a validation set. The same 20 instances
were randomly interspersed among each of the
6 datasets and used to calculate the inter-
annotator agreement. The validation data
consisted of 10 examples from the CW cor-
pus and 10 examples that were filtered out
during the earlier stages of processing. This
provided sufficient positive and negative data
to show the annotator?s understanding of the
task. These examples were hand picked to rep-
resent positive and negative data and are used
as a gold standard.
Agreement with the gold standard is cal-
culated using Cohen?s kappa (Cohen, 1968).
Inter-annotator agreement is calculated using
Fleiss? kappa (Fleiss, 1971), as in the evalua-
tion of a similar task presented in de Belder
and Moens (2012). In total, each annotator
was presented with 70 examples and asked to

Table 2: The results of different annota-
tions. The kappa score is given against
the gold standard set of 20 instances. The
sample accuracy is the percentage of the
50 instances seen by that annotator which
were judged to be true examples of a lex-
ical simplification. Note that kappa is
strongly correlated with accuracy (Pear-
son?s correlation: r = 0.980)
label these. A small sample size was used to
reduce the effects of annotator fatigue.
3.2 Results
Of the six annotations, four show the exact
same results on the validation set. These four
identify each of the 10 examples from the CW
corpus as a valid simplification and each of the
10 examples that were filtered out as an invalid
simplification. This is expected as these two
sets of data were selected as examples of posi-
tive and negative data respectively. The agree-
ment of these four annotators further corrob-
orates the validity of the gold standard. An-
notator agreement is shown in Table 2.
The 2 other annotators did not strongly
agree on the validation sets. Calculating Co-
hen?s kappa between each of these annotators
and the gold standard gives scores of 0.6 and
0.4 respectively, indicating a moderate to low
level of agreement. The value for Cohen?s
kappa between the two non-agreeing annota-
tors is 0.2, indicating that they are in low
agreement with each other.
Analysing the errors made by these 2 anno-
tators on the validation set reveals some in-
consistencies. E.g., one sentence marked as
incorrect changes the fragment ?education and
teaching? to ?learning and teaching?. However,
every other annotator marked the enclosing
sentence as correct. This level of inconsistency
and low agreement with the other annotators
74
shows that these annotators had difficulty with
the task. They may not have read the instruc-
tions carefully or may not have understood the
task fully.
Corpus accuracy is defined as the percentage
of instances that were marked as being true
instances of simplification (not counting those
in the validation set). This is out of 50 for
each annotator and can be combined linearly
across all six annotators.
Taking all six annotators into account, the
corpus accuracy is 90.67%. Removing the
worst performing annotator (kappa = 0.4) in-
creases the corpus accuracy to 94.80%. If we
also remove the next worst performing annota-
tor (kappa = 0.6), leaving us with only the four
annotators who were in agreement on the val-
idation set, then the accuracy increases again
to 97.5%.
There is a very strong Pearson?s correlation
(r = 0.980) between an annotator?s agreement
with the gold standard and the accuracy which
they give to the corpus. Given that the lower
accuracy reported by the non-agreeing anno-
tators is in direct proportion to their devia-
tion from the gold standard, this implies that
the reduction is a result of the lower quality
of those annotations. Following this, the two
non-agreeing annotators should be discounted
when evaluating the corpus accuracy ? giving
a final value of 97.5%.
4 Discussion
The necessity of this corpus developed from a
lack of similar resources. CW identification is
a hard task, made even more difficult if blind
to its evaluation. With this new resource, CW
identification becomes much easier to evaluate.
The specific target application for this is lex-
ical simplification systems as previously men-
tioned. By establishing and improving upon
the state of the art in CW identification, lexi-
cal simplification systems will directly benefit
by knowing which wordforms are problematic
to a user.
Methodologically, the corpus is simple to use
and can be applied to evaluate many current
systems (see Section 6). Techniques using dis-
tributional semantics (Bott et al, 2012) may
require more context than is given by just the
sentence. This is a shortcoming of the corpus
in its present form, although not many tech-
niques currently require this level of context.
If necessary, context vectors may be extracted
by processing Simple Wikipedia edit histories
(as presented in Section 2.2) and extracting
the required information at the appropriate
point.
There are 731 lexical edits in the corpus.
Each one of these may be used as an exam-
ple of a complex and a simple word, giving us
1,462 points of data for evaluation. This is
larger than a comparable data set for a simi-
lar task (de Belder and Moens, 2012). Ways
to further increase the number of instances are
discussed in Section 6.
It would appear from the analysis of the val-
idation sets (presented above in Section 3.2)
that two of the annotators struggled with the
task of annotation, attaining a low agreement
against the gold standard. This is most likely
due to the annotators misunderstanding the
task. The annotations were done at the indi-
vidual?s own workstation and the main guid-
ance was in the form of instructions on the
questionnaire. These instructions should be
updated and clarified in further rounds of an-
notation. It may be useful to allow annotators
direct contact with the person administering
the questionnaire. This would allow clarifi-
cation of the instructions where necessary, as
well as helping annotators to stay focussed on
the task.
The corpus accuracy of 97.5% implies that
there is a small error rate in the corpus. This
occurs due to some non-simplifications slip-
ping through the checks. The error rate means
that if a system were to identify CWs perfectly,
it would only attain 97.5% accuracy on the
CW corpus. CW identification is a difficult
task and systems are unlikely to have such a
high accuracy that this will be an issue. If sys-
tems do begin to attain this level of accuracy
then a more rigorous corpus will be warranted
in future.
There is significant interest in lexical sim-
plification for languages which are not English
(Bott et al, 2012; Alu??sio and Gasperin, 2010;
Dell?Orletta et al, 2011; Keskisa?rkka?, 2012).
The technique for discovering lexical simpli-
fications presented here relies heavily on the
existence of Simple English Wikipedia. As no
75
other simplified language Wikipedia exists, it
would be very difficult to create a CW corpus
for any language other than English. However,
the corpus can be used to evaluate CW identi-
fication techniques which will be transferrable
to other languages, given the existence of suf-
ficient resources.
5 Related Work
As previously noted, there is a systemic lack
of evaluation in the literature. Notable excep-
tions come from the medical domain and in-
clude the work of Zeng et al (2005), Zeng-
Treitler et al (2008) and Elhadad (2006).
Zeng et al (2005) first look at word familiarity
scoring correlated against user questionnaires
and predictions made by a support vector ma-
chine. They show that they are able to predict
the complexity of medical terminology with a
relative degree of accuracy. This work is con-
tinued in Zeng-Treitler et al (2008), where a
word?s context is used to predict its familiar-
ity. This is similarly correlated against a user
survey and used to show the importance of
context in predicting word familiarity. The
work of Elhadad (2006) uses frequency and
psycholinguistic features to predict term famil-
iarity. They find that the size of their corpus
greatly affects their accuracy. Whilst these
techniques focus on the medical domain, the
research presented in this paper is concerned
with the more general task of CW identifica-
tion in natural language.
There are two standard ways of identifying
CWs in lexical simplification systems. Firstly,
systems attempt to simplify every word (De-
vlin and Tait, 1998; Thomas and Anderson,
2012; Bott et al, 2012), assuming that CWs
will be modified, but for simple words, no
simpler alternative will exist. The danger is
that too many simple words may be mod-
ified unnecessarily, resulting in a change of
meaning. Secondly, systems use a threshold
over some word familiarity score (Biran et al,
2011; Elhadad, 2006; Zeng et al, 2005). Word
frequency is typically used as the familiarity
score, although it may also be combined with
word length (Biran et al, 2011). The advent
of the CW corpus will allow these techniques
to be evaluated alongside each other on a com-
mon data set.
The CW corpus is similar in conception
to the aforementioned lexical simplification
dataset (de Belder and Moens, 2012) which
was produced for the SemEval 2012 Task 1 on
lexical simplification. This dataset alows syn-
onym ranking systems to be evaluated on the
same platform and was highly useful during
this research (see Table 1).
6 Future Work
The CW corpus is still relatively small at
731 instances. It may be grown by carrying
out the same process with revision histories
from the main English Wikipedia. Whilst the
English Wikipedia revision histories will have
fewer valid simplifications per revision, they
are much more extensive and contain a lot
more data. As well as growing the CW corpus
in size, it would be worthwhile to look at ways
to improve its accuracy. One way would be
to ask a team of annotators to evaluate every
single instance in the corpus and to discard or
keep each according to their recommendation.
Experiments using the corpus are presented
in Shardlow (2013), further details on the use
of the corpus can be found by following this
reference. Three common techniques for iden-
tifying CWs are implemented and statistically
evaluated. The CW Corpus is available from
META-SHARE5 under a CC-BY-SA Licence.
