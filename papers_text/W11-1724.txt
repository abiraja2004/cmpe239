Abstract
This paper presents two instance-level transfer
learning based algorithms for cross lingual
opinion analysis by transferring useful
translated opinion examples from other
languages as the supplementary training
data for improving the opinion classifier in
target language. Starting from the union of
small training data in target language and
large translated examples in other languages,
the Transfer AdaBoost algorithm is applied
to iteratively reduce the influence of low
quality translated examples. Alternatively,
starting only from the training data in target
language, the Transfer Self-training algorithm
is designed to iteratively select high quality
translated examples to enrich the training
data set. These two algorithms are applied to
sentence- and document-level cross lingual
opinion analysis tasks, respectively. The
evaluations show that these algorithms
effectively improve the opinion analysis by
exploiting small target language training data
and large cross lingual training data.
1 Introduction
In recent years, with the popularity of Web 2.0,
massive amount of personal opinions including
comments, reviews and recommendations in dif-
ferent languages have been shared on the Internet.
Accordingly, automated opinion analysis has
attracted growing attentions. Opinion analysis, also
known as sentiment analysis, sentiment classifica-
tion, and opinion mining, aims to identify opinions
in text and classify their sentiment polarity (Pang
and Lee, 2008).
Many sentiment resources such as sentiment
lexicons (e.g., SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006))and opinion corpora (e.g., MPQA (Blitzer
et al, 2007)) have been developed on different
languages in which most of them are for English.
The lack of reliably sentiment resources is one
of the core issues in opinion analysis for other
languages. Meanwhile, the manually annotation
is costly, thus the amount of available annotated
opinion corpora are still insufficient for supporting
supervised learning, even for English. These facts
motivate to ?borrow? the opinion resources in one
language (source language, SL) to another language
(target language, TL) for improving the opinion
analysis on the target language.
Cross lingual opinion analysis (CLOA) tech-
niques are investigated to improve opinion analysis
in TL through leveraging the opinion-related
resources, such as dictionaries and annotated
corpus in SL. Some CLOA works used bilingual
dictionaries (Mihalcea et al, 2007), or aligned
corpus (Kim and Hovy, 2006) to align the expres-
sions between source and target languages. These
works are puzzled by the limited aligned opinion
resources. Alternatively, some works used machine
translation system to do the opinion expression
alignment. Banea et al (2008) proposed several
approaches for cross lingual subjectivity analysis by
directly applying the translations of opinion corpus
in source language to train the opinion classifier
on target language. Wan (2009) combined the
annotated English reviews, unannotated Chinese
reviews and their translations to co-train two
separate classifiers for each language, respectively.
182
These works directly used all of the translation of
annotated corpus in source language as the training
data for target language without considering the
following two problems: (1) the machine translation
errors propagate to following CLOA procedure; (2)
The annotated corpora from different languages are
collected from different domains and different writ-
ing styles which lead the training and testing data
having different feature spaces and distributions.
Therefore, the performances of these supervised
learning algorithms are affected.
To address these problems, we propose two
instance level transfer learning based algorithms
to estimate the confidence of translated SL ex-
amples and to transfer the promising ones as
the supplementary TL training data. We firstly
apply Transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) (Dai et
al., 2007) to improve the overall performance with
the union of target and translated source language
training corpus. A boosting-like strategy is used
to down-weight the wrongly classified translated
examples during iterative training procedure. This
method aims to reduce the negative affection of low
quality translated examples. Secondly, we propose
a new Transfer Self-training algorithm (TrStr). This
algorithm trains the classifier by using only the
target language training data at the beginning. By
automatically labeling and selecting the translated
examples which is correct classified with higher
confidence, the classifier is iteratively trained by
appending new selected training examples. The
training procedure is terminated until no new
promising examples can be selected. Differen-
t from TrAdaBoost, TrStr aims to select high
quality translated examples for classifier training.
These algorithms are evaluated on sentence- and
document-level CLOA tasks, respectively. The
evaluations on simplified Chinese (SC) opinion
analysis by using small SC training data and large
traditional Chinese (TC) and English (EN) training
data, respectively, show that the proposed transfer
learning based algorithms effectively improve the
CLOA. Noted that, these algorithms are applicable
to different language pairs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the transfer learning based
approaches for opinion analysis. Evaluations and
discussions are presented in Section 3. Finally,
Section 4 gives the conclusions and future work.
2 CLOA via Transfer Learning
Given a large translated SL opinion training data,
the objective of this study is to transfer more high
quality training examples for improving the TL
opinion analysis rather than use the whole translated
training data. Here, we propose to investigate the
instance level transfer learning based approaches.
In the case of transfer learning, the set of trans-
lated training SL examples is denoted by Ts =
{(xi, yi)}ni=1, and the TL training data is denoted
by Tt={(xi, yi)}n+mi=n+1, while the size of Tt is much
smaller than that of Ts, i.e., |m| ? |n|. The idea
of transfer learning is to use Tt as the indicator to
estimate the quality of translated examples. By
appending selected high quality translated examples
as supplement training data, the performance of
opinion analysis on TL is expected to be enhanced.
2.1 The TrAdaBoost Approach
TrAdaBoost is an extension of the AdaBoost
algorithm (Freund and Schapir, 1996). It uses
boosting technique to adjust the sample weight
automatically (Dai et al, 2007). TrAdaBoost joins
both the source and target language training data
during learning phase with different re-weighting
strategy. The base classifier is trained on the
union of the weighted source and target examples,
while the training error rate is measured on the
TL training data only. In each iteration, for a SL
training example, if it is wrongly classified by prior
base classifier, it tends to be a useless examples
or conflict with the TL training data. Thus, the
corresponding weight will be reduced to decrease
its negative impact. On the contrary, if a TL training
example is wrongly classified, the corresponding
weight will be increased to boost it. The ensemble
classifier is obtained after several iterations.
In this study, we apply TrAdaBoost algorithm
with small revision to fit the CLOA task, as de-
scribed in Algorithm 1. Noted that, our revised
algorithm can handle multi-category problem which
is different with original TrAdaBoost algorithm for
binary classification problem only. More details and
theoretical analysis of TrAdaBoost are given in Dai
et al?s work (Dai et al, 2007).

2.2 The Transfer Self-training Approach
Different from TrAdaBoost which focuses on the
filtering of low quality translated examples, we
propose a new Transfer Self-training algorithm
(TrStr) to iteratively train the classifier through
transferring high quality translated SL training data
to enrich the TL training data. The flow of this
algorithm is given in Algorithm 2.
The algorithm starts from training a classifier
on Tt. This classifier is then applied to Ts, the
translated SL training data. For each category in
Ts (subjective/objective or positive/negative in our
different experiments), top p correctly classified
translated examples are selected. These translated
examples are regarded as high quality ones and thus
they are appended in the TL training data. Next, the
classifier is re-trained on the enriched training data.
The updated classifier is applied to SL examples
again to select more high quality examples. Such

procedure terminates until the increments are less
than a specified threshold or the maximum number
of iterations is exceeded. The final classifier is
obtained by training on the union of target data and
selected high quality translated SL training data.
3 Evaluation and Discussion
The proposed approaches are evaluated on sentence-
and document-level opinion analysis tasks in the
bi-lingual case, respectively. In our experiments,
the TL is simplified Chinese (SC) and the SL for
the two experiments are English (EN)/traditional
Chinese (TC) and EN, respectively.
3.1 Experimental Setup
3.1.1 Datasets
In the sentence-level opinionated sentence recog-
nition experiment , the dataset is from the NTCIR-7
Multilingual Opinion Analysis Tasks (MOAT) (Se-
ki et al, 2008) corpora. The information of
this dataset is given in Table 1. Two experi-
ments are performed. The first one is denoted by
SenOR : TC ? SC, which uses TCs as source
language training dataset, while the second one
184
is SenOR : EN ? SC, which uses ENs1. SCs
is shrunk to different scale as the target language
training corpus by random. The opinion analysis
results are evaluated with simplified Chinese testing
dataset SCt under lenient and strict evaluation
standard 2, respectively, as described in (Seki et al,
2008).

In the document-level review polarity classifi-
cation experiment,, we used the dataset adopted
in (Wan, 2009). Its English subset is collected by
Blitzer et al (2007), which contains a collection of
8,000 product reviews about four types of products:
books, DVDs, electronics and kitchen appliances.
For each type of products, there are 1,000 positive
reviews and 1,000 negative ones, respectively. The
Chinese subset has 451 positive reviews and 435
negative reviews of electronics products such as
mp3 players, mobile phones etc. In our experiments,
the Chinese subset is further split into two parts
randomly: TL training dataset and test set. The
cross lingual review polarity classification task is
then denoted by DocSC: EN?SC.
In this study, Google Translate3 is choose for pro-
viding machine translation results.
3.1.2 Base Classifier and Baseline Methods
This study focus on the approaches improving the
opinion analysis by using cross lingual examples,
while the classifier improving on target language is
not our major target. Therefore, in the experiments,
a Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear
kernel is used as the base classifier. We use the
1There are only 248 sentences in NTCIR-7 MOAT English
training data set. It is too small to use for CLOA. We s-
plit some samples from the test set to build a new English
dataset for training, which contains all sentences from topics:
N01,N02,T01,N02,N03,N04,N05,N06 and N07.
2All sentences are annotated by 3 assessors, strict standard
means all 3 assessors have the same annotation and lenient
means any 2 of them have the same annotation.

open source SVM package ?LIBSVM(Chang and
Lin, 2001) with all default parameters. In the
opinionated sentence recognition experiment, we
use the presences of following linguistic features
to represent each sentence example including
opinion word, opinion operator, opinion indicator,
the unigram and bigram of Chinese words. It is
developed with the reference of (Xu et al, 2008).
In the review polarity classification experiment, we
use unigram, bigram of Chinese words as features
which is suggested by (Wan, 2009). Here, document
frequency is used for feature selection. Meanwhile,
term frequency weighting is chosen for document
representation.
In order to investigate the effectiveness of the
two proposed transfer learning approaches, they
are compared with following baseline methods: (1)
NoTr(T), which applies SVM with only TL training
data; (2) NoTr(S),which applies SVM classifier with
only the translated SL training data; (3) NoTr(S&T),
which applies SVM with the union of TL and SL
training data.
3.1.3 Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy (Acc), precision (P), recall (R) and F-
measure (F1) are used as evaluation metrics. All the
performances are the average of 10 experiments.
3.2 Experimental Results and Discussion
Here, the number of iterations in TrAdaBoost is set
to 10 in order to avoid over-discarding SL examples.
3.2.1 Sentence Level CLOA Results
The achieved performance of the opinionated
sentence recognition task under lenient and strict
evaluation are given in Table 2 respectively, in
which only 1/16 target train data is used as Tt.
It is shown that NoTr(T) achieves a acceptable
accuracy, but the recall and F1 for ?subjective?
category are obviously low. For the two sub-tasks,
i.e. SenOR : TC ?SC and SenOR :EN ?SC
tasks, the accuracies achieved by NoTr(S&T) are
always between that of NoTr(T) and NoTr(S).
The reason is that some translated examples from
source language may likely conflict with the target
language training data. It is shown that the direct
use of all of the translated training data is infeasible.
It is also shown that our approaches achieve better

and Fig 3(b) uses both unigrams and bigrams. It is
observed that TrAdaBoost and TrStr achieve better
performances than the baseline NoTr(S&T) in most
cases. More specifically, TrStr performs the best
when few TL training data is used. When more TL
training data is used, the performance improvements
by transfer learning approaches become small. The
reason is that less target training data is helpful to
transfer useful knowledge in translated examples.
If too much TL training data is used, the weights
of SL instances may decrease exponentially after
several iterations, and thus more source training
data is not obviously helpful.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
To address the problems in CLOA caused by inac-
curate translations and different domain/category
distributions between training data in different
languages, two transfer learning based algorithms
are investigated to transfer promising translated SL
training data for improving the TL opinion analysis.
In this study, Transfer AdaBoost and Transfer
Self-Training algorithms are investigated to reduce
the influences of low quality translated examples
and to select high quality translated examples,
respectively. The evaluations on sentence- and
document-level opinion analysis tasks show that the
proposed algorithms improve opinion analysis by
using the union of few TL training data and selected
cross lingual training data.
One of our future directions is to develop other
transfer leaning algorithms for CLOA task. Another
future direction is to employ other moderate weight-
ing scheme on source training dataset to reduce the
over-discarding of training examples from source
language.
