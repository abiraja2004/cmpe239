Abstract 
Cross-language retrieval of spontaneous 
speech combines the challenges of working 
with noisy automated transcription and lan-
guage translation. The CLEF 2005 Cross-
Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task 
provides a standard test collection to inves-
tigate these challenges. We show that we 
can improve retrieval performance: by care-
ful selection of the term weighting scheme; 
by decomposing automated transcripts into 
phonetic substrings to help ameliorate tran-
scription errors; and by combining auto-
matic transcriptions with manually-assigned 
metadata. We further show that topic trans-
lation with online machine translation re-
sources yields effective CL-SR. 
1 Introduction 
The emergence of large collections of digitized 
spoken data has encouraged research in speech re-
trieval. Previous studies, notably those at TREC 
(Garafolo et al 2000), have focused mainly on 
well-structured news documents. In this paper we 
report on work carried out for the Cross-Language 
Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2005 Cross-Language 
Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) track (White et al 2005). 
The document collection for the CL-SR task is a 
part of the oral testimonies collected by the USC 
Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and 
Education (VHI) for which some Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR) transcriptions are available 
(Oard et al, 2004). The data is conversional spon-
taneous speech lacking clear topic boundaries; it is 
thus a more challenging speech retrieval task than 
those explored previously. The CLEF data is also 
annotated with a range of automatic and manually 
generated sets of metadata. While the complete VHI 
dataset contains interviews in many languages, the 
CLEF 2005 CL-SR task focuses on English speech. 
Cross-language searching is evaluated by making 
the topic statements (from which queries are auto-
matically formed) available in several languages. 
This task raises many interesting research ques-
tions; in this paper we explore alternative term 
weighting methods and content indexing strategies.  
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: Section 2 briefly reviews details of the CLEF 
2005 CL-SR task; Section 3 describes the system 
we used to investigate this task; Section 4 reports 
our experimental results; and Section 5 gives con-
clusions and details for our ongoing work.   
2 Task description 
The CLEF-2005 CL-SR collection includes 8,104 
manually-determined topically-coherent segments 
from 272 interviews with Holocaust survivors, wit-
nesses and rescuers, totaling 589 hours of speech. 
Two ASR transcripts are available for this data, in 
this work we use transcripts provided by IBM Re-
search in 2004 for which a mean word error rate of 
38% was computed on held out data. Additional, 
metadata fields for each segment include: two sets 
of 20 automatically assigned thesaurus terms from 
different kNN classifiers (AK1 and AK2), an aver-
age of 5 manually-assigned thesaurus terms (MK), 
and a 3-sentence summary written by a subject mat-
ter expert. A set of 38 training topics and 25 test 
topics were generated in English from actual user 
requests. Topics were structured as Title, Descrip-
tion and Narrative fields, which correspond roughly 
to a 2-3 word Web query, what someone might first 
say to a librarian, and what that librarian might ul-
timately understand after a brief reference inter-
view. To support CL-SR experiments the topics 
were re-expressed in Czech, German, French, and 
Spanish by native speakers in a manner reflecting 
61
the way questions would be posed in those lan-
guages. Relevance judgments were manually gener-
ated using by augmenting an interactive search-
guided procedure and purposive sampling designed 
to identify additional relevant segments. See (Oard 
et al 2004) and (White et al 2005) for details.  
3 System Overview 
Our Information Retrieval (IR) system was built 
with off-the-shelf components.  Topics were trans-
lated from French, Spanish, and German into Eng-
lish using seven free online machine translation 
(MT) tools. Their output was merged in order to 
allow for variety in lexical choices. All the transla-
tions of a topic Title field were combined in a 
merged Title field of the translated topics; the same 
procedure was adopted for the Description and Nar-
rative fields. Czech language topics were translated 
using InterTrans, the only web-based MT system 
available to us for this language pair. Retrieval was 
carried out using the SMART IR system (Buckley 
et al 1993) applying its standard stop word list and 
stemming algorithm.  
In system development using the training topics we 
tested SMART with many different term weighting 
schemes combining collection frequency, document 
frequency and length normalization for the indexed 
collection and topics (Salton and Buckley, 1988). In 
this paper we employ the notation used in SMART 
to describe the combined schemes: xxx.xxx. The 
first three characters refer to the weighting scheme 
used to index the document collection and the last 
three characters refer to the weighting scheme used 
to index the topic fields. For example, lpc.atc means 
that lpc was used for documents and atc for queries. 
lpc would apply log term frequency weighting (l) 
and probabilistic collection frequency weighting (p) 
with cosine normalization to the document collec-
tion (c). atc would apply augmented normalized 
term frequency (a), inverse document frequency 
weight (t) with cosine normalization (c). 
One scheme in particular (mpc.ntn) proved to 
have much better performance than other combina-
tions. For weighting document terms we used term 
frequency normalized by the maximum value (m) 
and probabilistic collection frequency weighting (p) 
with cosine normalization (c). For topics we used 
non-normalized term frequency (n) and inverse 
document frequency weighting (t) without vector 
normalization (n). This combination worked very 
well when all the fields of the query were used; it 
also worked well with Title plus Description, but 
slightly less well with the Title field alone. 
4 Experimental Investigation 
In this section we report results from our experi-
mental investigation of the CLEF 2005 CL-SR task. 
For each set of experiments we report Mean unin-
terpolated Average Precision (MAP) computed us-
ing the trec_eval script. The topic fields used are 
indicated as: T for title only, TD for title + descrip-
tion, TDN for title + description + narrative. The 
first experiment shows results for different term 
weighting schemes; we then give cross-language 
retrieval results. For both sets of experiments, 
?documents? are represented by combining the 
ASR transcription with the AK1 and AK2 fields. 
Thus each document representation is generated 
completely automatically. Later experiments ex-
plore two alternative indexing strategies. 
4.1 Comparison of Term Weighting Schemes 
The CLEF 2005 CL-SR collection is quite small by 
IR standards, and it is well known that collection 
size matters when selecting term weighting schemes 
(Salton and Buckley, 1988).  Moreover, the docu-
ments in this case are relatively short, averaging 
about 500 words (about 4 minutes of speech), and 
that factor may affect the optimal choice of weight-
ing schemes as well.  We therefore used the training 
topics to explore the space of available SMART 
term weighting schemes.  Table 1 presents results 
for various weighting schemes with  English topics. 
There are 3,600 possible combinations of weighting 
schemes available: 60 schemes (5 x 4 x 3) for 
documents and 60 for queries. We tested a total of 
240 combinations. In Table 1 we present the results 
for 15 combinations (the best ones, plus some oth-
ers to illustate  the diversity of the results). mpc.ntn 
is still the best for the test topic set; but, as shown, a 
few other weighting schemes achieve similar per-
formance. Some of the weighting schemes perform 
better when indexing all the topic fields (TDN), 
some on TD, and some on title only (T). npn.ntn 
was best for TD and lsn.ntn and lsn.atn are best for 
T. The mpc.ntn weighting scheme is used for all 
other experiments in this section.  We are investi-
gating the reasons for the effectiveness of this 
weighting scheme in our experiments.

4.2 Cross-Language Experiments 
Table 2 shows our results for the merged ASR, 
AK1 and AK2 documents with multi-system topic 
translations for French, German and Spanish, and 
single-system Czech translation. We can see that 
Spanish topics perform well compared to monolin-
gual English. However, results for German and 
Czech are much poorer. This is perhaps not surpris-
ing for the Czech topics where only a single transla-
tion is available. For German, the quality of 
translation was sometimes low and some German 
words were retained untranslated. For French, only 
TD topic fields were available.  In this case we can 
see that cross-language retrieval effectiveness is 
almost identical to monolingual English. Every re-
search team participating in the CLEF 2005 CL-SR 
task submitted at least one TD English run, and 
among those our mpc.ntn system yielded the best 
MAP (Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired sam-
ples, p<0.05). However, as we show in Table 4, 
manual metadata can yield better retrieval effec-
tiveness than automatic description.

4.3 Results on Phonetic Transcriptions 
In Table 3 we present results for an experiment 
where the text of the collection and topics, without 
stemming, is transformed into a phonetic transcrip-
tion. Consecutive phones are then grouped into 
overlapping n-gram sequences (groups of n sounds, 
n=4 in our case) that we used for indexing. The 
phonetic n-grams were provided by Clarke (2005), 
using NIST?s text-to-phone tool1. For example, the 
phonetic form for the query fragment child survi-
vors is: ch_ay_l_d s_ax_r_v ax_r_v_ay r_v_ay_v 
v_ay_v_ax ay_v_ax_r v_ax_r_z. 
The phonetic form helps compensate for the 
speech recognition errors. With TD queries, the re-
sults improve substantially compared with the text 
form of the documents and queries (9% relative). 
Combining phonetic and text forms (by simply in-
dexing both phonetic n-grams and text) yields little 
additional improvement. 
4.4 Manual summaries and keywords 
Manually prepared transcripts are not available 
for this test collection, so we chose to use manually 
assigned metadata as a reference condition.  To ex-
plore the effect of merging automatic and manual 
fields, Table 4 presents the results combining man-

ual keywords and manual summaries with ASR 
transcripts, AK1, and AK2. Retrieval effectiveness 
increased substantially for all topic languages. The 
MAP score improved with 25% relative when add-
ing the manual metadata for English TDN.  
Table 4 also shows comparative results between 
and our results and results reported by the Univer-
sity of Maryland at CLEF 2005 using a widely used 
IR system (InQuery) that has a standard term 
weighting algorithm optimized for large collections. 
For English TD, our system is 6% (relative) better 
and for French TD 10% (relative) better.  The Uni-
versity of Maryland results with only automated 
fields are also lower than the results we report in 
Table 2 for the same fields.

5 Conclusions and Further Investigation 
The system described in this paper obtained the best 
results among the seven teams that participated in 
the CLEF 2005 CL-SR track. We believe that this 
results from our use of the 38 training topics to find 
a term weighting scheme that is particularly suitable 
for this collection. Relevance judgments are typi-
cally not available for training until the second year 
of an IR evaluation; using a search-guided process 
that does not require system results to be available 
before judgments can be performed made it possi-
ble to accelerate that timetable in this case.  Table 2 
shows that performance varies markedly with the 
choice of weighting scheme.  Indeed, some of the 
classic weighting schemes yielded much poorer 
results than the one  we ultimately selected. In this 
paper we presented results on the test queries, but 
we observed similar effects on the training queries. 
On combined manual and automatic data, the 
best MAP score we obtained for English topics is 
0.4647. On automatic data, the best MAP is 0.2176. 
This difference could result from ASR errors or 
from terms added by human indexers that were not 
available to the ASR system to be recognized. In 
future work we plan to investigate methods of re-
moving or correcting some of the speech recogni-
tion errors in the ASR transcripts using semantic 
coherence measures. 
In ongoing further work we are exploring the re-
lationship between properties of the collection and 
the weighting schemes in order to better understand 
the underlying reasons for the demonstrated effec-
tiveness of the mpc.ntn weighting scheme.  
The challenges of CLEF CL-SR task will con-
tinue to expand in subsequent years as new collec-
tions are introduced (e.g., Czech interviews in 
2006). Because manually assigned segment bounda-
ries are available only for English interviews, this 
will yield an unknown topic boundary condition 
that is similar to previous experiments with auto-
matically transcribed broadcast news the Text Re-
trieval Conference (Garafolo et al 2000), but with 
the additional caveat that topic boundaries are not 
known for the ground truth relevance judgments.
