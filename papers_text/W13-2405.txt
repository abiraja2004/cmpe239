Abstract
Frequently asked questions (FAQ) are an
efficient way of communicating domain-
specific information to the users. Unlike
general purpose retrieval engines, FAQ re-
trieval engines have to address the lexi-
cal gap between the query and the usu-
ally short answer. In this paper we de-
scribe the design and evaluation of a FAQ
retrieval engine for Croatian. We frame
the task as a binary classification prob-
lem, and train a model to classify each
FAQ as either relevant or not relevant for
a given query. We use a variety of se-
mantic textual similarity features, includ-
ing term overlap and vector space features.
We train and evaluate on a FAQ test col-
lection built specifically for this purpose.
Our best-performing model reaches 0.47
of mean reciprocal rank, i.e., on average
ranks the relevant answer among the top
two returned answers.
1 Introduction
The amount of information available online is
growing at an exponential rate. It is becoming in-
creasingly difficult to navigate the vast amounts
of data and isolate relevant pieces of informa-
tion. Thus, providing efficient information access
for clients can be essential for many businesses.
Frequently asked questions (FAQ) databases are a
popular way to present domain-specific informa-
tion in the form of expert answers to users ques-
tions. Each FAQ consists of a question and an
answer, possibly complemented with additional
metadata (e.g., keywords). A FAQ retrieval engine
provides an interface to a FAQ database. Given a
user query in natural language as input, it retrieves
a ranked list of FAQs relevant to the query.
FAQ retrieval can be considered half way be-
tween traditional document retrieval and question
answering (QA). Unlike in full-blown QA, in FAQ
retrieval the questions and the answers are already
extracted. On the other hand, unlike in document
retrieval, FAQ queries are typically questions and
the answers are typically much shorter than doc-
uments. While FAQ retrieval can be approached
using simple keyword matching, the performance
of such systems will be severely limited due to the
lexical gap ? a lack of overlap between the words
that appear in a query and words from a FAQ pair.
As noted by Sneiders (1999), there are two causes
for this. Firstly, the FAQ database creators in gen-
eral do not know the user questions in advance.
Instead, they must guess what the likely questions
would be. Thus, it is very common that users? in-
formation needs are not fully covered by the pro-
vided questions. Secondly, both FAQs and user
queries are generally very short texts, which di-
minishes the chances of a keyword match.
In this paper we describe the design and the
evaluation of a FAQ retrieval engine for Croat-
ian. To address the lexical gap problem, we take
a supervised learning approach and train a model
that predicts the relevance of a FAQ given a query.
Motivated by the recent work on semantic textual
similarity (Agirre et al, 2012), we use as model
features a series of similarity measures based on
word overlap and semantic vector space similar-
ity. We train and evaluate the model on a FAQ
dataset from a telecommunication domain. On this
dataset, our best performing model achieves 0.47
of mean reciprocal rank, i.e., on average ranks the
relevant FAQ among the top two results.
In summary, the contribution of this paper is
twofold. Firstly, we propose and evaluate a
FAQ retrieval model based on supervised machine
learning. To the best of our knowledge, no previ-
24
ous work exists that addresses IR for Croatian in
a supervised setting. Secondly, we build a freely
available FAQ test collection with relevance judg-
ments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first IR test collection for Croatian.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In the next section we give an overview of related
work. In Section 3 we describe the FAQ test col-
lection, while in Section 4 we describe the retrieval
model. Experimental evaluation is given in Sec-
tion 5. Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines
future work.
2 Related Work
Most prior work on FAQ retrieval has focused on
the problem of lexical gap, and various approaches
have been proposed for bridging it. Early work,
such as Sneiders (1999), propose to manually en-
rich the FAQ databases with additional meta data
such as the required, optional, and forbidden key-
words and keyphrases. This effectively reduces
FAQ retrieval to simple keyword matching, how-
ever in this case it is the manually assigned meta-
data that bridges the lexical gap and provides the
look and feel of semantic search.
For anything but a small-sized FAQ database,
manual creation of metadata is tedious and cost
intensive, and in addition requires expert knowl-
edge. An alternative is to rely on general lin-
guistic resources. FAQ finder (Burke et al, 1997)
uses syntax analysis to identify phrases, and then
performs matching using shallow lexical semantic
knowledge from WordNet (Miller, 1995). Yet an-
other way to bridge the lexical gap is smoothing
via clustering, proposed by Kim and Seo (2006).
First, query logs are expanded with word defini-
tions from a machine readable dictionary. Subse-
quently, query logs are clustered, and query simi-
larity is computed against the clusters, instead of
against the individual FAQs. As an alternative to
clustering, query expansion is often used to per-
form lexical smoothing (Voorhees, 1994; Navigli
and Velardi, 2003).
In some domains a FAQ engine additionally
must deal with typing errors and noisy user-
generated content. An example is the FAQ re-
trieval for SMS messages, described by Kothari et
al. (2009) and Contractor et al (2010).
Although low lexical overlap is identified as
the primary problem in FAQ retrieval, sometimes
it is the high lexical overlap that also presents a
problem. This is particularly true for large FAQ
databases in which a non-relevant document can
?accidentally? have a high lexical overlap with
a query. Moreo et al (2012) address the prob-
lem of false positives using case based reason-
ing. Rather than considering only the words, they
use phrases (?differentiator expressions?) that dis-
criminate well between FAQs.
The approaches described so far are essentially
unsupervised. A number of supervised FAQ re-
trieval methods have been described in the litera-
ture. To bridge the lexical gap, Xue et al (2008)
use machine translation models to ?translate? the
user query into a FAQ. Their system is trained on
very large FAQ knowledge bases, such as Yahoo
answers. Soricut and Brill (2004) describe another
large-scale FAQ retrieval system, which uses lan-
guage and transformation models. A good gen-
eral overview of supervised approaches to ranking
tasks is the work by Liu (2009).
Our system falls into the category of supervised
methods. In contrast to the above-described ap-
proaches, we use a supervised model with word
overlap and semantic similarity features. Taking
into account that FAQs are short texts, we use fea-
tures that have been recently proposed for deter-
mining the semantic similarity between pairs of
sentences (?aric? et al, 2012). Because we train
our model to output a relevance score for each
document, our approach is essentially a pointwise
learning-to-rank approach (Qin et al, 2008).
3 Croatian FAQ test collection
The standard procedure for IR evaluation requires
a test collection consisting of documents, queries,
and relevance judgments. We additionally require
an annotated dataset to train the model. As there
currently exists no standard IR test collection for
Croatian, we decided to build a FAQ test collec-
tion from scratch. We use this collection for both
model training and retrieval evaluation.
To obtain a FAQ test collection, we crawled the
web FAQ of Vip,1 a Croatian mobile phone opera-
tor. For each FAQ, we retrieved both the question
and the answer. In the Vip FAQ database ques-
tions are categorized into several broad categories
(e.g., by type of service). For each FAQ, we also
extract the category name assigned to it. We ob-
tained a total of 1344 FAQs. After removing the

Table 1: Examples of relevant answers to queries from the dataset
duplicates, 1222 unique FAQ pairs remain.
Next, we asked ten annotators to create at least
twelve queries each. They were instructed to in-
vent queries that they think would be asked by real
users of Vip services. To ensure that the queries
are as original as possible, the annotators were not
shown the original FAQ database. Following Lyti-
nen and Tomuro (2002), after creating the queries,
the annotators were instructed to rephrase them.
We asked the annotators to make between three
and ten paraphrases of each query. The paraphrase
strategies suggested were the following: (1) turn a
query into a multi-sentence query, (2) change the
structure (syntax) of the query, (3) substitute some
words with synonyms, while leaving the structure
intact, (4) turn the query into a declarative sen-
tence, and (5) any combination of the above. The
importance of not changing the underlying mean-
ing of a query was particularly stressed.
The next step was to obtain the binary relevance
judgments for each query. Annotating relevance
for the complete FAQ database is not feasible, as
the total number of query-FAQ pairs is too large.
On the other hand, not considering some of the
FAQs would make it impossible to estimate re-
call. A feasible alternative is the standard pooling
method predominantly used in IR evaluation cam-
paigns (Voorhees, 2002). In the pooling method,
the top-k ranked results of each evaluated system
are combined into a single list, which is then an-
notated for relevance judgments. For a sufficiently
large k, the recall estimate will be close to real
recall, as the documents that are not in the pool
are likely to be non-relevant. We simulate this set-
ting using several standard retrieval models: key-
word search, phrase search, tf-idf, and language
modeling. The number of combined results per
query is between 50 and 150. To reduce the an-
notators? bias towards top-ranked examples, the
retrieved results were presented in random order.
For each query, the annotators gave binary judg-
ments (?relevant? or ?not relevant?) to each FAQ
from the pooled list; FAQs not in the pool are as-
sumed to be not relevant. Although the appropri-
ateness of binary relevance has been questioned
(e.g., by Kek?l?inen (2005)), it is still commonly
used for FAQ and QA collections (Wu et al, 2006;
Voorhees and Tice, 2000). Table 1 shows exam-
ples of queries and relevant FAQs.
The above procedure yields a set of pairs
(Qr, Frel ), where Qr is a set of query paraphrases
and Frel is the set of relevant FAQs for any query
paraphrase from Qr. The total number of such
pairs is 117. From this set we generate a set of
pairs (q, Frel ), where q ? Qr is a single query.
The total number of such pairs is 419, of which
327 have at least one answer (Frel 6= ?), while
92 are not answered (Frel = ?). In this work
we focus on optimizing the performance on an-
swered queries and leave the detection and han-
dling of unanswered queries for future work. The
average number of relevant FAQs for a query is
1.26, while on average each FAQ is relevant for
1.44 queries. Test collection statistics is shown in
Table 2. We make the test collection freely avail-
able for research purposes.2
For further processing, we lemmatized the
query and FAQ texts using the morphological lex-
icon from ?najder et al (2008). We removed the
stopwords using a list of 179 Croatian stopwords.

4 Retrieval model
The task of the retrieval model is to rank the FAQs
by relevance to a given query. In an ideal case,
the relevant FAQs will be ranked above the non-
relevant ones. The retrieval model we propose is
a confidence-rated classifier trained on binary rel-
evance judgments, which uses as features the se-
mantic textual similarity between the query and
the FAQ. For a given a query-FAQ pair, the clas-
sifier outputs whether the FAQ is relevant (posi-
tive) or irrelevant (negative) for the query. More
precisely, the classifier outputs a confidence score,
which can be interpreted as the degree of rele-
vance. Given a single query as input, we run the
classifier on all query-FAQ pairs to obtain the con-
fidence scores for all FAQs from the database. We
then use these confidence scores to produce the fi-
nal FAQ ranking.
The training set consists of pairs (q, f) from the
test collection, where q ? Qr is a query from
the set of paraphrase queries and f ? Frel is a
FAQ from the set of relevant FAQs for this query
(cf. Section 3). Each (q, f) pair represents a posi-
tive training instance. To create a negative training
instance, we randomly select a (q, f) pair from the
set of positive instances and substitute the relevant
FAQ f with a randomly chosen non-relevant FAQ
f ?. As generating all possible negative instances
would give a very imbalanced dataset, we chose to
generate only 2N negative instances, where N is
the number of positive instances. Because |Frel|
varies depending on query q, number of instances
N per query also varies; on average, N is 329.
To train the classifier, we compute a feature vec-
tor for each (q, f) instance. The features measure
the semantic textual similarity between q and f .
More precisely, the features measure (1) the sim-
ilarity between query q and the question from f
and (2) the similarity between query q and the an-
swer from f . Considering both FAQ question and
answer has proven to be beneficial (Tomuro and
Lytinen, 2004). Additionally, ngram overlap fea-
tures are computed between the query and FAQ
category name.
As the classification model, we use the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis kernel.
We use the LIBSVM implementation from Chang
and Lin (2011).
4.1 Term overlap features
We expect that FAQ relevance to be positively cor-
related with lexical overlap between FAQ text and
the user query. We use several lexical overlap
features. Similar features have been proposed by
Michel et al (2011) for paraphrase classification
and by ?aric? et al (2012) for semantic textual sim-
ilarity.
Ngram overlap (NGO). Let T1 and T2 be the
sets of consecutive ngrams (e.g., bigrams) in the
first and the second text, respectively. NGO is de-
fined as
ngo(T1, T2) = 2?
(
|T1|
|T1 ? T2|
+
|T2|
|T1 ? T2|
)?1
(1)
NGO measures the degree to which the first text
covers the second and vice versa. The two scores
are combined via a harmonic mean. We compute
NGO for unigrams and bigrams.
IC weighted word overlap (ICNGO). NGO
gives equal importance to all words. In practice,
we expect some words to be more informative than
others. The informativeness of a word can be mea-
sured by its information content (Resnik, 1995),
defined as
ic(w) = ln
?
w??C freq(w
?
)
freq(w)
(2)
where C is the set of words from the corpus and
freq(w) is the frequency of word w in the corpus.
We use the HRWAC corpus from Ljube?ic? and Er-
javec (2011) to obtain the word counts.
Let S1 and S2 be the sets of words occurring
in the first and second text, respectively. The IC-
weighted word coverage of the second text by the
first text is given by
wwc(S1, S2) =
?
w?S1?S2 ic(w)?
w??S2
ic(w?)
(3)
We compute the ICNGO feature as the harmonic
mean of wwc(S1, S2) and wwc(S2, S1).
27
4.2 Vector space features
Tf-idf similarity (TFIDF). The tf-idf (term fre-
quency/inverse document frequency) similarity of
two texts is computed as the cosine similarity of
their tf-idf weighted bag-of-words vectors. The tf-
idf weights are computed on the FAQ test collec-
tion. Here we treat each FAQ (without distinction
between question, answer, and category parts) as a
single document.
LSA semantic similarity (LSA). Latent seman-
tic analysis (LSA), first introduced by Deerwester
et al (1990), has been shown to be very effective
for computing word and document similarity. To
build the LSA model, we proceed along the lines
of Karan et al (2012). We build the model from
Croatian web corpus HrWaC from Ljube?ic? and
Erjavec (2011). For lemmatization, we use the
morphological lexicon from ?najder et al (2008).
Prior to the SVD, we weight the matrix elements
with their tf-idf values. Preliminary experiments
showed that system performance remained satis-
factory when reducing the vector space to only 25
dimensions, but further reduction caused deterio-
ration. We use 25 dimensions in all experiments.
LSA represents the meaning of a w by a vector
v(w). Motivated by work on distributional seman-
tic compositionality (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008),
we compute the semantic representation of text T
as the semantic composition (defined as vector ad-
dition) of the individual words constituting T :
v(T ) =
?
w?T
v(w) (4)
We compute the similarity between texts T1 and
T2 as the cosine between v(T1) and v(T2).
IC weighted LSA similarity (ICLSA). In the
LSA similarity feature all words occurring in a text
are considered to be equally important when con-
structing the compositional vector, ignoring the
fact that some words are more informative than
others. To acknowledge this, we use information
content weights defined by (2) and compute the IC
weighted compositional vector of a text T as
c(T ) =
?
wi?T
ic(wi)v(wi) (5)
Aligned lemma overlap (ALO). This feature
measures the similarity of two texts by semanti-
cally aligning their words in a greedy fashion. To
compare texts T1 and T2, first all pairwise sim-
ilarities between words from T1 and words from
T2 are computed. Then, the most similar pair is
selected and removed from the list. The procedure
is repeated until all words are aligned. The aligned
pairs are weighted by the larger information con-
tent of the two words:
sim(w1, w2) = (6)
max(ic(w1), ic(w2))? ssim(w1, w2)
where ssim(w1, w2) is the semantic similarity of
words w1 and w2 computed as the cosine similar-
ity of their LSA vectors, and ic is the information
content given by (2). The overall similarity be-
tween two texts is defined as the sum of weighted
pair similarities, normalized by the length of the
longer text:
alo(T1, T2) =
?
(w1,w2)?P sim(w1, w2)
max(length(T1), length(T2))
(7)
where P is the set of aligned lemma pairs. A sim-
ilar measure is proposed by Lavie and Denkowski
(2009) for machine translation evaluation, and has
been found out to work well for semantic textual
similarity (?aric? et al, 2012).
4.3 Question type classification (QC)
Related work on QA (Lytinen and Tomuro, 2002)
shows that the accuracy of QA systems can be im-
proved by question type classification. The intu-
ition behind this is that different types of ques-
tions demand different types of answers. Conse-
quently, information about the type of answer re-
quired should be beneficial as a feature.
To explore this line of improvement, we train
a simple question classifier on a dataset from
Lombarovic? et al (2011). The dataset consists
of 1300 questions in Croatian, classified into six
classes: numeric, entity, human, description, lo-
cation, and abbreviation. Following Lombarovic?
et al (2011), we use document frequency to select
the most frequent 300 words and 600 bigrams to
use as features. An SVM trained on this dataset
achieves 80.16% accuracy in a five-fold cross-
validation. This is slightly worse than the best re-
sult from Lombarovic? et al (2011), however we
use a smaller set of lexical features. We use the
question type classifier to compute two features:
the question type of the query and the question
type of FAQ question.

4.4 Query expansion dictionary (QED)
Our error analysis revealed that some false nega-
tives could easily be eliminated by expanding the
query with similar/related words. To this end, we
constructed a small, domain-specific query expan-
sion dictionary. We aimed to (1) mitigate minor
spelling variances, (2) make the high similarity of
some some cross-POS or domain-specific words
explicit, and (3) introduce a rudimentary ?world
knowledge? useful for the domain at hand. The fi-
nal dictionary contains 53 entries; Table 3 shows
some examples.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Experimental setup
Because our retrieval model is supervised, we
evaluate it using five-fold cross-validation on the
FAQ test collection. In each fold we train our sys-
tem on the training data as described in Section
4, and evaluate the retrieval performance on the
queries from the test set. While each (q, Frel) oc-
curs in the test set exactly once, the same FAQ may
occur in both the train and test set. Note that this
does not pose a problem because the query part of
the pair will differ (due to paraphrasing).
To gain a better understanding of which features
contribute the most to retrieval performance, we
created several models. The models use increas-
ingly complex feature sets; an overview is given
in Table 4. We leave exhaustive feature analysis
and selection for future work.
As a baseline to compare against, we use a stan-
dard tf-idf weighted retrieval model. This model
ranks the FAQs by the cosine similarity of tf-idf
weighted vectors representing the query and the
FAQ. When computing the vector of the FAQ pair,
the question, answer, and category name are con-
catenated into a single text unit.

Table 5: Classification results
5.2 Results
Relevance classification performance. Recall
that we use a binary classifier as a retrieval model.
The performance of this classifier directly deter-
mines the performance of the retrieval system as a
whole. It is therefore interesting to evaluate clas-
sifier performance separately. To generate the test
set, in each of the five folds we sample from the
test set the query-FAQ instances using the proce-
dure described in Section 4 (N positive and 2N
negative instance).
Precision, recall, and F1-score for each model
are shown in Table 5. Model RM4 outperforms
the other considered models. Model RM5, which
additionally uses question type classification, per-
forms worse than RM4, suggesting that the ac-
curacy of question type classification is not suf-
ficiently high. Our analysis of the test collection
revealed that this can be attributed to a domain
mismatch: the questions (mobile phone opera-
tor FAQ) are considerably different than those on
which the question classifier was trained (factoid
general questions). Moreover, some of the queries
and questions in our FAQ test collection are not
questions at all (cf. Table 2); e.g., ?Popravak mo-
bitela.? (?Mobile phone repair.?). Consequently,
it is not surprising that question classification fea-
tures do not improve the performance.
Retrieval performance. Retrieval results of the
five considered models are given in Table 6. We
report the standard IR evaluation measures: mean
reciprocal rank (MRR), average precision (AP),
and R-precision (RP). The best performance was
obtained with RM4 model, which uses all features
except the question type. The best MRR result
of 0.479 (with standard deviation over five folds
of ?0.04) indicates that, on average, model RM4
ranks the relevant answer among top two results.
Performance of other models expectedly in-
crease with the complexity of features used. How-
ever, RM5 is again an exception, performing
worse than RM4 despite using additional question

Expectedly, classification performance and
retrieval performance are positively correlated
(cf. Tables 5 and 6). A noteworthy case is RM4,
which improves the F1-score by only 5% over
RM3, yet improves IR measures by more than
10%. This suggest that, in addition to improving
the classifier decisions, the QED boosts the confi-
dence scores of already correct decisions.
A caveat to the above analysis is the fact that
the query expansion dictionary was constructed
base on the cross-validation result. While only
a small amount of errors were corrected with the
dictionary, this still makes models RM4 and RM5
slightly biased to the given dataset. An objective
estimate of maximum performance on unseen data
is probably somewhere between RM3 and RM4.
5.3 Error analysis
By manual inspection of false positive and false
negative errors, we have identified several char-
acteristic cases that account for the majority of
highly ranked irrelevant documents.
Lexical interference. While a query does have
a significant lexical similarity with relevant FAQ
pairs, it also has (often accidental) lexical simi-
larity with irrelevant FAQs. Because the classifier
appears to prefer lexical overlap, such irrelevant
FAQs interfere with results by taking over some of
the top ranked positions from relevant pairs.
Lexical gap. Some queries ask a very similar
question to an existing FAQ from the database, but
paraphrase it in such a way that almost no lexical
overlap remains. Even though the effect of this is
partly mitigated by our semantic vector space fea-
tures, in extreme cases the relevant FAQs will be
ranked rather low.
Semantic gap. Taken to the extreme, a para-
phrase can change a query to the extent that it
not only introduces a lexical gap, but also a se-
mantic gap, whose bridging would require logi-
cal inference and world knowledge. An exam-
ple of such query is ?Postoji li moguc?nost ko-
ri?tenja Vip kartice u Australiji?? (?Is it possi-
ble to use Vip sim card in Australia??). The asso-
ciated FAQ question is ?Kako mogu saznati pos-
toji li GPRS/EDGE ili UMTS/HSDPA roaming u
zemlji u koju putujem?? (?How can I find out if
there is GPRS/EDGE or UMTS/SPA roaming in
the country to which I am going??).
Word matching errors. In some cases words
which should match do not. This is most often
the case when one of the words is missing from
the morphological lexicon, and thus not lemma-
tized. A case in point is the word ?Facebook?, or
its colloquial Croatian variants ?fejs? and ?face?,
along with their inflected forms. Handling this is
especially important because a significant number
of FAQs from our dataset contain such words. An
obvious solution would be to complement lemma-
tization with stemming.
5.4 Cutoff strategies
Our model outputs a list of all FAQs from the
database, ranked by relevance to the input query.
As low-ranked FAQs are mostly not relevant, pre-
senting the whole ranked list puts an unnecessary
burden on the user. We therefore explored some
strategies for limiting the number of results.
First N (FN). This simply returns the N best
ranked documents.
Measure threshold criterion (MTC). We define
a threshold on FAQ relevance score, and re-
30

retrieved (for various cutoff strategies)
turn only the FAQs for which the classifier
confidence is above a specified threshold.
Cumulative threshold criterion (CTC). We de-
fine a threshold for cumulative relevance
score. The top-ranked FAQs for which the
sum of classifier confidences is below the
threshold are returned.
Relative threshold criterion (RTC). Returns all
FAQs whose relevance is within the given
percentage of the top-ranked FAQ relevance.
A good cutoff strategy should on average re-
turn a smaller number of documents, while still re-
taining high recall. To reflect this requirement we
measure the recall vs. average number of retrieved
documents (Fig. 1). While there is no substantial
difference between the four strategies, MTC and
RTC perform similarly and slightly better than FN
and CTC. As the number of documents increases,
the differences between the different cutoff strate-
gies diminish.
5.5 Performance and scalability
We have implemented the FAQ engine using in-
house code in Java. The only external library used
is the Java version of LIBSVM. Regarding system
performance, the main bottleneck is in generating
the features. Since all features depend on the user
query, they cannot be precomputed. Computation-
ally most intensive feature is ALO (cf. Section
4.2), which requires computing a large number of
vector cosines.
The response time of our FAQ engine is accept-
able ? on our 1222 FAQs test collection, the re-
sults are retrieved within one second. However, to
retrieve the results, the engine must generate fea-
tures and apply a classifier to every FAQ from the
database. This makes the response time linearly
dependent on the number of FAQs. For larger
databases, a preprocessing step to narrow down
the scope of the search would be required. To this
end, we could use a standard keyword-based re-
trieval engine, optimized for high recall. Unfortu-
nately, improving efficiency by precomputing the
features is impossible because it would require the
query to be known in advance.
6 Conclusion and Perspectives
We have described a FAQ retrieval engine for
Croatian. The engine uses a supervised retrieval
model trained on a FAQ test collection with bi-
nary relevance judgments. To bridge the notorious
lexical gap problem, we have employed a series of
features based on semantic textual similarity be-
tween the query and the FAQ. We have built a FAQ
test collection on which we have trained and evalu-
ated the model. On this test collection, our model
achieves a very good performance with an MRR
score of 0.47.
We discussed a number of open problems. Er-
ror analysis suggests that our models prefer the
lexical overlap features. Consequently, most er-
rors are caused by deceivingly high or low word
overlap. One way to address the former is to con-
sider not only words themselves, but also syntactic
structures. A simple way to do this is to use POS
patterns to detect similar syntactic structures. A
more sophisticated version could make use of de-
pendency relations obtained by syntactic parsing.
We have demonstrated that even a small,
domain-specific query expansion dictionary can
provide a considerable performance boost. An-
other venue of research could consider the auto-
matic methods for constructing a domain-specific
query expansion dictionary. As noted by a re-
viewer, one possibility would be to mine query
logs collected over a longer period of time, as em-
ployed in web search (Cui et al, 2002) and also
FAQ retrieval (Kim and Seo, 2006).
From a practical perspective, future work shall
focus on scaling up the system to large FAQ
databases and multi-user environments.
