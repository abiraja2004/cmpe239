l, Background and Introduction 
This paper discusses tile role of disconrse in expository text; text 
which typically comprises published scholarly papers, textbooks, proceed- 
ings of conferences, and other highly stylized documents. Our purpose is 
to examine the extent to which those discourse-related phenomena that 
generally assist the analysis of dialogue text -- where speaker, hearer, and 
speech-act information are more actively inwllved in the identification of 
plans and goals - can be used to help with the analysis of expository text. 
In particular, we make the optimistic assmnption that expository text is 
strongly connected; i.e., that all adjacent pairs of clauses in such a text 
are connected by 'cohesion markers,'  both explicit and implicit. We 
investigate the impact that this assmnption may have on the depth of 
understanding that can be achieved, rite nnderlying semantic structures, 
aud the supporting lcnowledge base for the analysis. An application of this 
work in designin~g the M-based machine translation mdel, TRANSLA- 
TOR, is discussed in NIRENBURG ET AL (1986) which appears else- 
where in this volume. 
When we read all expository text, our intuition relies on some basic 
assumptions about its coherence. That is, we normally expect he series 
of concepts to flow naturally from one sentence to the next. Moreover, 
when a conceptual discontinuity ocmn's at some point within the text, we 
are sometimes given all explicit syntactic lue (like. 'on the other hand') 
that such will occnr. More often, however, we are not given snch a nine, 
we are expected to automatically detect his shift of focus without requiring 
, any explicit prompting. 
Most of the research in tile field of discourse analysis uses texts 
which are dialogues; two or more people are involved, speaker and hearer 
roles are constantly changing, and speech-act (speaker's intention) infer- 
marion is a changing and essential factor in tile semantics of the dialogue. 
For instance, extensive work has been published by LONGRACE (1977), 
PHILLIPS (1977), REICHMAN (1984, 1985), JOSHI ET AL. (1981), 
and GRIMES (1978). Although expository text does not typically contain 
dialogues, techniques of discourse analysis appears nevertheless to contri- 
bute strongly to the 
Another area of research that directly bears upon the present prob 
lem is the notion of textual coherence. According to HOBBS (1976), an 
utterance is coherent if it is an action within the implementation of some 
plan. In particular, conversation may be characterized as all expression 
of planned behavior with goals, and is thus coherent in this sense. Hobbs 
describes four classes of coherent conversational moves that can occur in 
a dialogue: Occasion (cause or enablement), Evaluation, Explanation, and 
Expansion. In each of these moves, the speaker's goat is to manipulate 
the inference process of the hearer, so that tile latter links what he/she 
already knows with what is new in the message. We shall illustrate that 
tile same premise can serve as a starting point for identifying and charac- 
terizing coherence in an expository text. 
2. Overview of TRANSLATOR 
TRANSLATOR is file name given to an ongoing research project at 
Colgate University which attempts to define a basis for muttilingual 
machine translation by using a universal intermediate metalanguage, or
'interliugua,' at iis heart. The idea is to design an interlingua which is 
robust enough to represent sufficient syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic 
knowledge about a text in any source language, so that its translation into 
a different arget language can proceed independently of the original text. 
A more thorough introduction to TRANSI.ATOR can be found th 
TUCKER AND NIRENBURG (1984) and NIRENBURG ET AL (1986).

In this paper', we limit ourselves to exploring those discourse-related 
phenomena which appear ill expository text, and suggesting how these 
phenomena may be captured uring the analysis of a text and represented 
in tile intertingua itself. To support his exploration, we use those parts of 
tile interlingua for TRANSLATOR which are relevant to discourse 
mmlysis, and identify their rote in the analysis process. The use of italics 
in the paragraphs below denotes a concept which has a precise definition 
and connotation within iuterlingoa itself. 
An interlingua text may be either a single interlingua sentence or a 
series of sentences connected by discourse operators d. More formally: 
text :: = sentence  \[ 
d (text text) 
The discourse operators d are enumerated and briefly described below; 
their' meanings are more fully described in a later section.

-I simiI continuation of same topic

-expan generalization

condi conditional (cause or enablement) 
compare compa rison

An interlingua sentence is con\]posed of a series of clauses, together with 
its own characteristic subworld, modality, focus, and speech-act thfbrma- 
tion. 
Witltottt going into fro'thor detail \[see NIRENBURG ET At. (1986) 
for filrther description\], we note that this representation abandons tile 
traditional phrase-structure, dependency or other pnrely syntactic basis for 
representation, i  favor of a far deeper level of representation for rnecharl- 
ical understanding. 
3. Focus Shift ill F, xpository Text 
In expository text, the speaker and hearer roles are more or less 
permanendy assigned to the author and the reader, respectively. Tile 
exposition is permanently under the control of the author, add the reader 
plays a more or less passive role throughout. Still, speech act information 
plays a role in this setting, in the following ways: 
Definitions, as in 'Data that i,; stored more or less permanently in a 
computer we term a database. "
Opinions, as in 'We agree with the point of view that software 
piracy is illegal.' 
Facts, as in 'The Symbolics LISP machine can have up to 8 mega- 
bytes of memory.'  
Promises, as ill 'We shall explain this subject more fully in Chapter 
8.' 
Advice, as in ' I f  you are not interested in the theoretical foundations 
of database management systems, you may wish to skip the next sec- 
tion.' 
Questions, as in 'What is the tradeoff between flexibility and effi- 
ciency in comparing the relational and hierarchical database 
models?' 
Commands, as in 'You should answer the following questions 
before proceeding to Chapter 2.' 
Some of these speech acts are directly related to tile topic under discus- 
sion, while others serve only to guide the reader through his/her planning 
and goal-setting activities while reading the text. 
Tile identification of focus shift is enabled by both the underlying 
knowledge base and the discourse-related phenomena that appear in the 
text itself. At the outset of analysis, the text is viewed as a sequence of 
sentences, made up of clauses, each one containing a single focus, which 
may be either an object or an event. Both objects and events have flame- 
like l'epresentations and are derived from information stored in an under- 
lying knowledge base. Tile knowledge base is assumed to be structured, 
so that relationships among specific kinds of objects and events are 
181 
revealed. These include, for instance, ' isa,'  'part-of, '  be-agent-of,' and 
other links that tend to explain how primitive and compound events and 
objects are interrelated in the world. 
A focus shift between adjacent sentences or clauses serves to signal 
the author's attempt to transfer the reader's attention from the given infor- 
mation to the new information that will be added to the presentation. The 
syntactic ontext within which such a shift might take place is arbitrary. 
For instance, consider the following two examples: 
1. The data is shown below. Notice that some values are missing. 
2. When data has missing values, it is called 'sparse'.  
The first shows a shift from the focus 'data' to the focus 'missing values.' 
The second shows a shift from the focus 'data' to the focus 'sparse.'  
These illustrations how that the kind of shift that takes place between two 
adjacent loci in a text may val~j. In the first sentence, the shift was one of 
expansion, while the shift in the second sentence was one of generaliza- 
tion. 
From a strictly syntactic point of view, we see then that focus shift 
can take place regularly between adjacent clauses (sentence 2 above), 
adjacent sentences (sentences 1 above), and larger units of text which are 
adjacent. Thus, the network of focus shifts within a text may be complex. 
4. Defining Discourse Cohesion Relations 
The relations defined below are designed to provide a vehicle expos- 
ing the discourse structure of expository text. These relations are a varia- 
tion of those developed by REICHMAN (1984) and HOBBS (1976); they 
differ because they are especially adapted for use in expository, rather 
than dialogue, types of text. The 'discourse cohesion relations' that can 
exist between two adjacent units of text cl and c2 (which in turn may be 
clauses, sentences, or larger texts) are defined and illustrated as follows: 
TEMPORAL: temp(cl,c2) is true if there is a temporal relationship 
between cl and c2. For instance, the sentences 'It became over- 
cast. It began to rain.'  exhibit a link between the concepts of cloud 
cover and raining, in the sense that one happened before the other. 
CONDITIONAL: condi(cl,c2) is true if cl  either causes or enables 
c2 to occur. For instance, the adjacent sentences 'It began to rain. 
John went indoors.' exhibit a cause-and-effect relationship between 
two conceptual ctions, raining and going indoors. 
EXPANSION: +expan(cl,c2) is true if c2 serves as an example or a 
further explanation of c l .  For instance, the sentences 'The data is 
shown below. Notice that some values are missing.' exhibit this 
conceptual relationship. 
GENERALIZATION: -expan(cl,c2) is true if c2 serves as a gen- 
eralization of c l ,  such as in a definition. In the sentence, 'The 
software that allows a person to use and/or modify this data is called 
a DBMS,' the new concept DBMS is defined for the first time in 
the text, using refinements of another concept 'software' that occur 
through the discourse cohesion relation +expau. That is, if we 
identify 'software' as concept c l ,  'allowing a person to use and/or 
modify data' as concept c2, and 'DBMS'  as concept c3, then we see 
that rite refined concept, say c l ' ,  results from +expan(cl,c2),  and 
the new concept c3 results as from c l '  through generalization; that 
is, -expan(cl' ,c3), or -expan( + expan(cl ,c2),c3). 
CONTRASTIVE: -simil(cl,c2) is true if c2 is either dissimilar or 
opposite from cl .  For instance, consider the sentence, ' In accessing 
a database, the user gives English-like commands rather than 
Pascal-like algorithms.' Let cl denote the concept of 'accessing a 
database,' c2 denote the (refined) concept of 'the user giving 
English-like commands,'  and c3 denote the concept of ' the user giv- 
ing Pascal-like algorithms.' Then we have the contrastive relation 
appearing in the following conceptual refinements: 
c l '=  +expan(cl,c2) and c l "=-expan(c l ' , c3 ) .  That is, c3 serves 
to refine the concept c l '  by providing a counterexample from that 
which was provided in the original refinement of cl  by c2. 
SIMILAR: +simil(cl,c2) is true if c2 is similar, but not explicitly 
identical, to c l .  For example, consider the two sentences, ' One 
role of a DBMS is to provide quick access. That is, we want the 
user to be able to access any item in the database within a few 
seconds of response time.' If we tel these two represent he 
182 
concepts cl and e2, respectively, we see that c2 is an approximately 
identical restatement of c l ,  and so + simil(cl,c2) is true. 
EQUIVALENT: equiv(cl,c2) is true if we can further ascertain that 
c2 is equivalent, or conceptually identical, to c l .  Often this 
equivalence is marked by an explicit sign of synonymy, such as the 
parentheses in the following example. 'The software that allows the 
user to access this data is called a database management system 
(DBMS).' Here, equivalence is marked between the newly-defined 
concept 'database management system' and the acronym DBMS. 
DIGRESSION: none(cl,c2) is true if none of the other relations 
listed above exist between cl and c2. 
5. Inferring Focus Shift and Discourse Relations 
Following the definition of these discourse cohesion classes, it is 
necessary to identify some principles upon which the discourse structure 
may be revealed in the text as analysis progresses from the first sentence 
forward. That is, at any point in the reading of a text, the system must 
understand 'what's going on' in the sense of its discourse structure. 
Letting cl and c2 again denote a pair of items which appear adjacent 
to each other in a text, the following principles can be used to identify 
focus shift, based on the discourse cohesion relations that can occur 
between cl and c2. 
1. If cl is followed by c2 and + expan(cl,e2) is true, then a focus shift 
from cl to c l '  takes place. That is, c1' is an embellishment of cl 
due to the relationship + expan and the supporting concept c2. 
2. Similarly, the relation -simil(cl,c2) yields the focus shift from el to 
the embellishment c l ' .  
3. If cl is followed by c2 and -expan(cl,c2) is true, then the focus 
shift from cl to c2 takes place. That is, cl  relinquishes its role as 
the focus of discourse to c2 by the process of generalization. 
4. Similarly, each one of the relations condi(cl,c2), temp(cl,c2), and 
none(el,c2) yields a..focus hift from cl to c2. 
5. On the other hand, the relations +simil(cl,c2) and equiv(cl,c2) 
cause no shift to take place; that is, cl  remains the focus of 
discourse after e2 has been processed in each case. 
Connectivity between adjacent concepts in a text is sometimes expli- 
citly revealed by the presence of 'clue words' and other markers. The use 
of clue words for discourse analysis is common (eg REICHMAN (1984)). 
The example text discussed in the following section contains everal such 
clue words. Sometimes the marker appears as a punctuation mark (such 
as a parenthetical which signals the relation +equiv), oilier instances 
appear as single words (such as 'However" signaling -simil), while still 
others are complete clauses (such as 'there may be far less' signaling 
+ simil). 
Yet, many instances of conceptual connectivity are not cued by the 
presence of such markers; the are revealed instead by general syntactic 
structure (such as the appearance of a relative clause, signaling +expan) 
or by semantic properties that are possessed by the underlying concepts 
and stored in the knowledge base. The following discussion suggests how 
such knowledge can be used to mark instances of conceptual connectivity 
in expository text. 
Intuitively, some of the conceptual properties that reveal discourse 
cohesion relations are the following: 
Property Connective 
isa -expan 
agent, agent-of + expan 
object, object-of + expan 
patient, patient-of + expan 
tustrument, instrument-of +expau 
source, source-of + expan 
destination, destination-of +expan 
time temp 
space + expau 
effects condi 
Merging these conceptual clues with the explicit syntactic lues for 
discourse connectivity, leads ~ the following table. This table reveals 
some of the clues (both explicit and implici0 that lead to exposure of the 
cohesion relation d(cl c2), where cl attd c2 are adjacent concepts 
(processes or objects) within the text. 
Syntactic lues 
(explicit) 
cl 'then' c2 
'if' c l  'then' c2 
or c l  'caused' c2 
or c l  'enabled' c2 
Conceptual clues Relation 
(implicit) d(cl c2) 
time(cl) precedes time(c2) temp(cl,c2) 
c2 in effects(c I ) condi(c 1,c2) 
c2 in relative c2 in properties(d) +expan(cl ,c2) 
ctause for cl or c2 in links(el) 
or c2 isa(cl) 
cl  ' is '  c2 cl is-part-of(c2) -expan(cl,c2) 
c l .  'However, '  c2 -simil(cl,c2) 
cl 'is like' c2 +simil(cl ,c2) 
c1 (c2) cl = c2 equiv(cl,c2) 
A simple algorithm to infer such relations between pairs of concepts 
in the text, ci atnl cj, can be given. However, space does not permit its 
further elaboration i  this paper. 
6, An Example 
To illustrate the application of these ideas, we have analyzed the five 
sentences of a paragraph taken from the first page of Jeffrey Ullman's 
book, Principles of Database Systems, given below in a specially annotated 
form. The annotations C, S, and D on the left denote clauses, sentences, 
and discourse cohesion markers that are uncovered in a parse of this para- 
graph.

remaining connectives and semantic properties can later be used to expose 
the overall discourse structure of the paragraph. 
7. Conclusion 
We have outlined a basis for modeling semantic onnectivity among 
clauses and sentences in an expository text. Strong notions of discourse 
relations, focus, and an underlying knowledge base are essential to this 
process.
