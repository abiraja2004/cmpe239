Abstract
In Natural Language Processing, negation and modality have mostly been handled
using the older, pre-statistical methodologies of formal representations subject to
rule-based processing. This fits the traditional treatment of negation and modality
in logic-based knowledge representation and linguistics. However, in modern-day
statistics-based NLP, how exactly negation and modality should be taken into ac-
count, and what role these phenomena play overall, is much less clear. The closest
statistics-based NLP gets to semantics at this time is lexical-based word distribu-
tions (such as used in word sense disambiguation) and topic models (such as pro-
duced by Latent Dirichlet Allocation). What exactly in such representations should
a negation or a modality actually apply to? What would, or should, the resulting
effects be? The traditional approaches are of little or no help.
In this talk I argue that neither model is adequate, and that one needs a different
model of semantics to be able to accommodate negation and modality. The tradi-
tional formalisms are impoverished in their absence of an explicit representation
of the denotations of each symbol, and the statistics-based word distributions do
not support the compositionality required of semantics since it is unclear how to
link together two separate word distributions in a semantically meaningful way. A
kind of hybrid, which one could call Distributional Semantics, should be formu-
lated to include the necessary aspects of both: the ability to carry explicit word
associations that are still partitioned so as to allow negation and modality to affect
the representations in intuitively plausible ways is what is required.
I present a specific model of Distributional Semantics that, although still rudi-
mentary, exhibits some of the desired features. I explore the possibilities for ac-
commodating the phenomena of negation and modality. The talk poses many more
questions than it answers and is an invitation to consider Distributional Semantics
as a model for richer and more semantics-oriented statistics-based NLP.
