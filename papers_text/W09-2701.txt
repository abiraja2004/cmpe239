Abstract
Restricted domains such as medicine set
a context where question-answering is
more likely expected to be associated
with knowledge and reasoning (Moll? and
Vicedo, 2007; Ferret and Zweigenbaum,
2007). On the one hand, knowledge and
reasoning may be more necessary than
in open-domain question-answering be-
cause of more specific or more difficult
questions. On the other hand, it may
also be more manageable, since by def-
inition restricted-domain QA should not
have to face the same breadth of ques-
tions as open-domain QA. It is therefore
interesting to study the role of knowl-
edge and reasoning in restricted-domain
question-answering systems. We shall do
so in the case of the (bio-)medical domain,
which has a long tradition of investigat-
ing knowledge representation and reason-
ing and, more generally, artificial intel-
ligence methods (Shortliffe et al, 1975),
and which has seen a growing interest
in question-answering systems (Zweigen-
baum, 2003; Yu et al, 2005; Demner-
Fushman and Lin, 2007; Zweigenbaum et
al., 2007).
1 Knowledge and Reasoning for
Processing Medical Questions
Medical question-answering has to address ques-
tions other than the usual factual questions of most
QA evaluations. This calls for different question
classifications (Ely et al, 2000; Yu et al, 2005),
especially to determine whether a given ques-
tion can be answered using medical knowledge
backed with a sufficient level of evidence (Lin and
Demner-Fushman, 2005; Kilicoglu et al, 2009).
This can also lead to a different representation of
questions, for instance using a structured represen-
tation such as PICO (Niu et al, 2003; Huang et al,
2006; Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007) or simple
concepts and relations (Lin, 2001; Jacquemart and
Zweigenbaum, 2003).
2 Knowledge and Reasoning for Finding
Medical Answers
Answers to medical questions should be searched
in the most reliable data available. When data exist
in structured knowledge bases (e.g. a drug com-
pendium), it may be more appropriate to query
such knowledge bases directly. Therefore an ap-
proach akin to that of Start/Omnibase (Lin and
Katz, 2003) may be indicated. When answers are
to be found in a collection of documents, as is the
case in traditional question-answering systems,
a representation of the information contained in
these documents can be built, offline (Fleischman
et al, 2003; Sang et al, 2005; Delbecque et al,
2005) or dynamically.
In medical QA systems, both document anal-
ysis and question analysis nearly always rely on
extensive knowledge of domain concepts and re-
lations, e.g. as provided by the UMLS knowl-
edge sources (McCray and Nelson, 1995). More
than named entities, systems need to detect men-
tions of concepts (Aronson, 2001) and their rela-
tions (Rindflesch et al, 2005). Besides, taking into
account the structure of documents such as sci-
entific articles or encyclopedia entries may help
focus on more relevant sections (Niu and Hirst,
2004; Sang et al, 2005). Finally, answers to com-
plex medical questions often need to span more
than one sentence. Extractive summarization is
performed both from single documents (Demner-
Fushman and Lin, 2007) and from multiple docu-
ments (Fiszman et al, 2008).
