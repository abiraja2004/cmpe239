Abstract  
TimeML, TimeBank, and TTK (TARSQI 
Project) have been playing an important role 
in enhancement of IE, QA, and other NLP 
applications. TimeML is a specification lan-
guage for events and temporal expressions in 
text. This paper presents the problems and so-
lutions for porting TimeML to Korean as a 
part of the Korean TARSQI Project. We also 
introduce the KTTK which is an automatic 
markup tool of temporal and event-denoting 
expressions in Korean text. 
1 Introduction 
The TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reason-
ing systems for QA) Project 1  aims to develop 
technology for annotation, extraction, and rea-
soning of temporal information in natural lan-
guage text. The main result of the TARSQI Pro-
ject consists of TimeML (Pustejovsky et. al., 
2003), TimeBank (Pustejovsky et. al., 2006), and 
TARSQI Toolkit (TTK, Verhagen and Puste-
jovsky, 2008). TimeML is a specification lan-
guage for events and temporal expressions in text. 
TimeBank is an annotated corpus which was 
made as a proof of the TimeML specification. 
TTK is an automatic system to extract events and 
time expressions, creating temporal links be-
tween them2.  
TimeML is an ISO standard of a temporal 
markup language and has been being extended to 
other languages such as Italian, Spanish, Chinese,

 TTK contains GUTime (TIMEX3 tagging, Mani and Wil-
son, 2000), Evita (event extraction, Saur? et. al., 2005), 
Slinket (modal parsing, Saur? et. al., 2006b), S2T, Blinker, 
Classifier, Sputlink, Link Merger, etc.   
 
etc. (ISO/DIS 24617-1: 2008). TempEval-2, a 
task for the Semeval-2010 competition, has been 
proposed (Pustejovsky et. al. 2008). The task for 
the TempEval-2 is evaluating events, time ex-
pressions, and temporal relations. Data sets will 
be provided for English, Italian, Spanish, Chi-
nese, and Korean. 
The necessity of temporal and event expres-
sions markup for any robust performance such as 
QA (for Korean QA system, refer to Han et. al., 
2004), IE, or summarization is applied to Korean 
NLP applications as well. Recently, there have 
been TimeML-related studies for Korean: Jang et. 
al (2004) show an automatic annotation system 
of temporal expressions with Timex2 in Korean 
text. Lee (2008) argues about the semantics of 
Korean TimeML, specially the EVENT tag. Im 
and Saur? (2008) focus on the problems of Ti-
meML application to Korean caused by typo-
logical difference between English and Korean. 
Motivated by them, the Korean TARSQI Project3 
started with the purpose of making TimeML, 
TimeBank and TTK for Korean text4.  
Porting TimeML to other languages can be 
challenging because of typological difference 
between languages. In this paper, we present the 
problems for TimeML application to Korean. 
Our solution is to change TimeML markup phi-
losophy: a change from word-based in-line anno-
tation to morpheme-based stand-off annotation. 
Based on the changed annotation philosophy, we 
decide how to annotate temporal and event-
denoting expressions in Korean text. More spe-
cifically, it is challenging to decide whether we 
use LINK tags or attributes to annotate some

temporal or event-denoting expressions (see ex-
amples in 3.2).  In section 4, we describe the 
specification of Korean TimeML (KTimeML). 
Section 5 introduces Korean TTK (KTTK). Be-
fore discussing the issues of Korean TimeML, 
we briefly introduce TimeML.  
2 The Basics of TimeML 
TimeML features four major data structures: 
EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK. The 
EVENT tag encodes event-denoting expressions. 
The TIMEX3 tag annotates temporal expressions 
of different sorts: fully specified dates, times, 
and durations, or just partially specified dates, 
times, and durations. The SIGNAL tag annotates 
elements that indicate how temporal objects are 
related among them (e.g., subordinating connec-
tors such as when or after).  
The LINK tag splits into three main types: (a) 
TLINK, which encodes temporal relations among 
EVENTs and TIMEX3s; (b) ALINK, representing 
aspectual information as expressed between an 
aspectual predicate and its embedded event; and 
(c) SLINK, encoding subordination relations 
conveying evidentiality (e.g. Mary said [she 
bought some wine]), factivity (John regretted 
[Mary bought wine]), or intensionality (Kate 
thought [Mary bought beer]).  
Information relevant to each tag is character-
ized by means of attribute-value pairs (refer to 
Pustejovsky et. al. 2003 about specific attributes-
value pairs). (1) illustrates an annotated sentence 
with the TimeML specification:  
(1)John saide1 that Mary begane2 to worke3 
John 
<EVENT id=?e1? class=?REPORTING?    
tense=?PAST? aspect=?NONE? polar-
ity=?POS?> 
said </EVENT>  
that Mary  
<EVENT id=?e2? class=?ASPECTUAL? 
tense=?PAST? aspect=?NONE? polar-
ity=?POS?> 
began </EVENT>  
to 
<EVENT id=?e3? class=?OCCURRENCE? 
tense=?NONE? aspect=?NONE? polar-
ity=?POS?> 
work </EVENT> 
 
<TLINK eventID=?e1? relatedToEvent=?e2? 
relType=?AFTER?/> 
<SLINK eventID=?e1? subordinatedEvent=?e2? 
relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/> 
<ALINK eventID=?e2? relatedToEvent=?e3? 
relType=?INITIATES?/> 
 
Sentence (1) presents three EVENT expressions 
(said, began, and work). SLINK conveys an evi-
dential relation between e1 (said) and e2 (began). 
TLINK represents a temporal relation ? AFTER- 
between the two same events. ALINK encodes an 
aspectual relation ?initiates? between e2 (be-
gan) and e3 (work).  Due to space limitations, 
some EVENT attributes are obviated. 
3 Porting TimeML to Korean 
3.1 The Characteristics of Korean  
Korean is an agglutinative language whose 
words are formed by joining morphemes to-
gether, where an affix typically represents one 
unit of meaning and bound morphemes are ex-
pressed by affixes. For example, the sentence 
John-i emeni-kkeyse o-si-ess-ta-te-ra ?John-Nom 
mother-Nom come-Hon-Past-Quo-Ret-Dec 5 ? 
means that (I heard) (John said) that his mother 
came. Each morpheme has its own functional 
meaning or content.  
As shown above, consideration of morphemes 
is important for TimeML markup of Korean text. 
Here, we summarize TimeML-related character-
istics of Korean: 
(i) In Korean, functional markers (tense, aspect, 
mood, modality, etc.) are represented morphologically. 
English as an isolating language uses periphrastic 
conjugation to represent functional categories.  
(e.g. ?-keyss-?is a conjectural modal morpheme in pi-
ka o-keyss-ta ?it will rain?. While, ?will? is an auxil-
iary verb in it will rain.) 
(ii) Some subordination is realized morphologically 
via morpheme contraction.  
(e.g. ?-ta-n-ta? is a morphological contraction which 
denotes quotation in the sentence John-i nayil o-n-ta-
n-ta ?John-Nom tomorrow come-Pres-Dec.Quo-Pres-
Dec?. Its English counterpart is represented by subor-
dination: John said that he will come tomorrow) 
 (iii) Some connectives in English correspond to mor-
phemes in Korean.  
(e.g. Korean counterpart of the English connective 
?and? in I ate milk and went to sleep is the morpheme 
?-ko? in the sentence na-nun wuyu-rul masi-ko ca-re 
ka-ss-ta ?I-Top milk-Acc drink-and sleep-ending go-
Past-Dec?) 
(iv) The sentence type of English is represented by 
word order but that of Korean by ending morphemes  
(e.g. Declarative: pi-ka o-n-ta ?it is raining? interroga-
tive: pi-ka o-ni? ?Is it raining??) 
                                               
5
 Nom: nominative case, Hon: honorific morpheme, 
Past: past tense morpheme, Quo: quotative mood 
morpheme, Ret: retrospective mood morpheme, Dec: 
declarative sentence ending 
116
These properties of Korean make the porting of 
TimeML to Korean challenging. In the next sec-
tion, we discuss the basic issues of KTimeML.  
3.2 Basic Issues of Korean TimeML  
3.2.1 Morpheme-based standoff annotation  
TimeML employs word-based in-line annotation. 
It poses a challenge at the representation level, 
since it encodes information mainly based on the 
structure of the target language, and thus content 
equivalences among different languages are hard 
to establish. For example, indirect quotation in 
Korean offers an example of the mismatch of 
linguistic devices employed in different lan-
guages to express the same meaning. Quotation 
constructions in English use two predicates, the 
reporting and the reported, which TimeML 
marks up as independent EVENTs: 
(2) John saide1 he boughte2 a pen.  
  <SLINK eventID=?e1? subordinatedE-
vent=?e2?relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/> 
TimeML uses a subordination link (SLINK) in 
order to convey the evidentiality feature that the 
reporting predicate projects to the event ex-
pressed by its subordinated argument. 
On the other hand, a Korean quotative con-
struction, as in (3), has only one verb stem, 
which corresponds to the subordinated predicate 
in English. Note that there is no reporting predi-
cate such as say in English. Nevertheless, the 
sentence has a reporting interpretation.  
(3) John-i  ku-ka  wine-ul  sa-ss-ta-n-ta 
    J-Nom    he-Nom  wine-Acc  buy-Past-Quo-Pres-Dec 
    ?John said that he bought some wine? 
The quotative expression ?ta-n-ta above is a con-
tracted form of ?ta-ko malha-n-ta ?Dec-Quo say-
Pres-Dec?. Although (3) is a simple sentence in-
volving no subordination at the syntactic level, 
the two tense markers, ?-ss-? and ?-n-?, are evi-
dence of the existence of an implicit reporting 
event. Specifically, the past tense marker ?-ss-? 
applies to the main event here (sa-ss ?buy-past?), 
while the present tense marker ?-n-? is under-
stood as applying to the implicit reporting event 
(ta-n-ta ?report-pres-Dec)6. 
Constructions presented above show a prob-
lem for the standard TimeML treatment of a Ko-
rean quotative sentence. The relationship be-
tween reporting and reported events is expressed 
morphologically, and thus the SLINK mechanism 
                                               
6
 Tense markers of the construction can change: sa-ss-tay-
ss-ta ?buy-past-quo-past-dec: said_bought?; sa-n-ta-n-ta 
?buy-pres-quo-pres-dec: say_buy?, etc.  
for word-based annotation is not adaptable here. 
Because Korean transfers meanings through 
morphological constructions, morpheme-based 
annotation is more effective than word-based for 
TimeML application to Korean7.  
For morpheme-based tagging, we propose 
stand-off annotation for Korean because it needs 
two-level annotation: the MORPH tag 8  and Ti-
meML tags. Standoff annotation separates mor-
phologically-annotated data from primary data 
and saves it in a different file, and then TimeML 
annotation applies to the data. The following is 
the proposed morpheme-based stand-off annota-
tion for (3). 
(4) Morpheme-based stand-off annotation for (3) 
<MORPH id=?m7? pos=?PV?/> 
<MORPH id=?m8? pos=?EFP?/> 
<MORPH id=?m9? pos=?EFP?/> 
<MORPH id=?m10? pos=?EFP?/> 
<MORPH id=?m11? pos=?EF?/> 
<EVENT id=?e1? morph=?m7 m8? yaleRo-
manization=?sa-ss? pred=?buy? 
class=?OCCURRENCE? tense=?PAST? sen-
tenceMood=?DEC?/>       
<EVENT id=?e2? morph=?m9 m10 m11? 
yaleRomanization=?ta-n-ta? pred=?say? 
class=?REPORTING? tense=?PRESENT? sen-
tenceMood=?DEC?/> 
<SLINK eventID=?e2? subordinatedE-
vent=?e1? relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/> 
<TLINK eventID=?e1? relatedToEvent=?e2? 
relType=?BEFORE?/> 
In (4), we show the example annotation of the 
MORPH tag for (3) to help readers to understand 
our proposal. Standoff annotation makes it pos-
sible to extract information about two events 
without using a non-text consuming EVENT tag. 
Moreover, each of the two tense morphemes is 
properly assigned to its related event. Our pro-
posed TimeML annotation scheme is composed 
of two levels ? morphological analysis and Ti-
meML annotation.

 There can be several ways of annotating morphological 
constructions: morpheme-based, morpho-syntactic unit-
based (refer to MAF: Cl?ment and Clergerie, 2005), charac-
ter-based, and bunsetsu-based. At present, we adopt mor-
pheme-based annotation because it seems to be enough to 
introduce the required units for KTimeML markup and we 
want to avoid the possible redundancy of bunsetsu-based or 
morpho-syntactic unit-based annotation. Moreover, the 
criterion for separation of a morphological construction is 
related with tags such as EVENT, TIMEX3, or attributes like 
tense, aspect, mood, or modality in KTimeML, not with 
syntactic or phonological information. Standoff annotation 
makes it easy to mark up the interval of morphemes. Never-
theless, we consider the possible advantage of morpho-
syntactic analysis positively for future work.  
8
 The values of the POS attribute are based on a Korean 
Part_of_Speech Tag Set version 1.0 (Kim and Seo, 1994).  
 
117
 3.2.2 Surface-based annotation  
KTimeML adopts the surface-based annotation 
philosophy of TimeML (Saur? et. al. 2006a), 
which does not encode the actual interpretation 
of the constructions it marks up, but their gram-
matical features. For example, the leaving event 
in the sentence we are leaving tomorrow is not 
annotated as expressing a future tense, but as 
expressed by means of a present tense form. 
Several considerations motivate this surface-
based approach. As an annotation language, it 
must guarantee the marking up of corpora in an 
efficient and consistent way, ensuring high inter-
annotator agreement. As a representation 
scheme, it needs to be used for training and 
evaluating algorithms for both temporal informa-
tion extraction and temporal reasoning.  
A surface-based approach is the suitable op-
tion for meeting such requirements. Neverthe-
less, it poses a challenge at the representation 
level. How to represent evidentiality in Korean 
and English shows the challenge.  
(5) I sawe1 that John boughte2 some wine. 
   <SLINK lid=?sl1? eventID=?e1? subordinat-
edEvent=?e2? relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/> 
English, as an isolating language, expresses evi-
dentiality in a periphrastic manner. Hence, the 
TimeML treatment of these constructions con-
sists in marking the two involved predicates as 
EVENTs, and introducing an SLINK between 
them. Korean has both periphrastic and morpho-
logical ways for expressing evidentiality. Anno-
tating the periphrastic version with the standard 
TimeML treatment poses no problem because it 
has two predicates denoting events like its Eng-
lish counterpart. Morphological constructions 
however, are harder to handle, because the retro-
spective mood morpheme ?-te-? brings about the 
implicit reference to a seeing event.  
(6) Vietnam-un   tep-te-ra 
    Vietnam-Top  hot-Ret-Dec 
    ?(as I saw) Vietnam was hot? 
They are similar to quotative constructions in the 
sense that, although there is only one predicate 
expressed on the surface, the sentence refers to 
more than one event. Unlike quotative construc-
tions, there is no morphological evidence of the 
implicit event; e.g. tense or sentence mood 
markers independent of those applied to the only 
verbal predicate in the sentence. The issue to 
consider is therefore whether to treat the eviden-
tial constructions by introducing an EVENT tag 
for the retrospective mood marker as in (7) or to 
handle them by specifying the evidential value of 
the main predicate at the MOOD attribute of its 
EVENT tag, as illustrated in (8). 
(7) SLINK tagging for (6) 
<EVENT id=?e1? morph=?m3? yaleRomaniza-
tion=?tep? class=?STATE? pos=?ADJECTIVE? 
tense=?NONE?/> 
<EVENT id=?e2? morph=?m4 m5? yaleRomaniza-
tion=?te-ra? class=?PERCEPTION? pos=?NONE? 
tense=?NONE?/> 
<SLINK lid=?sl1? eventID=?e2? subordinatedE-
vent=?e1? relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/> 
(8) Mood-attribute tagging for (6) 
  <EVENT id=?e1? morph=?m3 m4 m5? yaleRo-
manization=?tep-te-ra? pred=?hot? 
class=?STATE? pos=?ADJECTIVE? 
tense=?NONE? mood=?RETROSPECTIVE?/> 
As in (7), adding an EVENT tag for the retrospec-
tive morpheme corresponds semantically to Eng-
lish-based TimeML. However, it is not surface-
based, because the perception event is an implicit 
event entailed by the retrospective morpheme. 
While, the annotation in (8) is a surface-based 
annotation of the evidential construction which 
uses the MOOD attribute for retrospective mood, 
thus respects the surface-based philosophy of 
TimeML. This is different from the English 
counterpart that presents two EVENTs related 
with a TLINK signaling their relative temporal 
order. KTimeML follows the surface-based an-
notation philosophy of TimeML ((8) here).  
 
3.2.3 Cancellation of the head-only rule 
TimeML employs the head-only markup policy 
in order to avoid problems derived from tagging 
discontinuous sequence (e.g. we are not fully 
prepared). If the event is expressed by a verbal 
phrase, the EVENT tag will be applied only to its 
head, which is marked in bold face in the exam-
ples (e.g. has been scrambling, to buy, did not 
disclose). However, Korean does not have the 
discontinuity problem. See Korean examples: 
(9) a.*na-nun cwunpitoy-e   wanpyekhakey  iss-ta 
        I-Top  prepared-e    fully      exist-Dec 
      ?we are fully prepared? 
    b. *John-un  ca-ko         anh-iss-ta 
        J-Top    sleep-ko      Neg-exist-Dec 
        ?John is not sleeping? 
In the above sentences, ?-e iss-? and ?-ko iss-? are 
respectively perfective and progressive aspect 
markers. No word can make discontinuous se-
quence by being embedded into the middle of the 
verb phrases. As we saw from the examples, Ko-
rean does not have discontinuity problem in ver-
bal phrases. Thus, KTimeML does not need to 
follow the head-only annotation rule. By cancel-
lation of the head-only rule, we annotate various 
118
verbal clusters (main verb + auxiliary verb con-
struction: e.g. mek-ko iss-ta ?eat-progressive-
dec?). It makes the KTimeML more readable by 
showing the progressive aspect-denoting expres-
sion -ko iss- in one unit of annotation.  
4  Specification of the Korean TimeML  
Based on the proposed annotation principles of 
KTimeML, we present the specification of the 
first version of KTimeML (KTimeML 1.1) with 
changed tags, attributes, and their values. We 
assume that the MORPH-tagged data are sepa-
rately saved in a different file. KTimeML con-
tains EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK tags. 
Some new attributes such as mood and sType 
are added to the attributes of the EVENT tag. The 
other tags have no changes from the TimeML 
tags9.  
KTimeML 1.1 adds the attributes of predi-
cate_content (pred), mood, verb_form (vForm), 
and sentence type (sType) to the attributes of 
EVENT in TimeML (For Korean grammar, refer 
to Sohn, 1999, Nam and Ko, 2005). The BNF of 
EVENT is shown below: 
attributes ::= id pred morph yaleRomanization  
               class pos tense [aspect][mood] 
              [sType][modality] vForm  
id ::= ID 
{id ::= EventID 
 EventID ::= e<integer>} 
morph ::= IDREF 
{morph ::= MorphID} 
yaleRomanization ::= CDATA 
pred ::= CDATA 
class ::= ?OCCURRENCE?|?ASPECTUAL?|?STATE?|  
          ?PERCEPTION?|?REPORTING?|?I_STATE?| 
          ?I_ACTION? 
pos ::= ?ADJECTIVE?|?NOUN?|?VERB?|?OTHER? 
tense ::= ?PAST?|?NONE?  
aspect ::= ?PROGRESSIVE?|?PERFECTIVE?| 
           ?DURATIVE? | ?NONE? 
mood ::= ?RETROSPECTIVE? | ?NONE? 
   {default, if absent, is ?NONE?} 
sType ::= ?DECLARATIVE?|?INTERROGATIVE?| 
          ?IMPERATIVE?|?PROPOSITIVE?| ?NONE?  
         {default, if absent, is 'DECLARATIVE'} 
modality ::= ?CONJECTUAL?|?NONE? 
          {default, if absent, is 'NONE'} 
vForm ::= ?S_FINAL?|?CONNECTIVE?|?NOMINALIZED?|  
          ?ADNOMINAL? 
          {default, if absent, is 'S_FINAL'} 
polarity ::= ?NEG?|?POS? 
          {default, if absent, is 'POS'} 
KTimeML puts the semantic content of EVENT-
tagged expressions for international communica-
tion. Because mood is not an important gram-
matical category for English, TimeML does not 
                                               
9
 Nevertheless, how to annotate various morphologi-
cal constructions in the specific texts is not trivial. 
The annotation guideline, which will be published on 
the web, will handle the issues in detail. 
markup a mood attribute, but KTimeML adds the 
mood attribute since there are morphemes that 
express mood like many other languages. Unlike 
English, different sentence ending morphemes 
represent sentence types in Korean. Hence, 
KTimeML adds sType to attributes of the 
EVENT tag. We put vForm to distinguish be-
tween different subordinated clauses10.  
Event classes in KTimeML are the same as 
TimeML. Korean tense system does not have 
distinction between present and future unlike 
English, and thus the tense attribute has PAST 
and NONE values. We add DURATIVE to aspect 
attribute values in KTimeML for the durative 
expression such as combination of stative verb + 
progressive aspect marker (e.g. al-ko iss-ta 
?know-durative-Dec?). 
For mood, KTimeML 1.1 puts the retrospective 
mood (?-te-?). The values of vForm attribute are 
S_FINAL, CONNECTIVE, and NOMINALIZED, 
and ADNOMINAL. The sentence types in Korean 
are DECLARATIVE, INTEROGGATIVE, IM-
PERATIVE, and PROPOSITIVE (e.g. cip-ey ka-ca 
?Let?s go home?). KTimeML puts CONJEC-
TURAL (e.g. nayil pi-ka o-keyss-ta ?(I guess) It 
will rain tomorrow?) as a modality value and de-
fault is NONE. The sentence in (10) is an inter-
esting example that includes all attributes of an 
EVENT tag for Korean TimeML except for as-
pect.   
(10)ecey  Seoul-un  pi-ka  o-ass-keyss-te-ra 
     yesterday Seoul-Top rain-Nom come-Past-Conj-Ret-Dec 
      ?(From that I saw), I guess that it rained in Seoul  
           yesterday?

Each of the morphemes above has its own func-
tional meaning, which is represented as a value 
of an attribute in the EVENT tag. 
The major types of TIMEX3 expressions are:

Although the BNF of TIMEX3 in Korean Ti-
meML is same as that of TimeML, we point out 
that Korean time expressions also have the issue 
of how to treat morphological representations of 
temporal meaning. For example, pwuthe ?from? 
and kkaci ?to? in 3ilpwuthe 5ilkkaci ?From 3rd to 
5th? both are the counterparts of prepositions in 
English (Jang et. al., 2004). We do not tag tem-
poral morphemes as SIGNALs, in principle. In-
stead, we mark up 3ilpwuthe ?from 3rd? with one 
TIMEX3 tag. However, temporal connectives 
such as ttay ?when? in ku-ka o-ass-ul ttay young-
hee-nun ttena-ss-ta ?When he came, Younghee 
left? are tagged as SIGNALs.  
SIGNAL is used to annotate sections of text - 
typically function words - that indicate how tem-
poral objects are to be related to each other. It 
includes temporal connectives (e.g. ttay ?when?, 
tongan ?during?), and temporal noun (e.g. hwu 
?after?, cen ?before?). See the BNF of SIGNAL 
below:

SignalID ::= s<integer>} 
morph ::= IDREF

We show an annotated example which describes 
the difference of Korean TimeML markup from 
the English-based TimeML. The sentence below 
is a compound sentence.

LINK types splits into TLINK, SLINK, and 
ALINK. The BNF of TLINK is as follows: 
attributes ::= [lid] (eventID|timeID)  
               [signalID] (relatedToEvent| 
               relatedToTime) relType [comment]

{eventID ::= EventID} 
timeID ::= IDREF 
{timeID ::= TimeID} 
signalID ::= IDREF 
{signalID ::= SignalID} 
relatedToEvent ::= IDREF 
{relatedToEvent ::= EventID} 
relatedToTime ::= IDREF 
{relatedToTime ::= TimeID} 
relType ::= ?BEFORE?|?AFTER?|INCLUDES?| 
            ?IS_INCLUDED?|?DURING?| 
            ?SIMULTANEOUS?|?IAFTER?|?IBEFORE?| 
            ?IDENTITY?|?BEGINS?|?ENDS?| 
            ?BEGUN_BY?|?ENDED_BY?|?DURING_INV? 
comment ::= CDATA 
TLINK is a temporal link among EVENTs and 
TIMEX3s. For example, three TLINKs are tagged 
between the events in (11). We show those to-
gether with other LINKs in (12). Now, we show 
the BNF of SLINK.  
attributes ::= [lid] eventID [signalID]  
               subordinatedEvent relType  
               [comment]  
lid ::= ID 
{lid ::= LinkID  
 LinkID ::= l<integer>} 
eventID ::= IDREF 
{eventID ::= EventID} 
subordinatedEvent ::= IDREF 
{subordinatedEvent ::= EventID} 
signalID ::= IDREF 
{signalID ::= SignalID} 
120
relType ::= ?INTENTIONAL?|?EVIDENTIAL?| 
            ?NEG_EVIDENTIAL?|?FACTIVE?| 
            ?COUNTER_FACTIVE?|?CONDITIONAL? 
comment ::= CDATA 
The subordination link is used for contexts in-
volving modality, evidentials, and factives.  
In Korean, various morphemes bring about 
subordination clauses. Nominal endings such as -
um/-ki make nominal clauses (e.g. na-nun John-i 
o-ass-um-ul al-ko iss-ta ?I-Top John-Nom come-Past-
Nominal ending-Acc know-Durative-Dec?; na-nun 
kongpwuha-ki-ka shilh-ta ?I-Top study-nominal ending-
Nom hate-Dec?). Adnominal endings such as -n/-
un/-nun make adnominal clauses (e.g. na-nun 
John-i kaci-e-o-n kwaca-rul mek-ess-ta ?I-Top 
John-Nom bring-adnominal ending cookies-Acc eat-Past-
Dec?). Conditional clauses are also triggered by 
morphemes (e.g. na-nun John-i o-myen ka-
keyss-ta ?I-Top John-Nom come-Conditional go-Conj-
Dec?). All the above morphemes are not sepa-
rately tagged as SIGNALs. The words with the 
morphemes ? o-ass-um-ul, kongpwuha-ki-ka, 
kaci-e-o-n, and o-myen ? are tagged as EVENTs.  
ALINK is an aspectual link which indicates an 
aspectual connection between two events.   
attributes ::= [lid] eventID [signalID]  
               relatedToEvent relType  
               [comment]  
lid ::= ID 
{lid ::= LinkID  
 LinkID ::= l<integer>} 
eventID ::= IDREF 
{eventID ::= EventID} 
relatedToEvent ::= IDREF 
{relatedToEvent ::= EventID} 
signalID ::= IDREF 
{signalID ::= SignalID} 
relType ::= ?INITIATES?|?CULMINATES?| 
            ?TERMINATES?|?CONTINUES?| 
            ?REINITIATES? 
comment ::= CDATA 
Now we show the ALINK and TLINKs of the sen-
tence in (11).  
(12) LINKs between the events in (11) 
<ALINK eventID=?e2? relatedToEvent=?e1? 
relType=?CULMINATES?/> 
<TLINK eventID=?e3? relatedToEvent=?e2? 
relType=?AFTER?/> 
<TLINK eventID=?e2? relatedToEvent=?e1? 
relType=?ENDS?/> 
<TLINK eventID=?e3? relatedToEvent=?e1? 
relType=?AFTER?/> 
That is, the visiting event and the finishing are 
related aspectually and its relation type is culmi-
nating. The finishing event is related temporally 
with the leaving event by the signal ???(?after?). 
Naturally, the relation type of the TLINK is AF-
TER. From ALINK, additional TLINKs are de-
rived between visiting, finishing, and leaving 
events.  
5  Korean TARSQI ToolKit 
Based on the specification of KTimeML, we 
started to develop KTTK11.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Korean TARSQI Architecture 
At first, the normalization of the raw document is 
done in the preprocessor module. Here the raw 
text is separated into sentences, wide characters 
are substituted by regular characters, punctuation 
symbols are normalized (specially quotation 
marks), sino-korean characters (hanja) are 
transcribed in hangul, and, the encoding is also 
normalized to unicode. 
The next module is called Pykts (Python 
Wrapper for KTS). Here, sentences are parsed in 
order to get their morphological components, 
which is achieved by means of a program called 
KTS. With the exception of this morphological 
parser, which was programmed in C, all the other 
components of our project are being written in 
Python in order to achieve good results in less 
time. The output of Pykts is a Document object 
composed by a hyerarchical data structure of 
document, sentences, words and morphemes, 
which is passed to the Event Tagger. 
The Event Tagger consists of three modules: a 
preprocessor where the chunking of Time 
Expressions is done; a module called Saken, 
which does the tagging of events; and, a module 
called Sigan for TIMEX3 tagging. Then, LINK 
                                               
11
 The architecture mainly relies on that of TTK. 
However, KTTK introduces a morphological analyzer 
for morpheme-based standoff annotation. KTTK uses 
the Aspectual Verb Lexicon for ALINK extraction.  
121
taggers add TLINK, ALINK, SLINK tags. A 
module S2T changes the annotated SLINKs and 
ALINKs into TLINKs. In the final step, the LINK 
Merger merges all TLINKs with temporal closure. 
6 Conclusion and Future Work 
Temporal and event information extraction is an 
important step for QA and other inference or 
temporal reasoning systems. Korean TARSQI 
Project aims at (1) making KTimeML; (2) build-
ing Korean TimeBank as a gold standard, and (3) 
developing KTTK as an automatic markup tool of 
temporal and event expressions in Korean text.  
In this paper, we presented problems in port-
ing TimeML to Korean and proposed changes of 
TimeML philosophy. Since consideration of 
morphological issues is a basic step for KTi-
meML, we introduce a morpheme-based two-
level stand-off annotation scheme. We adopt the 
surface-based annotation of TimeML, but do not 
follow the head-only annotation.  
The tags of KTimeML are EVENT, TIMEX3, 
TLINK, ALINK, and SLINKs. The morphological 
annotation is saved as separate data. The EVENT 
tag has the attributes such as vForm, sType, 
mood, and modality in addition to the attrib-
utes of TimeML. We showed the architecture of 
KTTK.  
This work will be a help for QA, IE, and other 
robust performance for Korean. In addition, 
KTimeML will be, hopefully, a model for port-
ing TimeML to other agglutinative languages 
such as Japanese.
