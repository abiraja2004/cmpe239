Abstract
In this paper we describe an empirical
study of human-human multi-tasking dia-
logues (MTD), where people perform mul-
tiple verbal tasks overlapped in time. We
examined how conversants switch from the
ongoing task to a real-time task. We found
that 1) conversants use discourse markers
and prosodic cues to signal task switch-
ing, similar to how they signal topic shifts
in single-tasking speech; 2) conversants
strive to switch tasks at a less disruptive
place; and 3) where they cannot, they ex-
ert additional effort (even higher pitch) to
signal the task switching. Our machine
learning experiment also shows that task
switching can be reliably recognized using
discourse context and normalized pitch.
These findings will provide guidelines for
building future speech interfaces to sup-
port multi-tasking dialogue.
1 Introduction
Existing speech interfaces have mostly been used
to perform a single task. However, we envision
that next-generation speech interfaces will be able
to work with the user on multiple tasks at the same
time, which is especially useful for real-time tasks.
For instance, a driver in a car might use a speech
interface to catch up on emails, while occasionally
checking upcoming traffic conditions, and receiv-
ing navigation instructions.
Several speech interfaces that allow multi-
tasking dialogues have been built (Lemon et al,
2002; Kun et al, 2004). However, these interfaces

freely switch between different tasks without much
signaling. Thus the user might be confused about
which task the interface is talking about. Multi-
tasking dialogues, even in the best circumstances,
will be difficult for users, as users need to remem-
ber the details of each task and be aware of task
switching.
In order to build a speech interface that supports
multi-tasking dialogue, there needs to be a set of
conventions for the user and the interface to follow
in switching between tasks. To design such a set,
we propose to start with conventions that are ac-
tually used in human-human conversations, which
are natural for users to follow and probably effi-
cient in problem-solving. Multi-tasking dialogues,
where multiple independent topics overlap with
each other in time, regularly arise in human-human
conversation: for example, a driver and a navigator
in a car might be talking about their summer plans,
while occasionally interjecting road directions or
conversation about what music to listen to.
In order to better understand the human con-
ventions on task switching, we have collected the
MTD corpus (Heeman et al, 2005), which consists
of a set of human-human dialogues where pairs of
conversants have multiple overlapping verbal tasks
to perform: an ongoing task that takes a long time
to finish, and a real-time task that can be done in
a couple of turns but has a time constraint. This
paper is focused on how conversants switch from
the ongoing task to a waiting real-time task.
Previous research suggested the correlation be-
tween task switching and certain discourse con-
text; for example, conversants try to avoid task
switching in the middle of an adjacency pair (Shy-
rokov et al, 2007). In a preliminary study (Hee-
man et al, 2005), we examined the timing when
conversants switched from the ongoing task to a
real-time task using some pilot data, and found that
1025
conversants did not always switch to a real-time
task as soon as it arose, but instead waited for dif-
ferent amounts of time depending on its time con-
straint. In this study, we hypothesize that conver-
sants strive to switch at an opportune place in the
ongoing task, and we examine the discourse con-
text where task switching occurs for evidence to
support this hypothesis.
We are also interested in the cues that conver-
sants use to signal task switching. Although there
is a substantial body of research on how people
signal topic shifts in single-tasking speech (mono-
logue and dialogue), such as using discourse mark-
ers and prosodic cues (see Section 2.2), little re-
search work has been done in investigating task
switching in multi-tasking dialogues. In this study,
we examine discourse markers and prosodic cues
for their correlations with task switching. We also
examine combining these cues to recognize task
switching with machine learning techniques.
In Section 2, we review related literature. In
Section 3, we describe the MTD corpus. In Sec-
tion 4, we examine the discourse contexts in which
task switching occurs. In Section 5, we examine
the use of discourse markers and prosody associ-
ated with task switching. In Section 6, we exam-
ine automatic recognizing task switching with ma-
chine learning techniques. We conclude the paper
in Section 7.
2 Related Research
In this section, we first describe two existing
speech interfaces that allow multi-tasking dia-
logues. These speech interfaces, however, freely
switch between tasks as soon as a new task arises,
and without much signaling. We then review lit-
erature on how people signal topic shifts in single-
tasking speech, which sheds light on our research
of signaling task switching in multi-tasking dia-
logues.
2.1 Speech Interfaces for MTD
Kun et al (2004) developed a system called
Project54, which allows a user to interact with
multiple devices in a police cruiser using speech.
The architecture of Project54 allows for handling
multiple tasks overlapped in time. For example,
when pulling over a vehicle, an officer can first is-
sue a spoken command to turn on the lights and
siren, then issue spoken commands to initiate a
data query, go back to interacting with the lights
and siren (perhaps to change the pattern after the
vehicle has been pulled over), and finally receive
the spoken results of the data query. While the
current implementation of Project54 assumes that
the officer initiates the task switching (e.g. the
one about lights and the one about data query), the
system can initiate task switching too. However,
Project54 does not provide infrastructure for sig-
naling to the officer a system-initiated switch. Any
such signaling would have to be hand-coded by de-
velopers.
Lemon et al (2002) also explored multi-tasking
in a dialogue system. They built a multi-tasking
dialogue system for a human operator to direct
a robotic helicopter on executing multiple tasks,
such as searching for a car and flying to a tower.
The system keeps an ordered set of active dialogue
tasks, and interprets the user utterance in terms of
the most active task for which the utterance makes
sense. Conversely, during the system?s turn of
speaking, it can produce an utterance for any of
the dialogue tasks. Thus the system does not take
into account the user?s cost of task switching. The
system switches to a new task as soon as it arises,
instead of at an opportune place to minimize the
user?s effort. Moreover, the system does not sig-
nal when it switches between tasks. As with the
approach of Kun et al (2004) to multiple devices,
it is unclear whether an actual user will be able to
understand such conversations. The user might be-
come confused about which task the system is on.
2.2 Signaling Topic Shifts in STP
Although speech interfaces have not used cues to
signal task switching, researchers have found vari-
ous cues that people naturally use in single-tasking
speech to signal topic shifts. These cues are a good
starting point from which to study how people sig-
nal task switching in multi-tasking dialogue.
Signaling topic shifts in single-tasking speech is
about signaling the boundary of related discourse
segments that contribute to the achievement of a
task. Two types of cues have been identified for
signaling topic shifts. The first type is discourse
markers (Moser and Moore, 1995; Schiffrin, 1987;
Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Passonneau and Litman,
1997; Bangerter and Clark, 2003). Discourse
markers can be used to signal the start of a new dis-
course segment and its relation to other discourse
segments. For example, ?now? might signal mov-
ing on to the next topic, while ?well? might signal
1026
a negative or unexpected response.
The second type of cue is prosody. In read
speech, Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) studied
broadcast news and found that pause length is the
most important factor that indicates a new dis-
course segment. Ayers (1992) found that pitch
range appears to correlate more closely with hi-
erarchical topic structure in read speech than in
spontaneous speech. In spontaneous monologue,
Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a
discourse segment exhibited slower speaking rate;
Swerts (1995), and Passonneau and Litman (1997)
found that pause length correlates with discourse
segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani
(1996) found that the beginning of a discourse
segment correlates with higher pitch. In human-
human dialogue, similar behavior was observed:
the pitch value tends to be higher for starting a new
discourse segment (Nakajima and Allen, 1993). In
human-computer dialogue, Swerts and Ostendorf
(1995) found that the first utterance of a discourse
segment correlates with slower speaking rate and
longer preceding pause. Clearly, prosody is used
to signal topic shifts in single-tasking speech.
3 The MTD Corpus
In order to fully understand multi-tasking human-
human dialogue, we collected the MTD corpus, in
which pairs of subjects perform overlapping verbal
tasks. Details of the corpus collection can be found
in (Heeman et al, 2005).
3.1 Design of Tasks
Conversants work on two types of tasks via conver-
sation: an on-going task that takes a long time to
finish and a real-time task that just takes a couple
turns to complete but has a time constraint.
In the ongoing task, a pair of players work to-
gether to form as many poker hands as possible,
where a poker hand consists of a full house, flush,
straight, or four of a kind. Each player has three
cards in hand, which the other cannot see (players
are separated so that they cannot see each other.)
Players take turns drawing an extra card and then
discarding one, until they find a poker hand, for
which they earn 50 points; they then start over to
form another poker hand. To discourage players
from simply rifling through the cards to look for a
specific card without talking, one point is deducted
for each picked-up card, and 10 points for a missed
poker hand or incorrect poker hand. To complete
Figure 1: The game display for players
this game, players converse to share card informa-
tion, explore and establish strategies based on the
combined cards in their hands (Toh et al, 2006).
The poker game is played on computers. The
game display, which each player sees, is shown in
Figure 1. The player with four cards can click on
a card to discard it. The card disappears from the
screen, and an extra card is automatically dealt to
the other player. The player with four cards clicks
the ?Done Poker Hand? button to start a new game
once they find a poker hand.
From time to time, the computer generates a
prompt for one player to find out whether the other
has a certain picture on the bottom of the display.
The picture game has a time constraint of 10, 25
or 40 seconds, which is (pseudo) randomly deter-
mined. The players get 5 points for the picture
game if the correct answer is given in time. The
overall goal of the players is to earn as many points
as possible from the two games.
To alert the player to the picture game, two
solid bars flash above and below the player?s cards.
Thus the player will know that there is a wait-
ing picture game without taking the attention away
from the poker game. The color of the flash-
ing bars depends on how much time is remaining:
green for 26-40 seconds, yellow for 11-25 seconds
1027
and red for 0-10 seconds. The player can see the
exact amount of time in the heading for the pic-
ture game. In Figure 1, the player needs to find out
whether the other has a blue circle, with 6 seconds
left.
3.2 Corpus Annotations
We transcribed and annotated ten MTD dialogues
totaling about 150 minutes of conversation. The
dialogues were by five pairs of players, all na-
tive American-English speakers. Each pair par-
ticipated in two sessions and each session lasted
about 15 minutes. During each session, 9 picture
games (3 for each time constraint) were prompted
for each player. Of the total 180 picture game
prompted, 8 were never started by players
1
. Thus
the corpus contains 172 picture games.
The ongoing task can naturally be divided into
individual poker games, in which the players suc-
cessfully complete a poker hand. Each poker game
can be further divided into a sequence of card seg-
ments, in which players discuss which card to dis-
card, or a poker hand is found. In total, there are
105 game segments and 690 card segments in the
corpus. As well, we grouped the utterances in-
volved in each picture game into segments. Fig-
ure 2 shows an excerpt from an MTD dialogue
with these annotations. Here b7 is a game segment
in which players got a poker hand of flush; and
b8, b10, b11, b12 and b14, inside of b7, are card
segments. Also embedded in b7 are b9 and b13,
each of which is an segment for a picture game.
As can be seen, players switched from the ongo-
ing poker-playing to a picture game. After the pic-
ture game was completed, the conversation on the
poker-playing resumed.
4 Where to Switch
In a preliminary study (Heeman et al, 2005), we
found that players did not always switch to a real-
time task as soon as it arose, but instead waited for
different amounts of time depending on the time
constraint of the real-time task. We thus hypoth-
esize that players strive to switch at an opportune
place in the ongoing task (poker-playing). There
are three types of places where a player could sus-
pend the poker playing and switch to a waiting
picture game: (G) immediately after completing
a poker game (at the end of a game), (C) immedi-
1
Although in the post-experiment survey all players re-
ported that they never ignored a picture game on purpose
Figure 2: An excerpt of an MTD dialogue
ately after discarding a card (at the end of a card),
and (E) embedded inside a card segment, where
players are deciding which card to discard. In this
section, we examine where task switching occurs.
4.1 Time Constraint and Place of Switching
We first examine the place of switching under dif-
ferent time constraints. As shown in Table 1, for
the time constraint of 10s, 75% of the task switch-
ing was embedded inside a card segment, 23% at
the end of a card, and 2% at the end of a game;
for the time constraints of 25s and 40s
2
, 46% em-
bedded inside a card segment, 33% at the end of a
card, and 21% at the end of a game. The difference
in the places of switching between the time con-
straint of 10s and 25s/40s is statistically significant
(?
2
(2) = 15.92, p < 0.001). The time constraint
of 10s requires players to start a picture game very
quickly in order to complete it in time. On the
other hand, when given 25s or 40s, players are in
a less hurry to switch. Compared with 10s, when
players had 25s or 40s, the percentage of switch-
ing embedded inside a card segment decreases by
29%, while at the end of a card increases by 10%,
and at the end of a game increases by 19%. These
results suggest that when given more time, players
try to switch at the end of a game or a card.
2
We combined the time constraints of 25s and 40s because
25s seemed to be sufficient for most players.

4.2 Waiting Time and Place of Switching
We next examine the place of task switching from
the perspective of waiting time. Waiting time
refers to the time interval between when a pic-
ture game is prompted to a player and when the
player actually starts the picture game. Our ques-
tion is: if players wait at least a certain amount
of time, where would they switch tasks? We arbi-
trary choose a time amount of 3 seconds. We as-
sume that when the waiting time is shorter than 3s,
the player starts the picture game as soon as he or
she notices it without significant waiting; in other
words, based on human reaction time, if players
are going to respond to it right away, they should
be able to do so within 3s. The results are shown
in Table 2. When the waiting time is shorter than
3s, 69% of the task switching is embedded inside
a card segment, 27% at the end of a card, and only
4% at the end of a game; when longer than 3s, 47%
is embedded inside a card segment, 32% at the end
of a card, and 21% at the end of a game. The dif-
ference in the places of switching is statistically
different (?
2
(2) = 11.88, p = 0.003). When the
waiting time is longer than 3s, the percentage of
switching inside a card decreases by 22%, while
switching at the end of a card increases by 5%, and
at the end of a game increases by 17%. These re-
sults suggest that players wait for the end of a game
or a card to switch to a picture game.
4.3 Discussion
We examined the discourse context of task switch-
ing, and found that 1) when given more time, play-
ers intend to switch to a picture game at the end of
a (poker) game or a card; and (2) if players wait,
they are waiting for the end of a (poker) game or a
card to switch to a picture game. These results sug-
gest that players strive to switch to a picture game
at the end of a (poker) game or a card.
In fact, we also observed that after a picture
game that is at the end of a game, players smoothly
start a new poker game as if nothing had hap-
pened; after a picture game that is at the end of a
card, players might sometimes remind each other
what cards they have in hands; while after a pic-
ture game that is in the middle of a card segment,
players might even repeat or clarify the previous
utterances that were said before the interruption.
It is thus reasonable to assume that switching em-
bedded inside a card segment is the most disrup-
tive, followed by at the end of a card, and at the
end of a game is the least. Our experiment results
hence suggest that players strive to switch to a real-
time task at a less disruptive place in the ongoing
task. This is consistent with Clark and Wilkes-
Gibbs (1986), that conversants try to minimize col-
laborative effort.
5 How to Switch
In Section 2.2, we discussed how people use cer-
tain cues, such as discourse markers and prosody,
to signal topic shifts in single-tasking speech. This
suggests that people might also signal task switch-
ing in multi-tasking dialogues. In this section, we
examine how players signal that they are switch-
ing from the ongoing task to a real-time task with
discourse markers and prosody.
5.1 Task Switching and Discourse Markers
Close examination of the MTD corpus found
that ?oh? was the most frequently used discourse
marker when switching to a picture game. An-
other discourse marker, ?wait? (including ?wait a
minute?), was often used together with ?oh? in the
way of ?oh wait?. Thus we examined the use of
?oh? and ?wait? in switching to a picture game.
Players used the discourse markers ?oh? or
?wait? 14.5% (25/172) of the time in switching to
a picture game. In poker playing, 5.7% (238/4192)
of utterances contain the words ?oh? or ?wait?, and
only 4.6% (32/690) of card segments are initiated
with the two discourse markers (i.e. the first ut-
terance of a card segment has ?oh? or ?wait? at
the very beginning). Players have a statistically
higher percentage of using ?oh? or ?wait? at task
switching than in poker playing (?
2
(1) = 22.89,
p < 0.001) or to initiate a card segment (?
2
(1) =
21.84, p < 0.001).
5.2 Task Switching and Prosody
To understand the prosodic cues in initiating
a topic, traditionally researchers compared the
1029
prosody of the first utterance in each segment with
other utterances (e.g. (Nakajima and Allen, 1993;
Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996)). This approach
encounters two problems here. First, the words in
an utterance might affect the prosody. For exam-
ple, the duration and energy of ?bat? are usually
larger than ?bit?. Thus a large amount of data are
required to balance out these differences. Second,
in the MTD corpus, players typically switch to a
picture game by using a yes-no question, such as
?do you have a blue circle?, while most forward
utterances (c.f. Core and Allen 1997) in the ongo-
ing task are statements or proposals. As questions
have very different prosody than statements or pro-
posals, a direct comparison is further biased.
Examination of the MTD corpus found that 86%
(148/172) of the picture games were initiated by
?do you have ...? with optional discourse markers
at the beginning. While in the poker game, players
used ?do you have ...? 108 times to ask whether
the other had certain cards, such as ?do you have a
queen?? This observation inspired us to compare
the prosody of the phrase ?do you have? in switch-
ing to a picture game and during poker-playing.
3
This avoids comparing prosody of different words
or of different types of utterances.
We measure pitch, energy (local root mean
squared measurement), and duration of each case
of ?do you have?. We aggregate on each player and
calculate the average values. The results are shown
in Table 3. The second and third columns show the
average pitch of the phrase ?do you have? for task-
switching (SWT) and poker-playing (PKR) respec-
tively. When switching to a picture game, play-
ers? average pitch is statistically higher than poker-
playing (t(9) = 4.15, p = 0.001). In fact, for each
of the ten players, the average pitch of ?do you
have? in switching to a picture game is higher than
in poker-playing. These results show a strong cor-
relation between task switching and higher pitch.
We next examine the correlation between energy
and task switching. The fourth and fifth columns in
Table 3 show the average energy of the phrase ?do
you have? for task switching and poker-playing re-
spectively. We do not find a statistically significant
difference (t(9) = 0.80, p = 0.44). We also exam-
ine the duration of ?do you have?. The sixth and
3
Note that most cases of ?do you have? in poker-playing
are not at the beginning of a card segment. It would have
also been interesting to compare the prosody of ?do you have?
of initiating a picture game and of initiating a card segment.
However, we do not have enough data for the latter.

seventh columns in Table 3 show the results. We
do not find a statistically significant difference ei-
ther (t(9) = 1.03, p = 0.33). These results do not
support that energy or duration (i.e. speaking rate)
is correlated to task switching.
5.3 Intensity of Signal
To better understand how pitch is used in signaling
task switching, we next examine whether it corre-
lates with place of switching, i.e., switching at the
end of a game, at the end of a card, or embedded
inside a card segment. Because there are relatively
less data for switching at the end of a game (see
Table 1 and 2), we combine switching at the end
of a game and at the end of a card (C & G) as a
category.
Table 4 shows the average pitch of ?do you
have? when switching to a picture game embedded
inside a card segment, at the end of a card or game
segment, and during poker-playing. The difference
between these three conditions is statistically sig-
nificant (F (2, 9) = 15.61, p < 0.001). Switching
embedded inside a card segment has a statistically
higher pitch than switching at the end of a card or
game segment (t(9) = 5.54, p < 0.001), which
in turn has a statistically higher pitch than during
poker-playing (t(9) = 2.91, p = 0.01).

5.4 Discussion
Consistent with previous research on topic shifts in
single-tasking speech, our experiments show that
switching to a real-time task correlates with the
use of certain discourse markers and prosodic vari-
ations. It is not surprising that ?oh? and ?wait? cor-
relate with task switching. Task switching involves
a sudden change of the conversation topic, and pre-
vious research found that conversants use ?oh? to
mark a change of state in orientation or awareness
(Heritage, 1984). ?Wait? is used to mark a discon-
tinuity in the ongoing topic, which is also required
by task switching. Thus people may use these dis-
course markers to signal switching to a real-time
task. In terms of prosodic variations, we find that
task switching correlates with higher pitch. This
suggests that pitch is used to signal switching to a
real-time task.
Our experiments have also shown that pitch cor-
relates to place of switching. As discussed in Sec-
tion 4.3, task switching embedded inside a card
segment is the most disruptive, switching at the
end of a card is less, and at the end of a game is the
least. Our results show that switching embedded
in a card segment has a higher pitch than switch-
ing at the end of a card or a game, which in turn has
a higher pitch than non-switching (poker-playing).
This suggests that the degree of disruptiveness cor-
responds to the value of pitch: the more disruptive
place to switch, the higher is the pitch.
From our results we speculate that pitch is used
to divert the hearer from the ongoing task, sig-
naling an unexpected event (c.f. (Sussman et al,
2003)). When task switching is more disruptive,
the speaker uses higher pitch; probably because the
hearer has a stronger expectation of the next utter-
ance to be in the context of poker-playing. The
use of higher pitch servers as a cue that the hearer
should suspend the ongoing context and interpret
the utterance in a new context. According to the
theory of least collaborative effort, the effort of
raising the pitch by the speaker is probably to re-
duce the effort of recognizing and processing the
task switching by the hearer (Clark and Wilkes-
Gibbs, 1986).
6 Machine Learning Experiment
In the previous sections, we showed the correlation
of various cues with task switching. In this sec-
tion, we conduct a machine learning experiment to
determine whether we can reliably recognize task
switching using these cues. For the reasons given
in Section 5.2, we limit our experiment to the 256
cases of ?do you have?, 148 for task switching
and 108 for poker playing. We train a decision
tree classifier (C4.5) to discriminate task switching
from poker playing. We use 5-fold cross validation
to evaluate the performance. We use decision tree
learning because its output is interpretable and we
have found its performance comparable to other
discriminative classifiers for this task.
The feature set includes 1) discourse context:
whether the utterance before ?do you have? is the
end of a poker game, the end of a card segment,
or in the middle of a card segment
4
; 2) cue word:
whether the ?do you have? follows the cue word
?oh? or ?wait?; and 3) normalized pitch: the pitch
of ?do you have? divided by the average pitch of
the speaker during the dialogue.
The decision tree learning obtains an accuracy
of 83% in identifying whether a ?do you have? ini-
tiates a task switching or belongs to poker playing;
and the recall, precision, and F measure for task
switching are 90%, 82%, and 86% respectively. As
a baseline, if we blindly assume that all cases of
?do you have? are for task switching, we have an
accuracy of 58%. Thus decision tree learning with
the three features has 43% relative error reduction
over the baseline.
To examine the structure of the decision tree, we
build a single tree from all 256 cases of ?do you
have?. We find that the decision tree first examines
the normalized pitch; if it is greater than 1.085, it is
a task-switch. Otherwise, if the discourse context
is at the end of a game, then it is for task switch-
ing; if the discourse context is embedded in a card
segment, it is for poker playing; if the discourse
context is at the end of a card: if normalized pitch
is higher than 0.975 then it is for task switching,
otherwise for poker playing. Interestingly, the fea-
ture of cue word is not used in the tree.
The performance and structure of the learned
tree suggest that discourse context and normalized
pitch are useful features for discriminating task
switching.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we have described an empirical study
of human-human multi-tasking dialogues, where
people perform multiple verbal tasks overlapped

Card and game segments can be determined fairly accu-
rately from the mouse clicks even without the speech.

in time. We first examined the place of task
switching, i.e. where players suspend the ongoing
task and switch to a real-time task. Our analysis
showed that people strive to switch at a less dis-
ruptive place. We then examined the cues to signal
task switching. We found that task switching cor-
relates with certain discourse markers and prosodic
variations. More interestingly, the more disruptive
the switching is, the higher is the pitch. We thus
speculate that pitch is used by the speaker to help
the listener be aware of task switching and under-
stand the utterance. Finally, our machine learn-
ing experiment showed that discourse context and
pitch are useful features to reliably identify task
switching.
