Abstract 
The paper describes an interface between gen- 
erator and synthesizer of the German language 
concept-to-speech system VieCtoS. It discusses 
phenomena in German intonation that depend 
on the interaction between grammatical depen- 
dencies (projection of information structure into 
syntax) and prosodic context (performance- 
related modifications to intonation patterns). 
Phonological processing in our system com- 
prises segmental as well as suprasegmental di-
mensions uch as syllabification, modification of 
word stress positions, and a symbolic encoding 
of intonation. Phonological phenomena often 
touch upon more than one of these dimensions, 
so that mutual accessibility of the data struc- 
tures on each dimension had to be ensured. 
We present a linear representation of the 
multidimensional phonological data based on a 
straightforward linearization convention, which 
suffices to bring this conceptually multilinear 
data set under the scope of the well-known pro- 
cessing techniques for two-level morphology. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The task of interfacing between a tactical gen- 
erator and a speech synthesizer is two-fold: A 
grammatical description enriched with semantic 
and pragmatic features has to be translated into 
a (qualitative) phonological description which 
then has to be mapped onto the set of (quanti- 
tative) parameter values needed as input to the 
synthesizer. 
The requirements imposed by a concept-to- 
speech system differ from those on both text 
generation and text-to-speech systems. In

text generation the generator produces a se- 
quence of abstract descriptions of word forms 
which are-either by direct access to a lexicon 
or via a morphological component-transformed 
into strings of graphemes and output. With 
concept-to-speech t e task is more complex. 
Not only is segmental information influenced 
by morphonology and post-lexical rules (cover- 
ing, e.g., reduction and assimilation phenom- 
ena) but-more important-suprasegmental in- 
formation must be provided as well. 
Compared to text-to-speech the task is at 
the same time easier and more difficult. In- 
formation from pragmatic, semantic and syn- 
tactic layers are readily available. This elimi- 
nates the need to analyze an input text for nec- 
essary cues to come up with proper pronunci- 
ation and prosody. On the other hand all this 
information must be properly accounted for to 
come up with an adequate description of the 
utterance that-when fed into the synthesizer- 
produces high-quality output. In particular, 
pragmatic-semantic features must be mapped 
onto (abstract) prosodic features. 
We employ an extended version of two-level 
morphology (Trost 91) for this interface) The 
formalism proved to be very well suited for the 
task. The various Mmost independent subsys- 
tems can be kept conceptually separate result- 
ing in good transparency while at the same time 
enabling the necessary amount of interaction 
between them.

planning component produces entence plans, 
which are fed into the tactical generator. 
The implementation basis for the tactical 
generator is the FUF (Elhadad 91) system. 
FUF is based on the theory of functional unifi- 
cation grammar and employs both phrase struc- 
ture rules and unification of feature descrip- 
tions. Input is a partially specified feature de- 
scription which constrains the utterance to be 
generated. Output is a fully specified feature 
description (in the sense of the particular gram- 
mar) subsumed by the input structure, which is 
then linearized to yield a sentence. 
The tactical generator has two layers. One 
is dealing with sentence level generation, pro- 
ducing a tree-like description of a sentence, the 
leaves of which are lemmata annotated with 
morphosyntactic and prosodic features. The 
second performs generation at the word level 
producing annotated phonological representa- 
tions of the inflected word forms which are fed 
into the extended 2two-level phonology compo- 
nent applying morphological and phonological 
rules to arrive at the representation used as in- 
put for speech synthesis. 
A distinguishing feature of the grammar used 
in the generator is the integration of sentence- 
level and word-level processing within the same 
formalism.

This architecture forms an ideal platform for 
the implementation of the phonological inter- 
face. Necessary adaptions are limited to the 
data used: An existing grammar was extended

formation like (potential) accent and syllable 
boundary positions. 
Input to the synthesizer is a SAMPA string 
enriched with qualitative ncodings of prosodic 
information (e.g., pitch accent, pauses, ...) pro- 
duced by the two-level rules. Phonological spec- 
ifications of intonation are processed by a pho- 
netic interpreter (Pirker et al 97) that trans- 
forms these qualitative labels into quantitative 
acoustic parameters. Although some interpreta- 
tive work is done within the synthesizer, no lin- 
guistically motivated transformations are sup- 
posed to take place there. These all are per- 
formed within the two-level component. 
3 The  Phono log ica l  In ter face  
3.1 Phenomena hand led  
The phonological description in extended two- 
level morphology - in our case rather two-level 
phonology -serves ms the central interface where 
the modules for grammar processing and for 
speech synthesis meet and communicate. 
A fairly complex model of phonology is re- 
quired in the system, also because the over- 
all objective of the project was to investigate 
whether and how conditions in the concept-to- 
speech task favour a more elaborate treatment 
of prosodic parameters in speech generation. 
The phonological description is implemented 
in the extended two-level framework described 
in section 2 and works over a lexicon of phone- 
mic (rather than graphemic) representations of 
word stems and inflectional affixes. Morpho- 
tactic processing is thus restricted to inflec- 
tion, whereas compounding and derivational af- 
fixation are encoded in the lexicon, which is 
typically small in domain-tailored concept-to- 
speech systems. 
Nevertheless, in segmental phonology, the 
component must compute morphonological 
rules in inflection as well ms post-lexical rules 
which interact with syllabification and cliticiza- 
tion. 
To determine German syllabification and 
cliticization correctly, it is necessary to operate 
on structures larger than single words. There- 
fore phonological processing applies to chunks 
whose size depends on the one rule in the sys- 
tem that requires the largest phonological con- 
text to operate correctly. Because of the into- 
nation rules discussed in section 4, phonological 
1042 
processing applies to the whole utterance. 
The three phonological aspects segmental 
representation, syllabification, and word stress 
are mutually dependent in German phonology 
in all logically possible directions (Niklfeld et al 
95). The phonology component treats them in 
a unified description, which also covers the rare 
cases of word-internal and phrase-level stress 
shift in German. 3 
While some segmental and supra-segmental 
rules in the phonological description depend on 
phonological context only, some others (like the 
rule for stress shifts as described above) depend 
on grammatical information on levels as high 
up as textual representation. For example, the 
German word for "weather" loses word stress 
in compounds when they appear in weather- 
reports (where the concept weather is "textually 
exophoric" (Benware 87)). Such phenomena are 
encoded in our extended two-level system by 
phonological rules which access the grammat- 
ical representation via feature-filters. 
There are few theoretical frameworks in 
computational linguistics for tackling such a 
breadth of phonological issues. Linguistically 
ambitious approaches are often designed with 
little regard to ease of use in large descrip- 
tions, whereas leaner formalisms do not scale 
well to complex data stretching across a number 
of phonological dimensions. The chosen frame- 
work of extended two-level phonology stands 
between these poles. 
3.2 Linearization of multi-tier 
phonological structures 
As the two-level framework assumes one lexi- 
cal and one surface string only, we use a linear 
representation of our multidimensional phono- 
logical data, as follows: 
Each linear phonological string in the com- 
ponent stands for a multi-tier structure which 
combines a given number of separate dimensions 
of phonological structure. The tier of phonolog- 
ical segments (members of the German SAMPA 
",~') "s used to provide the backbone of skeletal 
points on which all units of the representation 
are linked together. Each unit on any phono- 
logical tier has scope over/has ms its domain a 
continuous ection of skeleton points. For each

stress. 
tier, a convention is provided which designates 
that part of each domain that is used for the 
linking. For some supra-segmental tiers (sylla- 
bles, phonological words) the leftmost unit of 
the scope domain ms computed by the respec- 
tive rule is used for this purpose. For other 
tiers the domain edges are unspecified in the 
lexicon (stresses and accents, which have scope 
over stretches of syllables), and therefore other 
well-defined parts of the scope domain are used 
for the linking (such as the vocalic nucleus of 
a syllable). Where it appears natural to do 
so, units on certain phonological tiers are also 
linked to right domain edges (ms is the case with 
phrase and boundary tone markers, which have 
scope over any phonological material between a
nuclear tone and the right boundary of an into- 
nation phrase.) 
While these representations clearly encode 
some fragment of atltosegmental phonology in 
an implicit way, they do not allow for the at- 
tachment of more than one suprasegmental unit 
from the same tier to a single segmental unit. 
Such power was not needed in our application. 
The representation allowed for easy incremen- 
tal extensions to our descriptions, as additional 
tiers of representation were added ms the cover- 
age of higher-level prosodic issues such as sen- 
tence intonation was extended. 
3.3 Implementational notes 
Using the linearized representation, the well- 
known processing schemes for two-level mor- 
phology can be applied directly. Contempo- 
rary compilers for two-level morphology allow 
to specify sets of symbols that are ignored in 
individual rules. Extensive application of such 
syntactic sugar enables us to keel) the rule for- 
mulations over the collapsed representation eco- 
nomical and relatively transparent. We note 
in passing that although collapsing multilinear 
data-structures onto a single tier increases the 
likeliness of combinatorial explosion in process- 
ing when using the two-level automata s trans- 
ducers, it turns out that in our already quite 
complex description this does not become a real 
problem. 
In earlier publications, we described how 
we implement phonological generalizations that 
stretch across phonological dimensions (Niklfeld 
et al 95), and we proposed implementations of 
suprasegmental issues such ms stress shift and 
1043 
the projection of pitch accents depending on fo- 
cus information (Niklfeld & Alter 96). We have 
also discussed time structure (Alter et al 96). 
In section 4 we go beyond this to show that 
intonation in German ha~s properties that are 
best implemented by combining our two-level 
phonological description, which is well-suited to 
express constraints on linear contexts, with the 
power of a unification-based feature grammar. 
4 Dea l ing  w i th  I n tonat ion  
This section describes the novel approach of us- 
ing the extended two-level component for spec- 
ifying "appropriate" intonation and phrasing. 
4.1 Dif ferent perspect ives  
The diversity of factors that influences intona- 
tion is mirrored in the variety of research that 
deals with intonation: 
Phonologists and phoneticians are concerned 
with the inspection of the form of intona- 
tion contours, while on the other hand there 
is a strong tradition in the field of syn- 
tax (keyword: focus projection) and seman- 
tics/pragmatics (keyword: given vs. new infor- 
mation) that merely deal with the problem of 
accent location, neglecting its form. 
Another strand of research deals with the cou- 
pling of information structure and phonology, 
i.e., the tight association of meanings and tunes 
such as in (Prevost & Steedman 94) where the 
classification of the utterance's elements along 
the dimensions theme/rheme and focus/ground 
unambiguously triggers the selection of tones. 
In the field of text-to-speech synthesis, at last, 
intonation most often is handled by using algo- 
rithms and heuristics that intermingle informa- 
tion on syntax, punctuation, word-class infor- 
mation etc. in a rather unstructured way. 
4.2 Our  des ign  
In our system a strict separation of levels is em- 
ployed: only the two-level coml)onent deals with 
tonal specifications. Within the tactical gener- 
ator only candidate positions for both pitch ac- 
cents and phrasal boundaries are selected. 
This reflects the fact that though prosody 
heavily depends on grammaticM and pragmatic 
factors, its realization is also strongly influenced 
by phonological nd phonetic onstraints which 
are much more "naturally" handled by the two- 
level component. In the terminology of two- 
level morphology the grammar provides a un- 
derspecified lexical representation from which 
the concrete surface form is derived. In the 
lexicon every (accentable) word contains an ab- 
stract pitch tone (T) within its phonemic rep- 
resentation. The "lexical boundaries" (B), i.e., 
candidates for boundaries between intonational 
phra~ses (IP), are inserted by the generator in 
between words and these T and B are then 
mapped to GToBI labels (German Tones and 
Break Indices- (Grice et al 96)) or discarded 
i.e., mapped it to surface 0. 
The following example (in pseudo-code) de- 
fines a basic condition on the IP: it contains at 
least one, at most three pitch accents, and has 
an obligatory boundary tone. 
<IP> : := {<P i tchTone>{<Pi tchTone>}} 
<Pit chTone>< IP_Bound> 
<IP_Bound> ::= L-LY, I L-HY, I H-LY. I H-HY. 
<PitchTone>: := <Ris ingT> I <Fal l ingT> 
<RisingT> ::= H* \] L+H* \] L*+H 
<Fal l ingT> : := L* I H+L* I H+!H* 
In order to determine the realization of a T 
the grammatical information the generator pro- 
vided for the word in question is inspected via 
the filter mechanism: E.g. if a words was 
marked a~s unaccented (acc -) the tone will be 
discarded or the selection of boundary tones is 
triggered by the sentence type (L-L7, in the case 
of a~ssertions): 
T:O <= _ f i l te r : (head (phon (acc -))); 
B:L-LY. <=> _ f i lter: (head (s-type assert)) ;  
While the rules discussed so far have been 
pure filter applications the last rule encodes a
constraint on phonological context: 
B:L-HY. => <Fal l ingT> <UnaccSyl l>* _ \] 
<RisingT> <UnaccSyll> <UnaccSyll>+ ; 
: i ? , 
| j 
i i 
I i 
.H* L-H% . H* ' 'H-L% 
Figure 2: Contours to be avoided (vertical lines 
designate syllable boundaries) 
The rationale behind this rule is, that we want 
to avoid the contours hown in figure 2 when re- 
alizing IP boundaries. The L-HT, boundary basi- 
cally designates a fall-rise contour which shoukl 
1044 
be a felicitous if the last pitch accent before 
the boundary was a falling one. The second 
term states, that after a rising pitch accent he 
same boundary contour is to be produced only 
if the pitch peak is followed by two or more 
unaccented syllables thus ensuring that there 
is "enough time" to produce the fall-rise. At 
the same time the production of the concurring 
H-LT, is blocked, which would produce a long 
monotonous stretch on a high level, that might 
be perceived as unnatural. 
The rules thus also implement some of the 
variability in prosody that is due to the interac- 
tion of phrasing and pitch accents much in the 
spirit of tone-linking (Gussenhoven 84). 
5 Conc lus ion  
With our approach we unify some of the efforts 
outlined in 4.1 and come up with a system that 
is more clearly structured than the "algorith- 
mic" approach. 
By basing our work on GToBI - and thus on 
a variant of Pierrehumbert's model on intona- 
tion - we have access to the wealth of phono- 
logical research undertaken i the tone sequence 
paradigm. 
The handling of accentuation and phrmsing by 
the generator esembles the syntacto-semantic 
approaches. Only a few tags such as emphasis 
\[EMPH\] and (conceptual or textual) givenness 
\[GIVENJ which are rather easily identifiable by 
the conceptual component and have a straight- 
forward influence on the phonetic realization are 
used. In this respect our approach is less re- 
fined than, e.g., (Prevost &: Steedman 94) as no 
fully fledged semantic module is integrated that 
could deal with aspects of information structure 
in a really principled way 
On the other hand we employ a very flexible 
and transparent phonological model. But not 
all intonation contours that can be observed in 
human speakers are equally convenient for the 
use in synthetic speech, where the deviations 
in duration, amplitude, etc. may lead to results 
that are perceived as highly unnatural. We thus 
restrict the set of possible contours licensed by 
the GToBI to a simplified subset. 
The system is implemented and deals with 
the task of generating monologuous weather e.- 
ports.
