SEMANTIC FOR TEXT PROCESSING 
Jean-Guy Meunier 
Universit~ du Quebec ~ Montreal 
Summary: 
Computer text processing is defined formally 
as a ordered set of sentences on which various 
interpretative functions operate to produce a 
transformed text. Semantic is here understood 
a the set of these functions and their ordering. 
A common language is suggested both for the 
sentences and the functions. A case study is 
presented. 
i..Text interpretation 
If a computer was to read and understand a 
sentence such as "Women love bachelors" how 
would we describe the semantic process going 
on? A first type of answer would bring us 
directly in the world denoted by such a 
sentence: To this sentence corresponds a 
world situation of which one can give a for- 
mal representation for instance in set 
theoretical terms: there exist a certain 
state of affair, and a set of human beings, 
in which there is a subset of women and 
a subset of man in which the subset bachelor 
is itself contained and there exist a spe- 
cific relation between the individuals of 
the subset of women with the individuals of 
the subset of bachelors. Hence interpreting 
the first sentence is thus to know the state 
of the world in which such a complex relation 
exist or for which this sentence is true. 
In an other vocabulary, one could ask 
his data base to see if in the world 
representation or the frames, the scenarios, 
the templates, the nets, etc. there exist or 
can be inferred such a relation between 
these individuals? 
In a second line of interpretation, one 
could stress the fact that it is impossible 
to set the state of affair in a world, be- 
fore knowing what "love", "women", and "ba- 
chelor" means. Depending on what is contained 
in these expressions, one can not decide 
what state of affair is to be chosen. Do 
women love young postgraduates, students, 
seals without a mate, or simply young 
unmarried males? 
Other types of interpretation wil l  add 
that one cannot even decide which reading to 
give to the sentence if one cannot see what 
usage of the sentence is made. If the sentence 
is used in the descriptive-affirmative manner, 
then the preceding interpretation can be 
accepted, but if the sentence is use in a 
more rhetorical manner then the interpretation 
could be insulting for the feminist user  and 
amusing for a male chauvenist~ 
Hence interpreting a sentence is not a sim- 
ple thing to describe. Yet, theories for 
computer processing of natural language will 
often stresse only but one aspect of the this 
semantic process. For instance the recent 
trend of artificial intelligence, be it the 
frames paradigm (Winograd 1972, Schank Wilk 
1973 or the more fregean-Montague (Schubert 1975, 
Cercone 1975, Lehmann 1978) insist on the ne- 
cessity of a world representation for the in- 
terpretation of a sentence or a set of sen- 
tences. This is a computer variation of the 
tarskian semantic. In an other tradition 
that of the lexical semanticists (Katz, Fill- 
more Miller) or the semantic net theorists 
(Quillian, Simmons, Woods) it is maintained 
that a semantic grammar should mainly include 
a clear relation, not only between an expres- 
sion of a language and the objects to which 
they refer in a particular usage, but also 
between the sense of the expression and their 
references. 
Hence one can see different types of rela- 
tions can exist in this semantic world: that 
is, relations between the expressions, the 
senses, and the objects themselves. As for 
the use aspect or pragmatics of the problem 
goes, except for a few odd explorations here 
and there, one relagates the whole thi~.g 
for future investigation. 
From the point of view of text processing 
distinguishing the various aspects of the 
semantic problems is of the highest importance 
for many recent projects in this field have 
in one sense reverse the problem. What one 
encounters is in fact much more conversation 
in natural language with a formal data base 
than real text interpretation. That is, given a 
semi-formal world representation couched in a 
conceptual dependency or a frames representation 
one system will try to relate questions to per- 
tinent states of the world (Lehmann 1978, 1979) 
anoaher system will rewrite the text amplifying 
it with a set of new sentences said to be pre- 
supposed in the understanding of the original 
--359 
(Schank, 1972). Another wil l  try mainly to 
disambiguate the original text and produce a 
set of adequat inferences (Wilks, 1973). In 
all these systems, a basic postulat is accepted 
and stressed: understanding can not be realised 
if there does not exist a minimal frame of refe- 
rence on which the interpretation of the sen- 
tences of a text  can rely. But real text pro- 
cessing at its limits although in part, has 
to accept this postulat must also be seen as 
a process of reading a text that is in itself 
a world representation given in natural lan- 
guage. A text not only describes, but also 
creates a world, of object and events. In 
other words new and old frames, world repre- 
sentation, data base are in the text itself. 
But in saying that, one becomes confused in the 
various world representations that are at 
work. 
To add to the confusion the inference, the 
desambiguation, the paraphrasing process all 
rise up in the interpretation of the words 
and sentences meaning. Each one giving the 
explanation in a new vocabulary. 
It is the aim of the following research to 
explore a more formal approach to the semantic 
problem of computer text interpretation. The 
main hypothesis could be summerize in the 
following manner. Semantic interpretation of 
text cannot lean on one unique type of reading 
be it referential, lexical, syntaxical or 
pragmatical. Semantic interpretation for texts 
is the establishement of a complex set of rela- 
tions between the various aspects of what phi- 
losophy, linguistic, logic artificial intel- 
ligence has called reference sense, use, 
lexicon etc. It is also possible to offer 
for all these aspects a common formal des- 
criptive language. 
2. Semantic space 
In order to render our explanation more 
intelligible we shall proceed in two related 
steps one non formal and the second formal. 
For the first step, we shall use a metaphor. 
Imagine a constellation of planets. Some of 
these planets cannot be seen by the naked eye. 
Yet each planet (seen or unseen) depends for 
its mouvement on the existence or non exis- 
tence of the other (gravity wise). What actually 
constitutes the constellation space is not the 
planets themselves but the gravity relation 
and movement holding them together. Exploring 
this metaphor we could underline various in- 
teresting properties of this space . A first 
dimension already stressed is the fact that a 
space is essentially a set of relations between 
planets. Without these relations there is no 
space. Secondly the relation is multiple that 
is, the path of one planet is the effect of mul- 
tiple gravity relations among the planets. 
Thirdly, the effect of the gravity forces on one 
planet affects each planet itself. There is 
a resonance relation from one to the other. In- 
formation on all the system can be found by 
analysis of the gravitutional force of one pla- 
net. To put in other terms, what affects 
one planet's graw\[ty affects all others. Forthly 
there exist a certain relativity of the depen- 
dencies, that is: each constellation of planets 
has its own pattern of dependencies which is 
different form one constellation to another. 
Let us now translate our metaphor into our 
semantic problem. Imagine that a text is a 
constellation of sentences, some of which are 
written down on paper (the material text) others 
not written down. Each sentence has a set of 
material properties that is, they are sentences 
of a language with their syntax and their se- 
mantics. Some of these sentences describes the 
syntactic structure of original sentences of a 
written text others describe the sense of the 
sentences, others describe the state of affair, 
etc. Our semantic space will be filled with 
different sentences each of which will focus 
on one or other aspect of a specific sentence 
to be interpreted. That is each "world" in 
this semantics space is actually a sentence or 
a group of sentences of a language each of which 
having a different role in the overall semantic 
space. Hence we shall have a syntactic world, 
a lexical-sense world, a referential world, a 
natural world. Or to put in a less metaphoric 
language, each sentences of a language will 
have a specific relation to its sense its refe- 
rence, its syntax etc. each of which can be 
expressed in sentence of a formal language. 
It follows from the metaphor that our se- 
mantic space is not the sentences themselves 
but the relations between the sentence and 
only the sentences. Secondly the relation 
is multiple. Each sentence has many types 
of relations with many other sentences. A 
structural representation sentence can be 
related to a sense representation sentence 
and a referential representation sentence etc. 
Thirdly, each sentence can be modified in its 
own form by information comming from another 
sentence. For instance a sentence with varia- 
bles for ambiguous words could need many type 
of decision before fill ing up the variables. 
Forthly the set of relations is relative to 
a user or a set of users. Each sub-constella- 
tions of sentences can be dependent on a set 
of possible users. There is a pragmatic rela- 
tion between these semantic spaces and the users. 
From this informal presentation we can see 
that the semantic space for a text is more 
than the constituant of the space itself 
(i.e. the sentences). In other words 
360 
a semantic grammar should be understood as set 
of relations c n various information sentences 
of a language. Therefore we shall define infor- 
mally this stage of the research a semantic 
grammar as a set of decision rules (functions) 
mapping a structured list of symbolic expres- 
sions or sentences into another list of symbo- 
lic expressions or sentences of a language. 
For instance a grammar could operate on a 
sentence such as "John has a dog" and deliver 
as output "John has ANIMAL" or "John POSSESS 
dog". Here the grammar has strictly transformed 
one sentence into another according to a set 
of decision rules. A semantic grammar is thus, 
a rule decision ~rocess  whose domain shall be 
sets of informations (or sentence of a language) 
that has been defined in the scientific litera- 
ture as syntactic structure (vg being a Noun- 
Phrase), lexical compotents (vg: bachelor: 
an unmarried man etc.), world representation 
(vg: to walk: Mouvement : tO put one's 
feet in the front one's body in x y z manner), 
conceptual dependency (vg to "give" implies 
the transferring of an object money, a receiver 
eto), conceptual inference (vg: to sell immlies 
that somebody buys etc.) 
Because of the ambiguity of thewords  trans- 
formation and translation. The first operating 
normally only on structures and the second 
operating between languages of various alpha- 
bets and rules, we have decided to talk of the 
functions that maps one sentence into another 
as a transmapping function. 
What is here emerging, is the fact that the 
interpretation of a sentence of a language 
is the assignment to it a whole set of rules 
transmapping various sentences from it, that 
is a sentence of a language can be transmapped 
into one or many other sentences each of which 
focuses on different aspects of the original 
sentence and more important where each trans- 
mapping is dependant for its existence on the 
role and function of the others. In that view 
of things, semantics would be seen not as a 
representation of the meaning of a sentence 
but a space in which differents sentences (from 
various or the same language) are related among 
themselves. The semantics of a language wil l  
thus be related mnong the1:iselves. The semantics 
of a language wil l  thus be related interpreta- 
tions having the form of sentences of a langua- 
ge. Our semantic representation hence becomes 
a semantic space. 
3. Formal definition of text semantics: 
From a set theroretical point of view, a 
text is nothing more than a set of ordered in-- 
formation units (words) (sentences) that is 
a text could be defined as a doublet 
TEXT: ~ W,R 
where W is a set of sentences with an orderin? 
relation R. Any analysis can then be thought 
as a transmapping function TF whose domain is 
a text or part of a text (a sentence) T~ and a 
range T.. Hence a textual analysis function is 
definedJas 
TF .(T i) = T .  \] 
From a logical point of view, a text is hence 
considered as a language, that is a set of 
primitives with an ordering relation R. And any 
textual analysis can be thought of as a type 
of translation process here called transmapping 
(for one can stay in the same language) that goes 
from a language to another language or a sen- 
tence in L. to a sentence in L. (where i can be=J) 
1 \] 
Each transmapping is realized by a set of 
rules that are sensitive to various contextual 
~eatures. Each transm~p itself becomes the 
entry for new rules of transmapping also 
sensitive to various contextual conditions. 
From a formal point of view, each sentence 
original or transmapped can hence be understood 
as the domain of an interpretation function 
whose range is another set of transmap sentence 
and so recursively. Semantic is the ordered 
set of these interpretation functions. 
Hence if T is a set of transmapping 
functions (TF ..... TF ) then a Semantic Inter- 
pretation SI?define~ as 
SI: ~T.Rr~ 
where T is a set of functions and R an ordering 
relation on these functions. 
As each transmap is logically considered 
a sentence of a language, it is possible to 
build for each one a specific grammar and 
vocabulary. But such a way to go about 
become highly cumbersome and lacks elegance. 
And in a processing perspective, a set of 
different formal grammar and vocabulary is 
not very economical. On theoretical grounds 
it would not also faithful to the highly 
recursive but conherent process of language 
functionning. Hence we shall try to give 
to all transmapped sentence a common set of 
primitives and rules such that there existe 
between each transmap a certain communality. 
Formally, each transmap will belong to a 
different sub set a common language and will 
have a set of common rules and lexems. Dif- 
ferentiation wil l  com~ by the variation in 
this common stock. 
This common language should apply also to 
the formulation of the transmapping functions 
themselves. In a sense, these functions are 
procedurial, declarative sentences, having 
specific types of predicats and variables. 
- 361 
Hence they should be formalized in a langage 
such that sometimes they will be taken at 
their face value. (i.e. as declarative) someti- 
mes at their reported ("de dicto") value. 
Hence the transmapping function sentences can 
be taken as part of the text~meeting in this 
way the fundamental aspect of natural language 
recursion. In other words each transmapped 
sentence and transmapping function will be a 
sentence of a common language called TML (trans- 
mapping language). This language because of 
its high flexibility will includes an alphabet, 
a lexicon and rules of formation that allow 
the description of the various type of predi- 
cats, variables and constants that one encoun- 
ters either in natural language or in the va- 
rious semi-formal representations (semantic 
nets -- templates -- conceptual dependency theory 
etc). It will be in fact an intensionnal lan- 
guage (Montague 1974, Vanderveken 1980) so that 
first and second order predicat can be used as 
much as a formal relation between sense and 
reference. 
As time and place does not permit do expli- 
citate here this language we shall content 
ourselves with illustration of the semantic 
process and language. 
4. Case study 
Let us take the sentence given as example 
at the beginning of this paper. "Women love 
bachelors". This simple sentence can explode 
into a multitude of transmapped sentences 
S 1 to S n 
SO: Women love bachelors 
This is the rewriting of the original one. 
Sl: (S(FNN(N(Women)) (Love) 
(N(Bachelors))) 
The structured sentence S O 
categorial grammar. 
in terms of a 
$2. 0 (All x All y ((Women x & Bachelor y) 
(x Love y)) OR 
S2. I (All x Ey ((Women x & Bachelor y) 
(x Love y)) OR 
$2. 2 (Ex Ey ((Women x & Bachelor y) 
(x love y))) 
The quantified transmap of S 1 with the am- 
biguous structures. 
nb. The number are only illustrative and 
not part of the transmap. 
S 3 ((All women love all bachelors) OR 
(all women love some bachelors) OR 
(some women love some bachelor)) 
(some women love some bachelor)) 
The transmap of S 2 in natural language 
expression 
S 4 ((Women love an (unmarried man) OR 
an (seal without a mate) OR 
an (young knight)) 
Transmap of S_ & S. with non formalized 
desambiguatio~ of bachelor. 
S 5 (Women (x ESSE POSIT (@L) y) & (y ESSE POSIT 
(~L) x) 
some bachelors) 
Transmap of SN, S 1 with meaning represen- 
tation of LOVE 
S 6 ((Louise is a woman) & 
(Kate is a woman) & 
(Jane is a woman) & 
(John is a bachelor) & 
(John is a man) & 
(Peter is a man) & 
(Peter is an unmarried man) & 
(Andrew is a bachelor) & 
(Andrew is a man) & 
(Louise loves Andrew) & 
(Jane loves Peter) & 
(Kate loves John)) 
This sentence describes the set of proper- 
ties of all individuals of this small 
world. 
As one can see the simple sentence of the 
original text has explodes in a multitude of 
new sentences. One should notice that the 
S 1 transmap is a purely syntactical repre- 
sentation; S 2 to S t are various transmapping 
for the desa~bigua~ion of the various lexical 
and sentential structures that sentence can 
have; S.~ is not directly a transmap of the 
origina~ sentence but a description of the 
state of affair to which sentence S O to S 5 
must relate in order to chose the rlght 
interpretation. 
A better but longer description of the 
various interpretation would have included also 
the various inferences and presuppositions 
illocutionary forces and transmapping 
function that such a sentence carries. A 
conceptual dependency model or a semantic 
net representation would probably be more 
pedagogicly adequat but still would be 
logically considered another complex sentence 
as Schubert (1975) have shown. Also a more 
homogeneous language than the one here chosen 
would shorten up the huge proliferation of 
-362  .... 
repitition. This is one aim the TLM language 
presents (not illustrated here). 
As one can  see, the "semantics" of the ori- 
ginal sentence is not a simple and unique 
representation either of its formal lexical 
or referential structure. All three here 
are working in the interpretation on the ori- 
ginal sentence. Hence for us "semantics" 
will not be only the representation of the 
meaning of a sentence in one or the omther 
language of formal, lexieal or referential 
structure but the set of relations established 
in among them. To interpret a sentence is 
here understood as a decision process that 
establishes specific relations between sen- 
tences. It is these semantic relations 
that the research tries to explore in a sys- 
tematic way.
