LINGUISTICS AND AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PI~OCESSING 1 
0.1 Th is  paper  is concerned  with natura l  l anguage ,  computers ,  
and two groups  of people  in teres ted  in natura l  language:  \ ] ingu is ts ,  and 
persons  engaged in computer  p rocess ing  of natura l  l anguage  data .  
There  is  some in tersect ion  of the la t te r  se ts ,  but the in tersect ion  is  
quite smal l  re la t ive  to the s i ze  of the sets  themse lves  and is  thus  in -  
adequate  to p rov ide  l ingu is ts  with a p roper  perspect ive  on automated  
language process ing ,  or computer  sc ient i s ts  with a p roper  perspec -  
t ive on l ingu is t i cs .  
A l though both groups  of persons  have  a mutua l  in te res t  in natur -  
a l  l anguage ,  the i r  conceptua l i za t ions  of the nature  of language and the i r  
approaches  to p rocess ing  language data a re  very  d i f fe rent .  To present  
a somewhat  overs imp l i f i ed  v iew of these  d i f fe rences :  l ingu is ts  tend to 
be theory -or iented- - they  are  concerned  with in teres t ing  but  somet imes  
qu i teesoter l c  p rob lems,  counter -examples ,  and the in f in i te  se t  of 
sentences  of competence ;  on the other  hand,  persons  engaged in  auto -  
mated  language process ing  tend to be data -or iented ,  and are  concerned  
with s ta t i s t i ca l  s ign i f i cance  and with some f in i te  subset  of the sentences  
of per fo rmance .  The quest ion  there fore  a r i ses  as  to whether  these  
d i f fe rent  perspect ives  a re  to be in terpreted  as  incompat ib le  or comple -  
r:~entary, and if complementary ,  whether  some research  concept  might  
p rov ide  the means  for  a un i f ied approach  to ana lys i s  of natura l  l anguage .  
In th i s  paper ,  Sect ion  1 dea ls  wi th  the perspect ive  of l i ngu is ts  on 
automated  language process ing  and computer  sc ient i s ts  on l ingu is t i cs ;  
Sect ion  Z d i scusses  the i r  respect ive  concepts  of natura l  l anguage  and 
l I  arn indebted to Pau l  GarT in  for  h i s  va luab le  comments  on 
th is  paper .  
and the i r  approaches  to ana lys i s  of natura l  l anguage ,  and exp lo res  the 
quest ions  ra i sed  above;  Sect ion  3 presents  some conc lud ing  remarks .  
1. 1 I t  i s  appropr ia te  to beg in  th is  d i scuss ion  with a br ie f  inqu i ry  
into the sources  of the common focus  of l i ngu is ts  and computer  sc ient i s ts  
on natura l  l anguage .  The in teres t  of l i ngu is ts  in natura l  l anguage  is 
g iven  by  def in i t ion;  the in teres t  of non- l ingu is t i ca l l y  o r iented  computer  
spec ia l i s t s  in natura l  l anguage  der ives  not f rom a concern  with language 
per  se,  but  f rom the funct ion  of language as  the pr imary  veh ic le  for  
communicat ing  in fo rmat ion  in human soc ie ty .  Whether  or  not one 
accepts  the idea of the so -ca l led  " in fo rmat ion  exp los ion ,  " the process ing  
of natura l  l anguage  text  is  an impor tant  cha l lenge  for both l ingu is t i cs  
and computer  sc ience .  The  sheer  vo lume of natura l  l anguage  in fo rma-  
t ion is  tax ing manua l  sys tems to the point  where  most  o rgan izat ions  
wh ich  engage  in la rge  sca le  in fo rmat ion  process ing  are  tu rn ing  to auto-  
mat ion  of operat ions  on natura l  l anguage  text.  While most  l ingu is ts  
a re  specu la t ing  on the theory  of language,  computer  sc ient i s ts  with l i t t le  
or  no l ingu is t i c  background are  a t tempt ing  to const ruc t  sys tems for  
ana lyz ing  the content  of natura l  l anguage  mater ia l s .  Obv ious ly ,  l i n -  
gu is ts  shou ld  become invo lved  in th is  deve lopment ,  but  to date,  few 
l ingu is ts  have  been  mot ivated  to par t i c ipate .  It appears  that  there  a re  
two bas ic  reasons  for  the cur rent  lack  of invo lvement .  
1. 1. 1 In the f i r s t  place~ among l ingu is ts  there  is l i t t le  apprec ia t ion  of 
the fac t  that  in essence ,  a l l  p rocess ing  of natura l  l anguage  in fo rmat ion - -  
whether  sc ient i f i c ,  techn ica l ,  or  l i te rary - - i s  a l ingu is t i c  p rob lem.  
Bas ica l l y ,  the process ing  of natura l  l anguage  in fo rmat ion  for  index ing,  
abs t rac t ing ,  fac t  re t r ieva l ,  t rans la t ion ,  or  any  o ther  purpose  requ i res  
an ana lys i s  of the content  of the text  and the representat ion  of it  in 
some s tandard  fo rm.  Idea l ly ,  content  ana lys i s  cons is ts  in determin ing  
the concepts  present  in the mater ia l  and the in ter re la t ions  ex is t ing  
among those  concepts ;  the fo rmer  is  based  on some fo rm of semant ic  
ana lys i s ,  and the le t te r  imp l ies  syntact i c  ana lys i s~ a l though the two 
fo rms of ana lys i s  a re  in terdependent  to a cons iderab le  degree .  
The  concepts  and re la t ions  wh ich  have been ident i f ied  are  then 
t rans la ted  into a set  of canon ic  sentences  represent ing  ~he content  of 
the document .  F rom th is  representat ion  of the content  of the document ,  
a l l  document  sur rogates - - such  as  s t r ings  of index  te rms or  thesaurus  
groups ,  abst rac ts  o r  ext rac ts  o r  t rans la t ions - -a re  produced.  In  the 
case  of fact  re t r ieva l  or  quest ion -answer ing  sys tems,  the canon ic  
sentences  represent  the be l ie fs  of the sys tem and serve  as  the base  
for  generat ing  fac tua l  answers  to spec i f i c  quer ies .  Thus ,  a l though 
most  ex is t ing  automated  content  ana lys i s  p rocedures  are  at best  low 
leve l  approx imat ions  of th is  idea l ,  it i s  c lear  that  ana lyz ing  the content  
of  natura l  language text  must  be based  on semant ic  and syntact i c  p r inc l -  
p les  and  is  hence  an obv ious  ob jec t  of l ingu is t i c  endeavor .  I t  i s  un for -  
tuante that  the s ign i f i cance  of th is  fac t  is  not  apprec ia ted  by the major i ty  
of l ingu is ts .  
I. I. Z A further--and not unrelated--reason for non-participalion 
linguists in automated language processing is a basic lack of knowledge 
about computers~ in the sense of realizing when a computer  is a handy 
tool~ and when it isn't so handy. By  this I don't mean a lack of knowl-  
edge about hexadecimal  systems, bits and bytes, or serial and parallel 
processors, but very simply knowledge of what  a computer  is good for.

The  fac t  is  that  for  many  of the operat ions  character i s t i ca l l y  per*  
fo rmed in l ingu is t i c  research ,  the computer  is  an  inva luab le - - i f  not an 
ind ispensab le - - too l .  Th is  is  a very  s t rong  c la im for the ut i l i ty  of the 
computer  in l ingu is t i cs ;  there fore ,  the grounds  on which  it is  based  
are  wor th  examin ing  in some deta i l .  
The  operat ions  wh ich  the l ingu is t  per fo rms in car ry ing  out research  
on a language or  languages  are  essent ia l l y  the fol lowing: he co l lec ts  
data ,  o rgan izes  and ana lyzes  them,  fo rmula tes  hypotheses  and ver i f ies  
them.  There  is  of course ,  a g reat  dea l  of feedback  ana lys i s  and  
recyc l ing  th rough al l  these  operat ions ,  which are  h igh ly  in terdependent .  
I t  i s  there fore  impract i ca l  to examine  the app l i cab i l i ty  of computer  p ro -  
cess ing  ind iv idua l ly  to each  of the operat ions  l i s ted  above.  S ince the 
impor tant  concept  of "o rgan izat ion"  app l ies  equa l ly  to data and hypothe-  
ses ,  in the fo l lowing the l ingu is t i c  operat ions  for wh ich  computers  can 
be used  wi l l  be grouped into these  two categor ies .  Where  these  oper -  
a t ions  a re  d i f fe rent ly  in terpreted  or va lued by l ingu is ts  of d i f fe rent  
schoo ls ,  d ivergent  po ints  of v iew wil l  be noted.  
Data  co l lec t ion  and  organ izat ion ,  operat ions  on the data base .  
There  a re  two senses  in which data is  co l lec ted  in l ingu is t i c  ana lys i s .  
The  f i r s t  sense  re fers  to the in i t ia l  co l lec t ion  of data for  inc lus ion  in 
the corpus  or  data  base .  For  a l ingu is t  work ing  with a language un-  
known to h im,  th i s  genera l ly  means  e l i c l t ing  such  data f rom an in fo r -  
0 
mant - -a  nat ive  speaker  of the language in quest ion .  Th is  operat ion  
can not  p roceed  in a haphazard  manner ,  but  for  the t rad i t iona l  descr ip -  
t ive l ingu is t  at  leas t ,  is one subcornponent  of a heur i s t i c  s t ra tegy  for  
d i scover ing  the bas ic  e lements  and  re la t ions  of a g iven language.  Be-  
5 
cause it is a heuristic rather than an algorithmic procedure, explica- 
tion for a computer  is a formidable undertaking. Thus  far, there has 
been only one attempt at automating parad igm elicitation for unknown 
languages (Garvin 1969): since this project also involves analysis and 
hypothesis formulation, a more  detailed discussion will be presented 
below. 
A second sense  of data co l lec t ion  is  the se lec t ion  of par t i cu la r  
data i tems f rom a prev ious ly  co l lec ted  data base .  -When work ing  with 
a language in which he does  not have nat ive  or near  nat ive  competence ,  
operat ions  on the data base- - that  is to say,  o rgan iz ing ,  search ing ,  
re t r ievh lg ,  and re f i l ing  data - -assume a dominant  ro le .  Th is  is  because  
the l ingu is t  cannot  re ly  on h imse l f  as  a source  of data  which  he can 
organ ize  and ana lyze  in te rms  of h is  own competence  ( th is  p rocedure  
presents  another  type of p rob lem,  which  is  d i scussed  in Sect ion  Z). 
The anthropo log ica l  l i ngu is t  thus  must  devote a d i spropor t ionate  amount  
of t ime s imp ly  to operat ing  on the data base ,  and espec ia l l y  to o rgan-  
i z ing his data.  He typ ica l ly  records  h is  data i tems on smal l  s l ips  of 
paper ,  wh ich  he then sor ts  and c ross - f i l es  accord ing  to var ious  c r i te r ia .  
The prob lem is that he can only  c ross - f i l e  a data i tem as  many  ways  as 
he has  dupl icate s l ips ,  an o r ig ina l  and three  carbons  be ing  about  the 
l im i t  of leg ib i l i ty  in record ing  data with a pen or penc i l .  The  four  
cop ies  a l low h im,  for instanc4' ,  a lphasor ted  f i les  of Eng l i sh /Language 
L,  Language L /Eng l i sh  and two morpho log ica l  c lass i f i ca t ions .  If the 
language is  a tone language other than I raqw--an african language in 
which tone and morphological classes coincide--four files are insuffi- 
cent even for morphological analysis; for syntactic and semantic analysis, 
6 
such a limitation constitutes a serious obstacle. 
There are two major problems inherent in these traditional data- 
handling methods, which may provide at least a partial explanation for 
the well-known inadequacies in the descriptions of the so-called "exotic" 
languages (Uhlenbeck 1960 ). In the first place, the operations in- 
volved in the creation of these files, retrieval of relevant data from 
them, and replacement of the data in the files require a great deal of 
the llnguistts time, which might be more  profitably spent in analysis 
and in hypothesis formulation and verification. Secondly, because in 
a taxonomic approach, classifications contained in the files in effect 
form the basis of the grammar ,  and because syntactic and semantic 
analysis requires a highly sophisticated and extensive organization 
of the data, these aspects of linguistic research inevitably suffer when 
data handling is limited to traditional manual techniques. 
Now,  the clerical operations of sorting and listing data rapidly 
and variously are just those at which the computer excels. The com-  
puter can speed i ly  p resent  a var ie ty  of a r rangements  of la rge  vo lumes  
of data,  which may expose under ly ing pat terns  not ident i f iab le - -o r  
ident i f iab le  only with d i f f i cu l ty - -by  means  of t rad i t iona l  card  f i l ing 
techn iques .  The poss ib i l i t i es  for automat ing these types of operat ions  
have yet  to be ful ly explo i ted;  however ,  p rograms for generat ing  
morpheme concordances  have been deve loped by Gr imes  and by

Formulat ion ,  o rgan izat ion ,  and ver i f i ca t ion  of  hyp0theses :  ana ly t i c  
and synthet i c  operat ions .  A l though a computer  cannot  spontaneous ly  
generate  hypotheses ,  it can  ass i s t  the l ingu is t  in recogn iz ing  pat terns  
in the data.  Moreover ,  in o rgan iz ing  and ver i fy ing  hypotheses ,  the

In addi t ion to the s t r ingent  requ i rement  for  exp l i c i tness ,  use  of 
the computer  necess i ta tes  a log ica l  o rgan izat ion  of hypotheses  in o rder

loose ly  o rgan ized  descr ip t ive  grammars .  
T rans format iona l  g rammars ,  however ,  p resent  a par t i cu la r ly

of the grammar - - le t  a lone across  components - -w i thout  the aid of an 
automated  grammar  tes ter .  Severa l  computer  p rograms for  tes t ing  
grammar  ru les  have in fact  been des igned .  These  inc lude a phono log-  
ica l  ru le  tes ter  (Bobrow and F raser  1968), severa l  vers ions  of syn-  
? tac t i c  ru le  tes ters  based  on the MITRE grammar  (F r iedman 1968; 
Gross  1968; Gross  and Walker  1968), the T rans format iona l  Grammer  
Tester  (TGT)  deve loped  by Londe andSchoene  (1968) for the A i r  Force  
UCLA Eng l i sh  Syntax  P ro jec t ,  and a sys tem const ruc ted  by IBM to tes t  
the grammar  of Eng l i sh  II (Rosenbaum 1967). A l though these  programs 
all  operate  th rough a synthes i s  p rocedure ,  the on- l ine  sys tem descr ibed  
in Gross  and Walker  a l so  has  an ana ly t i c  capab i l i ty  th rough the MITRE 
Syntact i c  Ana lys i s  P rocedure .  
In addi t ion to these  la rge ly  synthet i c  tes t  dev ices ,  many  ana ly t i ca l  
a lgor i thms ex is t .  These  inc lude a lgor i thms for morpho log ica l  as  well 
as  syntact i c  ana lys i s .  The des ign  of cer ta in  types of morpho log ica l  
ana lys i s  a lgor i thms for par t i cu la r  languages  is in fact  fa i r i )  well 
unders tood .  Reasonab ly  success fu l  suf f ix  ana lys i s  a lgor i thms have 
been  des igned  for  Russ ian  (Ramo Wooldr idge  1960) and for  Eng l i sh  
Chap in  19 6 7; Ear l  1967}. 
Numerous  computer  p rograms with var ious  theoret i ca l  bases  
have been  des igned  for  ana lyz ing  syntax .  These  inc lude var ious  ver -  
s ions  of the Cocke  a lgor i thm- -a  bot tom-to - top  pars ing  logic  which 
uses  a table of b inary  IC grammar  ru les  to deve lop s imu l taneous ly  
al l  poss ib le  ana lyses  of an input s t r ing  (for a d i scuss ion  of the Cocke 
log ic ,  see  Hays  1966, pp. 75-7;  for  recent  app l i ca t ions  of the Cocke 
9 
a lgor i thm in automated  language process ing ,  see Montgomery  1969). 
A top - to -bot tom pred ic t ive  equiva lent  of the Cocke a lgor i thm is the 
Kuno-Oet t inger  Syntact ic  Ana lyzer  (Kuno 1965). Both these a lgor i thms,  
however ,  suf fer  f rom the d isadvantage of produc ing mul t ip le  ana lyses .  
More  ef fect ive procedures  for syntact ic  ana lys i s  incorporate  t rans -  
fo rmat iona l  ru les ;  these include the MITRE Syntact ic  Ana lys i s  P ro -  
cedure  and that descr ibed  by Mart in  Kay (1967). Another  approach  to 
syntact ic  ana lys i s  is the " fu lc rum"  method,  repor ted  in Garv in  (1968), 
in which the grammar  and the pars ing  logic are  both incorporated  into 
the ana lys is  a lgor i thm.  
Although the synthet ic  ru le test ing sys tems d iscussed  above are  
useful  only for test ing fo rmal  g rammars ,  the analyt ic  a lgor i thms 
might  a lso be used  to tes t  t rad i t ional  descr ip t ive  grammars .  In the 
case  of descr ip t ive  grammars ,  c r i te r ia  for  o rder ing  and exhaust iveness  
a re  somewhat  less  r igorous ly  spec i f ied  than in fo rmal  g rammar ;  a 
descr ip t ive  grammar  is never the less  in in t r i ca te  network  of complex ly  
in ter re la ted  s ta tements  in which some. incons is tency  is probab le  if not  
unavoidable.  It would appear  that the most  e f fect ive  means  of p re -  
eluding such a poss ib i l i ty  is through sys temat ic  omputer  tes t ing .  
At p resent ,  the most  versat i le  device for test ing a descr ip t ive  
grammar  is probab ly  some vers ion  of the Cocke a lgor i thm,  which 
could be used  as a morpho log ica l  ana lyzer  with a set  of morpho log ica l  
ru les ,  and as a syntact ic  ana lyzer  with a set  of syntact ic  ru les .  In 
morpho log ica l  ana lys i s ,  the input s t r ing  would cons is t  of codes repre -  
sent ing the morphs  occupying the success ive  pos i t ion c lasses  which 
fo rm the par t i cu la r  word.  In syntact ic  ana lys i s ,  the input s t r ing  would 
I0 
of course consist of codes constituting the grammatical labels of the 
words which form the particular sentence. 
Finally, it is appropriate to discuss a computer application which 
is noteworthy not only by virtue of the fact that it is in the descriptive 
tradition, but also because it constitutes a substantial departure from 
the above-mentioned algorithms in several important respects (Garvin 
1969). First, both the analytic and synthetic computer systems dis- 
cussed above are mechan isms for testing a grammar  of a particular 
language; hence, they accept test data and hypotheses in the form of 
grammatical rules as input and produce as output various diagnostics 
showing how the data were analyzed by the rules. On  the other hand, 
Garvin's program collects unanalyzed data in an ordered manner by 
means  of its elicitation subcomponent, applies theoretical assumptions 
to the data, and outputs a hypothesis about the morphological structure 
of the language represented by the data. Second, rather than testing a 
grammar  of a par t i cu la r  language,  the immediate  object ive of the pro -  
g ram is to tes t  a theory  of l ingu is t ic  ana lys i s  as represented  by a d i s -  
covery  procedure  and the u l t imate  ob ject ive  is to exp l icate  the un iver -  
sa l  and near  un iversa l  assumpt ions  ( l inguist ic  universals)" that are  
imp l i c i t  in the operat ions  of the l inguist ic  ana lysL  Th i rd ,  the program 
thus inc ludes  al l  the operat ions  which a descr ip t ive  l ingu is t  per fo rms,  
except  for hypothes is  ver i f i cat ion .  Four th ,  t~e computer  p rogram is 
const ructed  on heur i s t i c ,  ra ther  than a lgor i thmic ,  p r inc ip les .  
I. 2 The linguistJs failure to recognize the significance for 
linguistics of natural language information is paralleled by the failure 
11 
on the par t  of many persons  engaged in automated  language process ing  
to recogn ize  that the prob lem is essent ia l l y  a l ingu is t ic  one, More -  
over ,  the l ingu is t ' s  lack of knowledge about the computer  as a versat i le  
language process ing  tool is complemented  by the lack of l ingu is t ic  
knowledge of his computat iona l ly -o r iented  counterpar t .  
Examples  of non- l ingu is t i ca l l y  o r iented  computer  p rocess ing  of 
natura l  language data in the guise of content  ana lys i s  a re  too nurne rous 
to ment ion  in deta i l - - the  c lass ica l  example  is Luhn ls  "KWIC I~ concept  
(Luhn 1959) and its mult i tudinous misapp l i ca t ions  (for an exhaust ive 
l i s t ing of these through 1964, seeStevens  1965). Examples  of some-  
what more  soph is t i ca ted  approaches  include the var ious  a t tempts  to 
ident i fy  concepts  and the re la t ions  obtaining between concepts  without 
recourse  to a sys temat ic  syntact ic  ana lys is  of the given text.  Charac -  
te r i s t i ca l l y ;  the text is segmented  into "chunks"  or " f ragments"  by 
an ad hoc recogni t ion  procedure  based  on l i s t s  of p repos i t ions ,  con-  
junct ions ,  in t roductory  adverbs ,  and the l ike (e. g. , Kochen 1969, 
Bohner t  1966, Br iner  1968, Wilks 1968). 
1.3 F rom all the  forego ing,  the conc lus ion is inescapab le  that 
essent ia l l y ,  the major i ty  of l ingu is ts  do not  have a proper  perspect ive  
on automated  language process ing  and the major i ty  of non- l ingu is ts  
engaged in automated  language process ing  do not have a proper  per -  
spect ive  on l ingu is t i cs .  Never the less ,  these two groups of persons  
have a common in teres t  in natura l  language.  It is there fore  approp-  
pr ia te  to examif le the i r  perspect ives  on the nature  of language.  Gen-  
e ra l l y  speaking,  the i r  v iewpoints  tend to be d ichotomous;  these

L ingu is ts  a re  concerned  with the ideal  of competence ;  automated

I f  one takes  a negat ive  point  of v iew, these  d ichotomies  repre -  
sent  i r reconc i lab le  diffe rence  s in the bas ic  concept ion  of language ; 
more  pos i t i ve ly ,  they  may be regarded  as  complementary  perspect ives  
on the nature  of language.  The  in i t ia l  i ssue  is  thus  one of determin ing  
wh ich  v iew is  cor rec t .  Should  the pos i t i ve  v iew be adopted,  there  is  
a more  fundamenta l  quest ion  as  to the potent ia l  for  un i fy ing the two 
approaches  to p rov ide  a ba lanced  a t tack  on prob lems of natura l

In answer  to the f i r s t  quest ion ,  it i s  reasonab le  to cons ider  the  
two approaches  as  complementary ,  s ince  the spec i f i c  weaknesses  of 
the data -or lented  pos i t ion  a re  o f f se t  by cor respond ing  s t rengths  in the 
theoret i ca l  o r ienta t ion ,  and converse ly .  In the fo l lowing d i scuss ion ,  
13 / 
the respect ive  de f i c ienc ies  of the two approaches  wil l  be examined and 
potent ia l  unifying Concepts wil l  be exp lored .  
2.1 The data -or iented  view of natura l  language is genera l ly  
characterized by a bias toward the data, a reliance on statistics, an 
interest in subsets of natural language, and thus a concern with some 
particular inventory of sentences of per formance exclusive of any notion 
of the infinite inventory of sentences of competence. 
There  are two general directions in which this weakness  is exhib- 
ited, depending on the size of the natural language subset that is in- 
3 volved. With extremely large subsets, data orientation is mainly due 
to data inundation, and computer  processing substitutes for theory. 
Ina  sys tem of this type, it is possible to per fo rm a great deal of com-  
puter processing without knowing quite what  it all means .  Content 
analysis may  be attempted by statistical techniques, but if the definition 
of the statistical word  is not correlated with an actual word  stem--or  
more  relexrantly, with a concept  which may be represented  in natura l  
language text  by a number  of d i f fe rent  words  and phrases - - then  al l  
that has rea l ly  been per fo rmed is a f requency  count of unique character  
s t r ings .  The actual  p rocess  of content  ana lys i s  remains  to be per -  
fo rmed.  
Another  var ie ty  of data -or ientat ion  weakness  invo lves  ext remely  
smal l  subsets  of natura l  language.  In this case ,  the defect  cons is ts  
in  the test ing  of theor ies  on very  l im i ted  amounts  of data - -o f ten  0nly 
3In th is  context ,  a la rge  subset ,  is  def ined as the ent i re  in fo rmat ion

? on the very  sample  f rom which the theory  was or ig ina l ly  der ived.  
C la ims  for  the genera l i ty  of techniques  der ived  by such means  must  
thus be v iewed with a cer ta in  amount  of skept ic i sm.  Unfor tunate ly ,

Z. Z On the other  hand, there  are  the weaknesses  of the oppos i te  
perspect ive ,  which is character i zed  by a preoccupat ion  with theory ,  
counter -examples ,  and the inf inite set  of sentences  of a speakerWs 
competence .  The de f i c ienc ies  of this approach  become apparent  in 
cons ider ing  a few passages from Katz, excerpted from a polemic 
between Katz and the philosophers Quine and Wilson. 
Referring to a paper in which Quine criticizes Carnap's treatment 
of analyticity, Katz supports Qulne's criticism of Carnap, stating that 
the Katz-Fodor theory does not require "such ad hoc devices as 
meaning postulates and semantic rules" to characterize an analytic 
sentence but rather defines it as "a sentence whose semantically 
interpreted underlying phrase marker  (generated by the optimal 
g rammar  for the language) is such that every semantic marking in

f requent ly  been leve led  at  t rad i t iona l  l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ions  by l ingu is ts  
espous ing  the generat ive  approach .  Accord ing  to this c r i t i c i sm,  the 
descr ip t ive  l ingu is t  su f fe rs  f rom an exaggerated  ependence  on his 
"corpus" - - the  body of l ingu is t ic  mater ia l  const i tut ing his data base .  
I His descr ip t ion  of the language- - in  fo rmal  te rms,  his theory  of the 
language- - i s  thus a descr ip t ion  of the corpus ,  and its va l id i ty  is a 
funct ion of the adequacy  of the corpus  as a representat ive  sample  of 
the language.

the read ing  for  i t s  p red icate  a l so  occurs  in the  read ing  fo r  i t s  sub jec t "  
(Katz ,  1967). Katz  thus  de f ines  "S is  ana ly t i c  fo r  L "  in  te rms  of theo-  
re t i ca l  const ruc ts  fo r  wh ich  he c la ims  un iversa l i ty ;  he  fu r ther  s ta tes  
that  for  each  language,  " fo r  each  L 1 that  i s  a poss ib le  va lue  of  "L" ,  
i t  i s  poss ib le  to d i f fe rent ia te  the ana ly t i c  f rom the nonana ly t i c  sentences

ju :c  t;.,,.~ w i th  the  semant ic  descr ip t ions  of the  sentences  in  L 1 p rov ided  
by  the , . I rammar  of  L I "  (1968) .  
UnfortuJ~.ately,  the  impact  of  Kat~s  arguments  i s  substant ia l l y  
reduced  by  the fac t  that - -a l though there  ex is ts  a de f in i t ion  of  ana ly t i c i ty  
wh ich  has  been  postu la ted  by Katz  in  te rms  of the  theoret i ca l  const ruc ts  
"under ly ing  phrase  marker ,  " " semant ic  in terpreta t ion ,  " " read ing ,  " 
" sub jec t  of,  " e tc .  , - - there  ex is ts  no grammar  fo r  any  L l to p rov ide  
the semant ic  descr ip t ions  of  L 1 wh ich  must  be con jo ined  w i th  Katz ' s  
de f in i t ion  to p rov ide  for  the d i f fe rent ia t ion  of  ana ly t i c  f rom non-ana ly t i c  
sentences .  
Moreover ,  i f  Katz  were  to s ta te  that  he  had  ac tua l ly  p roduced  a gram-  
mar  of  some L 1 complete  w i th  semant ic  descr ip t ions  and  presumably  
capab le  of  generat ing  the  set  of  sentences  of  a speaker ' s  competence  in 
L 1, no one  cou ld  prove  that  th i s  was  or  was  not  an  empty  c la im.  Katz  
h imse l f  has  a f f i rmed the  necess i ty  of  behav io ra l  tes ts  as  a means  of va l -  
ida t ing  the  empi r i ca l  adequacy  of  h i s  theoret i ca l  fo rmula t ions  (Katz  
1967, 1968). However ,  p rev ious  a t tempts  to invest igate  var ious  syntac -  
t ic  phenomena through behav io ra l  exper iments  have  not  been  spectacu l -  
a r ly  success fu l ,  and  s ince  the  invest igat ion  of  semant ic  phenomena 
16 
is ines t imab ly  more  complex ,  behav iora l  ver i f i ca t ion  of a g rammar  
of L 1 appears  imposs ib le .  
Th is  d i f f i cu l ty  der ives  f rom tw~ sources ,  one of wh ich  invo lves  
the nature  of mean ing ,  and the ~ther ,  the present  s ta te  of knowledge 
about  l ingu is t i c  per fo rmance ,  o r  speech  behav ior .  
The semant ic  p rob lem l ies  in the fact  that  a great  deal  of mean-  
ing is s i tuat iona l ly  der ived ;  the phys ica l  and soc i~cu l tura l  s i tuat ion  to 
a cons iderab le  extent  cont ro l s  the semant ic  in terpretat ion  of sen-  
tences .  In the nar row sense ,  the c:~neept of a phys ica l  and soc iocu l -  
tu ra l  context  can  be l im i ted  to those  s i tuat ions  wh ich  are  par t i c ipated  
in by a major i ty  of the speakers  of the language:  say ,  a schoo l ,  a c i ty.  
an a i rpor t .  In the broader  sense ,  however ,  phys ica l  and s~c i :~cu l tura l  
context  inc ludes  such  fac tors  as  the ent i re  h i s to ry  of an in teract ion  
between two persons - - in  o ther  words ,  a l l  the occas ions  on wh ich  they  
have  in teracted  and the content  of those  ins tances  of in teract ion .  With-  
out  such  in fo rmat ion ,  a n ro~er  in terpretat ion  of innuendoes ,  jokes ,  
a l lus ions ,  and so fo r th ,  would  not  be poss ib le .  A lso ,  in the sense  of 
an in teract ion  between persons ,  the context  is dynamic ;  it g rows  f rom 
the incept ion  of the in teract ion  to i ts  conc lus ion .  
Thus ,  the speech  event  is ac tua l ly  per fo rmed in an env i ron-  
ment  cons is t ing  of the ent i re  range  of phys ica l  and s ~c iocu l tura l  
phenomena wh ich  are  re levant  to i ts in terpretat ion .  For  th is  reason ,  
semant ic  in terpretat ion  presents  prob lems of cons iderab le  magn i tude ,  
some of wh ich  may be inherent ly  inso lub le .  
17 
Sett ing the semant ic  p rob lem as ide  fo r  the moment , - .we  cons ider  
the second source  of d i f f i cu l ty  encountered  in a t tempt ing  to va l idate  
a grammar  of L 1 th rough behav iora l  tes t ing :  the present  lack  of an  
adequate  theory  of per fo rmance ,  or  speech  behav ior .  A grammar  is  
a m~del  of a speakerVs  innate  capac i ty ,  and not  of the ways  he uses  
th is  capac i ty  t ~ produce  and unders tand  sentences .  A l though exper i . -  
ments  suggest  the psycho log ica l  rea l i ty  of some features  of the s t ruc -  
tu ra l  descr ip t i ,ns  generated  by the competence  mode l  o r  g rammar  
(Fodor  and Gar re t t  1967), a speaker  demonst ra tes  h is  competence  
thr~ughh is  ~er formance ,  and the re la t ion  between a speaker l s  com-  
petence  and h is  per fo rmance  has  yet to be exp l i ca ted .  Assuming  that  
a speaker  of L 1 wi l l  p roduce  and unders tand  only  sentences  for  wh ich  
the grammar  of L 1 can supp ly  s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions ,  the prob lem is 
reduced to determin ing  how the speaker  behaves  in te rms of the s t ruc -  
tu ra l  descr ip t ion ,  which is not  t r iv ia l  to beg in  with.  
However ,  re in t roduc ing  the semant ic  p rob lem d iscussed  above,  it 
is c lear  that  the exp l i ca t ion  of per fo rmance  invo lves  spec i f i ca t ion  of 
"the speaker J s  behav ior  in compos ing  and in terpret ing  sentences  wi th  
respect  not only to s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions ,  but  a l so  to the to ta l  env i r -  
onment  of the speech  event .  Thus  speakers  can  and do process  sen-  
tences  wh ich  thegrammar  is not capab le  of generat ing ;  in o ther  words ,  
the re la t ion  between the sentences  of competence  and those  of per fo rm-  
ance  is n~t ~ne of s imp le  inc lus ion .  As noted by Kasher  (1967) and 
deve loped in deta i l  by Watt  (1968), there  are  cer ta in  features  of the 
sentences  of per fo rmance  wh ich  cannot  be rep l i ca ted  in a comvetence  
mode l - - these  inc lude those  wh ich  are  der ived  insome way f rom the 
18 
phys ica l  and soc iocu l tura l  s i tuat ion .  An example  of such  a feature  is  
de le tab i l i ty ;  the sentences  of per fo rmance  are  character i zed  by  de le -  
t ions  wh ich  are  not recoverab le  f rom the immediate  l ingu is t i c  context .  
but  must  be supp l ied  f rom the phys ica l  and soc i~cu l tura l  env i ronment .  
Unfor tunate ly ,  fo rmal  g rammars  tend t ~ be based  on i so la ted  examples  
~f the per fo rmance  of the l ingu is t i c  invest igator ,  ra ther  than on spon-  
taneous  sneech .  Th is  p ract i ce  has  the d i sadvantage  of e f fec t ive ly  e l im-  
inat ing  examples  of speech  wh ich  depend for  the i r  in terpretat ion  on the 
to ta l  env i ronment  of the speech  ex:ent. For  ins tance ,  the c rypt i c  
s ta tement  I ISumber  F ive  once"  is  not myster ious  at a race  t rack ,  where  
the numerous  de le t ions  are  recovered  f rom the env i ronment  (the SZ Win 
w indow of a thoroughbred  race  t rack)  to prov ide  someth ing  l ike the 
fo l lowing:  
(a) '~I wou ld  l ike to wager  two do l la rs  of the f ive do l la rs  
in my hand that  lhe horse  wh ich  is s ta r t ing  at Pos t  
Pos i t ion  F i r  s wi l l  win the next  race .  ,i 
Because  the sentences  of per fo rmance  are  la rge ly  context -depend-  
ent,  and because  there  is as  yet no exp l i ca t ion  of how speakers  behave  
in te rms of s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions - - le t  a lone  in terms of the tota l  en -  
v i ronment  of the speech  event ,  it is  apparent  that  the major i ty  of sen-  
tences  produced by speakers  of L 1 cou ld  not be generated  by the gram-  
r~ar  of L 1. Thus ,  a g rammar  of L l - -assuming  the ex is tence  of such- -  
cou ld  not  be va l idated  by behav iora l  tes ts ,  and there  wou ld  be essen-  
I 
t ia l l y  no way  of re la t ing  the sentences  ac tua l ly  per fo rmed by speakers  
of L 1 to th )se  spec i f ied  by the grammar .  It is  there fore  approur ia te  
to inqu i re  what  such  a grammar  might  be good fo r .  
19 
F rom the data -or iented  point of v iew it is c lear ly  inadequate ,  because  
it does  not dea l  with the sentences  ac tua l ly  p roduced  by speakers  of the 
language;  f rom the theory -or iented  point  of v iew it is a l so  unsat i s fac tory ,  
s ince  it is incomplete .  Yet, because  of the improbab i l i ty  of exp l i ca t ing  
the tota l  env i ronment  {as def ined above} of the speech  event ,  there  is 
l i t t le  hope that  a complete  semant ic  theory  wi l l  ever  be deve loped,  and 
ful l  unders tand ing  of how a speaker  uses  the competence  wh ich  the gram-  
mar  represents  is not l ike ly  to be acqu i red  in the fo reseeab le  fu ture .  It 
there fore  seems wor thwh i le  to cons ider  some concepts  and s t ra teg ies  
which might  serve  as  work ing  hypotheses  and prov ide  at leas t  an interir~. 
so lut ion  to p rob lems of the theor ies  of mean ing  and speech  behav io r .  
Z. 3 One concept  which might  p rove  use fu l  in th is  re  gard  is  that  of 
"semant ic  equ iva lence" .  Return ing  to the context -dependent  example  of 
race  t rack  par lance  presented  above,  it is c lear  that g iven  the phys ica l  
env i ronment  of the t rack ,  pas t  exper ience  in that  env i ronment ,  and  o ther  
re levant  soc iocu l tu ra l  phenomena,  the speaker  of Amer ican  Eng l i sh  
accepts  "Number  F ive  once"  as  in some way equ iva lent  o the exp l ic i t  
p ropos i t i ,n  p resented  in {a}. The two examples  be long to a se t  of sen-  
tences  which might  be descr ibed  as "semant ica l l y  equ iva lent  per fo r -  
mances"  for the purposes  of th is  p resentat ion .  These  sentences  a re  
thus  def ined on the assumpt ion  that  speakers  of Amer ican  Eng l i sh  
would judge them to funct ion  as semant ic  equ iva lents  in the appropr ia te  
env i ronment  {provlded that  the speakers  were  knowledgeab le  about  the 
par t i cu la r  env i ronment ,  e i ther  v i car ious ly  or th rough persona l  exper i -  
20 
ence .  Some add i t iona l  members  of the  sample  set  a re  as  fo l lows :  
" I  want  to bet  two do l la rs  on Number  F ive .  t' 
" I  want  Number  F ive  once .  " 
"G ive  me a two do l la r  bet  on the Number  F ive  horse . "  
"Put  two bucks  on F ive .  " 
"Two on Number  F ive .  v0 
Note  that  some of these  sentences  wou ld  be judged syntact i ca l l y  dev-  
iant  by  speakers  whose  exper ience  does  not inc lude  par t i c ipat ion  in  the 
mi l ieu  of a race  t rack .  Moreover ,  the  major i ty  of the sentences  wou ld  
be judged semant ica l ly  dev iant  in a non-bet t ing  env i ronment .  Those  
sentences  wh ich  wou ld  be judged semant ica l ly  appropr ia te  in o ther  en -  
v i ronments ,  however ,  der ive  the i r  appropr ia teness  not  f rom member -  
sh ip  in  the  set  p resented  above ,  but  f rom membersh ip  in  some other  
equ iva lence  set  wh ich  is  semant ica l ly  appropr ia te  for  the g iven  en-  
v i ronment .  For  example ,  "Two on Number  F ive"  might  a l so  be used  
in an  a i rpor t ;  but  in  th i s  case ,  i t  wou ld  be long  to an  equ iva lence  set  in -  
c lud ing  the fo l low ing  sentences ,  among others :  
" I  want  two seats  on F l ight  Number  F ive ,  wh ich  leaves  
Great  Fa l l s  a t  6:05 a .m.  and  ar r ives  in  Sa l t  Lake  C i ty  
a t  8:49 a.  m.  " 
"G ive  me two t i ckets  on the  f l ight  that  leaves  here  at  
6:05 a .m."  
" I  want  two seats  on Number  F ive  to Sa l t  Lake  C i ty .  ~u 
"Two t i ckets  on the next  f l ight  to Sa l t ' Lake  C i ty ,  p lease .  '~ 
In cons ider ing  the  not ion  of equ iva lence  set  as  a poss ib le  work ing  
hypothes is ,  a few operat ing  d i f f i cu l t ies  shou ld  be noted .  One such  
21 
di f f iculty l ies in expl icat ing the def in iens or  bas ic  member  of the set ,  
s ince it must  include al l  the re levant  features  of the phys ica l  and 
soc iocu l tu ra l  env i ronment .  A second prob lem cons is ts  in def in ing ap-  
p ropr ia te  equiva lence sets  for more  abst rac t  contexts ,  where  the 
notion of equiva lence is more  di f f icult  to spec i fy  than in the examples  
presented  above.  
However ,  this not ion - -wh ich  def ines  sets  of ins tances  of behav ior  
in te rms of the i r  funct ion as semant ic  equiva lents  in par t i cu la r  phy-  
s i ca l  and soc iocu l tu ra l  env i ronments - - i s  usefu l  for  two reasons .  In 
the f i r s t  p lace,  it p rov ides  a means  for  deal ing sys temat ica l ly  with 
the e lus ive  concepts  of speech  behav ior  and s i tuat iona l ly  der ived  
mean ing .  Secondly,  the notion of an equ iva lence set  p rov ides  an 
approx imate  def in i t ion of a re lat ions in the sense  of symbo l i c  logicj  
and is thus a means  of approach ing  a fo rmal i sm in an induct ive way. 
The d i f f icu l t ies  which inhere  in the expl icat ion of meaning  and of 
speech  behav ior  make it ra ther  unl ikely that such theor ies  wi l l  spr ing  
ful ly deve loped f rom the brow of some l ingu is t ic ian.  There fore ,  if 
complete  expl icat ion of meaning and speech  behav ior  is poss ib le  at 
all j  it would seem more  l ikely to be ach ieved by work ing f rom the ex-  
p l ic i t  to the inexpl ic i t  than converse ly .  
Accord ing ly ,  i t  is suggested  that  a reasonab le  approach  to prob lems 
of the theor ies  of meaning  and of speech  behav ior  would be the const ruc -  
t ion of an exper imenta l  mode l  for  ana lys i s  of natura l  language in te rms 
of se ts  of semant ica l ly  equivalent  per fo rmances  as def ined above.  The 
in i t ia l  mode l  would be deve loped f rom a data base  cons is t ing  of sentences  
22 
per fo rmed in a par t i cu la r  phys ica l  and soc iocu l tura l  env i ronment ,  and 
wou ld  thus  represent  a res t r i c ted  subset  of the natura l  language.  The 
env i ronment  se lec ted  for  the or ig ina l  mode l  might  be a race  t rack ,  an 
a i rpor t ,  a market ,  or  some other  type of s t ruc tured  s i tuat ion ,  in o rder  
to reduce  prob lems of def in ing  semant ica l ly  equ iva lent  se ts  of sentences .  
Success ive  vers ions  of the mode l  wou ld  be capab le  of p rocess ing  mater -  
ia l s  of inc reas ing  complex i ty  w i th  respect  to contextua l  var iab les - -e ,  g. 
the var ious  subsets  of "present -day  Amer ican  Eng l i sh"  represented  in 
Ku~era  and F ranc is  {1967). 
Assuming  a res t r i c ted  automat ic  thesaurus  and a data  base  in mach ine-  
readab le  fo rm,  a f i r s t  cut  at equ iva lence  sets  could  be prov ided  by separ -  
ate l i s t s{sor ted in terna l ly  by number  of thesaurus  group  ass ignments )  of 
sentences  conta in ing  words  or  phrases  f rom the same thesaurus  groups ,  
and words  and phrases  f rom the  same group  as  we l l  as  more  genera l  o r  
more  spec i f i c  g roups .  These  l i s t s  could  then be s tud ied  in deta i l  to 
i so la te  potent ia l  equ iva lence  sets .  The e lements  of the bas ic  member  o r  
de f in iens  of each set  would  be ident i f ied  in the course  of th is  s tudy,  and 
the set  membersh ip  va l idated  by behav iora l  tes ts ,  wh ich  wou ld  a l so  serve  
as  a means  of e l i c i t ing  add i t i~aa l  members  of the set  not represented  in 
the data  base .  
The f ina l  s tep  in const ruct ion  of the mode l  cons is ts  in represent -  
ing the de f in iens  in the notat ion  of fo rmal  log ic ,  and represent ing  the 
o ther  members  of the set  in te rms of the de f in iens .  Ana lys i s  of a sen-  
tence  presented  to the mode l  is thus  accompl i shed  through a dec is ion  
procedure  for  membersh ip  in a par t i cu la r  equ iva lence  set ,  by assoc ia t ion  
Z3 
with a par t i cu la r  de f in iens  or i ts  converse .  
3 .0  The proposed  mode l  is p resented  as  an approx imate  so lu t ion  
to p rob lems of theory  and data o r ienta t ion .  It overcomes  the respec -  
t ive weaknesses  of the two approaches  ( see  Sect ions  Z. 1 and 2. Z} by 
prov id ing  a means  of a r r iv ing  at theor ies  of mean ing  and speech  be-  
hav io r  th rough explo i tat ion of data bases  which  are  subsets  of a nat -  
u ra l  l anguage  conta in ing  ins tances  of speech  behav io r  used  in par t i cu la r  
phys ica l  and soc iocu l tu ra l  env i ronments .  Moreover ,  the concept  of 
equ iva lence  set  p rov ides  a data def ined approx imat ion  of the theoret i ca l  
not ion of a re la t ion ,  in the sense  of symbo l i c  logic .  Th is  is  of par -  
t i cu la r  in teres t  because  symbo l i c  logic has  been  used  as  a sys tem of 
semant ic  representat ion  both in computer  p rocess ing  of natura l  l an -  
guage data (Montgomery  1969, espec ia l l y  quest ion -answer ing  sys tems)  
and in l ingu is t i cs  (McCawley  1969)o Some convergence  of l i ngu is t i c
