Abstract 
This paper describes a system (RAREAS) which synthesizes 
marine weather forecasts directly from formatted weather data. Such 
synthesis appem~ feasible in certain natural sublanguages with stereo- 
typed text structure. RAREAS draws on several kinds of linguistic 
and non-linguistic knowledge and mirrors a forecaster's apparent ten- 
dency to ascribe less precise temporal adverbs to more remote 
meteorological events. The approach can easily be adapted to syn- 
thesize bilingual or multMingual texts. 
1. Natural Language Report Synthesis 
We use the term "natural language report synthesis" (NLRS) to 
describe the process of creating well-formed text which summarizes 
formatted ata in a given domain using a style which mirrors the con- 
ventions of professional report writers for that domain. 
NLRS for highly reslricted omains was first demonstrated in 
the work of Kukicb_ (1983) on "knowledge-based generation" of stock 
market reports. Kukich's ANA system produces professional- 
sounding stock market stmlmaries using a daily trace of Dow Jones' 
half-hourly quoudions for the market average and major indices. 
Both ANA and the analogous FRANA system for French (Contant 
1986) have used a phrasal lexicon approach (Beeker 1975) which lim- 
its the generality of the linguistic component, but which seems to 
suffice for small and stereotyped domains. The work described below 
represents a more modular approach to NLRS as well as a new appli- 
cation domain. 
2. Synthesis of Arctic Marine Weather Forecasts 
The RAREAS system was developed uring a five-month effort 
to explore the feasibility of synthesizing marine weather bulletins 
from formatted weather forecast data. The particular task was to pro- 
duce Arctic marine forecasts for five forecast areas to the east of 
Baffin Island (known as FPCN25 forecasts). Marine forecasts are 
one of several types of weather bulletin based on the same basic 
weather data, each type emphasizing the conditions of interest o a 
particular corurrmnity of users. In the case of marine bulletins, 
linguistic emphasis i  placed on wind direction and speed, dangerous 
wind and freezing spray conditions, etc. RAREAS is designed to be 
sufficiently modular and flexible so as to allow easy extension and 
adaptation to other types of weather bulletin (e.g., agricultural bul- 
letins, public weather forecasts). Although the current project seems 
to have proved the feasibility of automatically synthesizing weather 
forecasts, extensive testing and refinement is required before 
RAREAS or any successor can be introduced into daily use. 
The RAREAS system is the natural anguage component of the 
MARWORDS project, which envisages automating the process of 
creating bulletins from meteorological information. In the current 
manual procedure all the available meteorological information (obser- 
vations, radar and satellite imagery, and numerical weather prediction 
products) is made available to the weather forecaster. The weather 
forecaster must correctly diagnose the meteorological processes which 
will affect his particular area of interest throughout the forecast 
period, and then translate this knowledge into appropriate textual fore- 
casts for various users. 
In the proposed automated process, MARWORDS will use 
predicted values for meteorological parameters such as wind speed 
and direction, cloud cover, and others. In some cases, these predic- 
tions could be obtained directly from numerical weather prediction 
products. In most cases though, they would still be the result of a 
manual (i.e., human) forecasting procedure. MARWORDS will 
significantly reduce the workload on the forecaster, making it possible 
to focus more attention on meteorological problems. 
In the normal course of events, the predicted values make up a 
continuum in both time and space. For simplicity, values are often 
given at regular steps in time (e.g., hourly) and space (either at grid 
points, or at weather observing sites). Alternatively, forecast parame- 
ters may be given in terms of significant changes only. MAR- 
WORDS is flexible enough to accept both types of data description. 
In fact, the structure and nature of the required data is a problem 
which needs more work to resolw~. 
3. Design of the RAREAS system 
A major task in designing RAREAS was the definition of an 
input data format which properly divides the work between the MAR- 
WORDS expert system, which computes predicted values of weather 
parameters based on large-scale observations, and RAREAS itself, 
which interprets that data under local conditions for the purpose of 
marine forecasts. The format and its permissible content should be 
sufficiently rich in expressive power to reflect the nuances found in 
natural anguage forecasts. Ideally, the expert system should be kept 
as independent of forecast purpose as possible. RAREAS should 
therefore take care of all matters related to subjective valuation of 
the data (e.g., importance of individual parameters of marine fore- 
casts), as well as the linguistic expression of data values and data 
relations. 
In its current implementation RAREAS reads the formatted 
forecast data and carries out (sequentially) the following major opera- 
tions: 
- reading and parsing of formatted input data, with the interpre- 
tation of certain coded values; 
- checking of data for consistency and plausibility, using data- 
bases of geographical nd meteorological information; 
- insertion of default values when needed; 
- detection of conditions which are hazardous for marine opera- 
lions (e.g., freezing spray, calculated as a function of forecast 
wind speed and air temperature, and of a seasonally and region- 
ally adjusted water temperature taken from the database); 
- "merging of areas", namely, a check for similarity in the data 
for contiguous forecast areas; when similarity threshold condi- 
tions are satisfied a single report formula is created for the 
merged areas under a header which lists those areas; 
563 
- suppression of data not sufficiently salient for explicit inclu- 
sion in the report (e.g., temperature is generally dropped after its 
use to check if freezing spray conditions are present); 
- synthesis of pre-linguistie ("logical") representation for each 
sequence of weather events; 
- interpretation of transitions between weather events into same 
pre-linguistic form; 
- segmentation f logical structures into more.independent pre- 
linguistic lauses and sentences; 
- mapping of clausal form into English word strings, using 
proper terminology and style. 
These diverse functions are carried out by relatively indepen- 
dent modules written in MProlog. 
4. A Sample Report 
The following simplified example (figure 1) shows the input 
formatted ata, using mnemonic descriptors, for the Frobisher Bay 
forecast area. (Here, we leave aside the problem of possibly merging 
reports from the seven areas or sub-areas that are considered 
together).

Figure 1. Sample RAREAS formatted input. 
The formatted ata identifies the Greenwich time of report vali- 
dity, the date and area concerned, and then specifies initial values for 
each important weather parameter. Subsequent changes in the value of 
a parameter are preceded by the number of hours until the forecast 
change. Localized exceptions to the general forecast are preceded by 
a coded sub-area specification. At present, input data is limited to the 
six most important parameters: (1) wind direction, (2) wind speed, (3) 
cloud cover classification, (4) precipitation types (if any), (5) precipi- 
tation frequency and intensity rating, and (6) air temperature. Further 
forecast parameters which are functions of the input parameters (e.g., 
warnings and visibility ratings) are calculated by the first non- 
linguistic module. 
After reading and analysis, the data is manipulated in clausal 
form through data checking, area unification and data suppression 
stages mentioned above. It is then translated into a "logical form" 
just before input to the linguistic modules. 
Linguistic modules first calculate the values of signficant 
semantic features of incipient lexical items, particularly regarding 
direction and degree of changes. For example, winds which change 
direction in a clockwise direction will be described lexically as "veer- 
ing" to the new direction, whereas winds which change in a counter- 
clockwise direction are described as "backing". Initial lexical instan- 
tiation uses the most precise term available in the lexicon. Subse- 
quent segmentation i to sentences may juxtapose clauses in such a 
way that lexical variation is desirable. Precise terms may then be 
replaced by synonymic variants, or by more general (hyperonymic) 
lexemes.

5.Knowledge Sources for Report Synthesis 
The RAREAS architecture isolates different ypes of linguistic 
and non-linguistic knowledge within appropriate modules. Our gram- 
matical, lexical, rhetorical and stylistic description is based on an 
examination of all the marine bulletins (manually) produced for the 
FPCN25 region during the 1983 and 1985 seasons (some 50,000 
words in all). 
Examination of this extensive corpus of English has led to a 
fairly detailed grammar of this sublanguage (cf. Harris 1968, Kit- 
tredge and Lehrberger 1982). 
Linguistic knowledge is broken down into several types: 
- lexical semantics, including conditions for appropriate usage of 
words in terms of corresponding data values, and frequency 
preferences among synonymous terms in the subianguage of 
marine bulletins; 
- syntactic patterns, including the possible and preferred sen- 
tence patterns for expressing messages of given types; a second 
type of syntactic knowledge concerns the rules for deleting 
repeated sentence constituents when two or more propositions 
are fused into a single report sentence; 
- simple principles of text organization, specific to the variety of 
text to be synthesized, and hence a function of the data salience 
hierarchy (see below); 
Non-linguistic knowledge is of three types: 
- geographical knowledge for each forecast area including (1) its 
time zone, (2) its limits of latitude and longitude, and (3) the 
names of adjoining areas (to allow recursively merging adjacent 
areas in ease of similar meteorological regimes); 
- meteorological data including (1) mean temperature values for 
air and water during each month of the Arctic shipping season 
(June through October) and (2) record values for temperature & 
wind speed; 
- an "archive" of data from preceding reports, used to verify if 
dangerous wind warnings or freezing spray warnings are in 
effect. 
564 
Geographic knowledge is used primarily during tire attempt to 
merge reports for adjoining areas. However time zone data is used to 
calculate local time associated with meteorological phenomena, nd 
hence allow attribution of appropriate temporal descriptors (e.g., "by 
late afternoon"). Input data to the system has only the Greenwich 
reference time used by meteorologists. 
6. Linguistic Treamtent of Salience 
The structure of marine weather forecasts shows several 
linguistic correlates of data salience relations. First, warnings of 
dangerous conditions (strong winds and freezing spray in the FPCN25 
region) constitute separate headers preceding the normal text. Only 
warnings are so positionally marked and informationally redundant. 
Within the normal text, sentence groups dealing with each forecast 
parameter are ordered by two principles: inlrinsic interest of the data 
and implicit causal inks between the events or states described. Thus 
wind direction and speed, as the critical factors in marine conditions, 
occupy initial position. However visibility ratings, which should tbl- 
low in order of imt)ortance, occur last by virtue of their dependence 
on fog/mist descriptions, which in turn are somewhat dependent on 
precipitation, which in aim follow cloud cover ratings. Sentence 
groups are therefore ordered as follows: 
WINDS > CLOUD-COVER > PRECIP > 
FOG&MIST > VISIBILITY 
Within each sentence group, sentences and clauses are first 
ordered according to the dichotomy "general vs. local exception", and 
then chronologically within general and exceptional parts. A final 
correlate of data salience is the choice of marked Iexical items and 
modifiers. For example, particularly strong winds are classified as 
"gales" (at 35 knots), "storm force winds" (at 45 knots), etc. Also, 
more specialized sense verbs such as "veering" and "backing" tend to 
be used more for huge changes of wind direction. 
7. Temporal Reference under b~creasing Uncertainty 
Art interesting problem arises in ascribing particular time adver- 
bials to points and intervals of (local) time. There appears to be a ten- 
dency in reportS to "hedge" temporal descriptors slightly as reference 
time becomes more remote from the forecast issue time. For example, 
"Tuesday afternomf' or "by (Tuesday) evening" may be preferred for 
remote reference over the more precise "late Tuesday afternoon". 
This may reflect he increasing difficulty in predicting onset imes for 
remote meteorological events. RAREAS incorporates two varieties of 
temporal rules in order to generate more vague temporal descriptors 
for more remote vents. 
8. Bilingual Reports 
The RAREAS system was designed to accomodate the syn- 
thesis of marine weather bulletins in French as well as in English. 
Only the final three components in the processing sequence are 
language-dependent (a d only the last of these in a non-trivial way). 
Syntactic patterns and lexical enwies for French must of course be 
furnished on the basis of independent linguistic study of the 
corresponding French sublanguage. The exact semantics for French 
(correspondences between data configurations and specific lexemes) 
must be worked out separately, since there is no guarantee that 
English and French are lexically one-to-one, even in this narrow 
domain. 
Canadian weather forecasts of all varieties are currently 
translated into French by the METEO system (Chevalier et ,-d. 1978), 
developed at the Universit6 de Montr6al some ten years ago. 
Although METEO takes advantage of the relative closure and stereo.- 
typed style of forecasts, a cerxain percentage of forecast sentences 
fails analysis and hence translation. This is due not only to input 
en'ors due to typing and line noise, but also to slight irregularities in 
the usage of English grammar and lexicon on the part of forecasters, 
w/erich ave proved troublesome to foresee in a compact system. 
The automatic synthesis of marine forecasts, on the other hand, 
should eliminate the fuzzy edges of unpredictability in truman 
language production, by using a semantically complete and consistent 
subset of language to cover all foreseeable data configurations. Work 
on RAREAS thus prepares the ground ior an attractive alternaave to 
machine translation of these forecasts. The simultaneous synthesis of 
English and French forecasts directly from data would optimize the 
transfer of information to speakers of both languages, in addition to 
being (in principle) more reliable. Parallel synthesis of bilingual fore- 
casts bypasses translation altogether, and most of the system's work 
in fact serves for both languages. 
9. Implementation 
RAREAS is written in MProlog, and runs on a Vax under 
VMS as well as on PC/XT/AT compatible microcomputers. Syn- 
thesis of a complete five-area forecast (about 150 words) takes about 
half a minute for the Vax implementation a d a minute for the AT 
implementation. In either case, this is probably less than the time 
required to type or write the same forecast by hand, not to mention 
compose the same forecast from data.
