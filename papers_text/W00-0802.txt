We examine three different types of sense 
clustering criteria with an Information 
Retrieval application in mind: methods 
based on the wordnet structure (such 
as generMization, cousins, sisters...); eo- 
occurrence of senses obtained from Sere- 
cot; and equivalent translations of senses 
in other languages via the EuroWordNet 
InterLingual Index (ILI). We conclude 
that a) different NLP  applications de- 
mand not only different sense granulari- 
ties but different (possibly overlapped) 
sense clusterings, b) co-occurrence of 
senses in Semcor provide strong evidence 
for Information Retrieval clusters, un- 
like methods based on wordnet structure 
and systematic polysemy, e) parallel pol- 
ysemy in three or more languages via 
the ILI, besides providing sense clusters 
for MT and CLIR, is strongly correlated 
with co-occurring senses in Semcor, and 
thus can be useful for Information Re- 
trieval as well. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) and EuroWordNet 
(Vossen, 1998), as most large-coverage electronic 
dictionaries and semantic networks, are not de- 
signed for a specific Natural Language Process- 
ing (NLP) application. It is commonly assumed 
that sense distinctions in these lex~cal databases 
are too fine-grained for a majority of applications. 
In particular, we have used EuroWordNet in a 
Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR) applica- 
tion (Verdejo et al, 2000) and a number of CLTR 
experiments (Gonzalo et al, 1999; Vossen et al, 
1999), confirming that it is crucial to apply certain 
sense clusters to Wordnet (WN) and EuroWord- 
Net (EWN)  to take real advantage of them in 
Information Retrieval applications. Potentially, 
a semantic network such as WN/EWN can help 
distinguishing different word senses for retrieval, 
enhancing precision, and identifying synonymic 
or conceptually related terms, enhancing recall. 
But not all sense distinctions in a lexical database 
are meaningful for Information Retrieval. For in- 
stance, the following sense distinctions are super- 
fluous in an information retrieval application, as 
the different senses do not lead to different opics 
or different kinds of documents: 
Behav iour  
1. Manner of acting or conducting oneselJ 
2. (psychology) the aggreaate of the responses or 
reaction or movements made by an organism in 
any situation 
3. Behavioural attributes 
Bet  
1. The act of gambling 
2. The money risked on a gamble 
Band 
8. Instrumentalists not including string players 
9. A group of musicians playing popular music 
for dancing 
Bother  
1. Smth. or someone who causes trouble, a source 
of unhappiness 
2. An angry disturbance 
But sense clustering have been generally as- 
sociated with identifying Systematic Polysemy 
rules, taking into account lexicographic arguments 
rather than potential applications. In (Peters et 
al., 1998; Peters and Peters, 2000) the EuroWord- 
Net structure, together with systematic polysemy, 
is used to group senses (sisters, auto-hyponymy, 
cousins, twins). This work is linked to the find- 
ing of systematic polysemy classes in (Buitelaar, 
1998; Buitelaar, 2000; Tomuro, 1998) and others. 
While identifying systematic polysemy might be 
a key issue for and adequate lexico-semantic spec- 
10 
ification, systematic relatedness does not always 
mean sense proximity. In particular, such rules 
do not necessarily predict a similar behavior of 
the clustered senses in an NLP application. For in- 
stance, the animal/food systematic polysemy does 
not lead to good sense clusters neither for Machine 
Translation between English and Sp~nlsh, nor for 
Information Retrieval . In Spanish it is common 
to give different names to an animal in a zoological 
sense or in a food sense. For instance, it is nec- 
essary to distinguish animal/food senses offish in 
order to translate into pez or pes~do, depending 
on the context. And for Information Retrieval, 
the animal sense will appear in documents about, 
say, zoology, while the food sense will appear in 
documents about cooking. Therefore, while the 
animal/food rule is useful for lexical representa- 
tion and prediction of sense extensions in English, 
it cannot be used to cluster senses in MT or IR. 
In (Vossen et al, 1999) we performed a concept- 
based IR experiment where using the ILI with 
clusters was slightly worse than using the ILI with- 
out the clusters. While clustering the EWN Inter- 
lingual Index records on the basis of systematic 
polysemy proved useful to provide better inter- 
languages connectivity in the EWN database, this 
result supports the idea that systematic polysemy, 
per se, is not an indication of potential IR clusters. 
However, we do not claim that all systematic 
polysemy patterns are useless for IR. It is prob- 
ably reasonable to classify different systematic 
polysemy rules according to whether they pro- 
duce I/t clusters or not. Some, already identi- 
fied, patterns of regular polysemy, such as con- 
tainer/quantity or music/dance (Peters and Pe- 
ters, 2000) yield adequate IR clusters. Other 
patterns, such as animal/food, plant/food, aui- 
real/skin, language/people tend to produce clus- 
ters that are not valid for IR. This classification 
of polysemy patterns is, to our opinion, strongly 
related with the black and white dot operators in- 
troduced in (Buitelaar, 1998). The black operator 
was reserved for polysemy patterns including sets 
of senses that may co-occur in the same word in- 
stance (e.g. book as written work or as physical 
object), and white operator is reserved for poly- 
semy patterns for senses that never co-occur in 
the same word instance (e.g. window as physi- 
cal object or as computer frame): Unfortunately, 
the distinction between black and white operators 
classes has not been applied yet -to our knowl- 
edge - to the set of polysemous classes defined in 
Buitelaar's thesis. 
But, in many cases, even useful polysemy 
rules fail to extract pairs of systematically re- 
lated senses in WN/BWN, because the hypernym 
branches that they pertain to do not obey none of 
the described systematic polysemy classes/types. 
Take the following example: 
sack: 
1. The act of terminating someone's employment 
TERMINATION, END, CONCLUSION 
2. a bag made of paper or plastic for holding 
customer purchases -.h BAG 
3. unwai.~ed loose-fitting dress hanging straight 
from the shoulders --~ DRESS, FROCK 
4. hanging bed of canvas or rope netting -4 BED 
5. a woman's full loose hip-length jacket -~ 
JACKET 
6. dry white wine from SW Europe ~ WHITE 
WINE 
7. quantity contained in a sack ~ CONTAINER- 
FUL 
8. pocket. --~ ENCLOSED SPACE 
sack 2 (bag of paper for customer's pur- 
chases) and sack 7 (quantity contained in a 
sack) are related by systematic polysemy as con- 
tainer/containerful. Similarly, sack 8 (pocket) 
should be related to some sense with the mean- 
ing of quantity. Nevertheless, ack 8, whose hy- 
pernym is "enclosed space", cannot be retained in 
the same way that the former pair of senses, in 
spite of identical semantic relationship. System- 
atic polysemy cannot predict, as well, a poten- 
tial IR duster with senses 3 and 5 (both meaning 
types of clothing and thus likely to appear in shn- 
ilar contexts). Senses 3 and 5 indicate, also, that 
clustering might also depend on the application 
domain: they can be clustered in a genetic search, 
but they should be distinguished if the search is 
performed in a clothing domain. 
It is interesting to note, finally, that different 
clustering criteria not only lead to different gran- 
ularities, but they can produce tangled clusters, 
as in  
Onion:  
1. Pungent bulb -+ VEGETABLE ~ FOOD 
2. Bulbuos plant having hollow leaves cultivated 
worldwide for its rounded edible bulb --~ ALLIA- 
CEOUS PLANT ~ PLANT 
3. Edible bulb of an onion plant ~ BULB 
PLANT ORGAN 
The plant/food rule successfully relates senses 
2 and 1, while for Information Retrieval the inter- 
esting cluster is for senses 2 and 3, (both botanical 
terms). 
11 
Our hypothesis i , therefore, that we cannot as- 
sume general clustering criteria; different NLP ap- 
plications require different clustering criteria that 
are difficult to reconcile in a single clustering ap- 
proach. Our work on clustering is centered on 
identifying sense-distinctions that could be rel- 
evant from an Information Retriev'~t and Cross 
Language Information Retrieval point of view. 
Next section describes a clustering strategy that 
adequates to the Information Retrieval criterion: 
cluster senses if they tend to co-occur in the same 
Semcor documents. 
In Section 3, we study a different clustering ceil- 
teflon, based on equivalent ranslations for two 
or  more senses in other wordnets fi'om the Eu- 
roWordNet database. This is a direct criterion 
to duster senses in Machine Translation or Cross- 
Language Text Retrieval. Then we measure the 
overlap between both criteria, to conclude that the 
EWN InterLingual Index is also a valuable source 
of evidence for Information Retrieval clusters. 
2 Cluster evidence from Semcor 
One of our goals within the EuroWordNet and 
ITEM projects was to provide sense clusterings 
for WordNet (and, in general,for the EuroWord- 
Net InterLingual Index, (Gonzalo et al, 1999) 
that leave only the sense distinctions in wordnets 
that indicate different (semantic) indexing units 
for Information Retrieval. Our first lexicographic 
examination of WordNet sense distinctions and 
ciustefings following criteria based on the wordnet 
hierarchy did not produce clear criteria to classify 
senses emi-automatically according to this ~ re- 
quirement. As we mentioned before, the clusters 
applied on the EWN InterLingual Index which re- 
lied solely on hierarchical information in Word- 
net, produced a slight decrease of retrieval per- 
formauce in an experiment using 1LI records as 
indexing units. 
Thus, we decided to stick to our only clear-cut 
criterion: cluster senses if they are likely to co- 
occur in the same document. The fact that the 
same sense combination occurs in several seman- 
tically tagged documents hould provide strong 
evidence for clustering. Fortunately, we had the 
Semcor corpus of semantically-tagged documents 
to start with. 
For example, the first two senses of "breath" 
co-occur in several Semcor documents: 
Breath  
1. (the air that is inhaled or exhaled in respira- 
tion) 
2. (the act of exhaling) 
This co-occurrence indicates that this sense dis- 
tinction ~ not help to discriminate different doc- 
ument contexts. While in this particular exam- 
ple there is a clear relation between senses (sense 
1 is involved in the action specified in sense 2), 
it seems extremely difficult to find general clus- 
tering techniques based on Word.Net hierarchy to 
capture all potential IR clusters. 
We have scanned Semcor in search of sets of 
(two or more) senses that co-occur frequently 
enough. In practice, we started with a thresh- 
old of at least 2 documents (out of 171) with 
the co-occurring senses in a similar distribution. 
We did not use the original Semcor files, but the 
IR-Semcor partition (Gonzalo et al, 1998) that 
splits multi-text documents into coherent retrieval 
chunks. We completed this list of candidates to 
cluster with pairs of senses that only co-occur once 
but belong to any "cousin" combination (Peters et 
al., 1998). Finally, we obtained 507 sets of sense 
combinations (producing above 650 sense pairs) 
for which Semcor provides positive evidence for 
clustering. A manual verification of 50 of such 
clusters howed that above 70% of them were use- 
ful. We also noticed that raising the threshold 
(the number of documents in which the senses co- 
occur), the error rate decreases quickly. 
Then we worked with this set of positive IR clus- 
ters, trying to identify a set of common features 
that could be used to cluster the rest of WN/EWN 
senses. However, it seems extremely difficult to 
find any single criterion, common to all clusters. 
For instance, if we consider a) number of vari- 
ants in common between the synsets correspond- 
ing to the candidate senses; b) number of words 
in common between the glosses; and c) common 
hypernyms, we find that any combination of val- 
ues for these three features is likely to be found 
among the set of clusters inferred from Semcor. 
For example: 
fact 
I. a piece of information about circurastances 
that ezist or events that have occurred; "first you 
must collect all the facts of the case" 
~. a statement or assertion of verified infor- 
mation about something that is the case or has 
happened; "he supported his argument with an 
impressive array of facts" 
Number of documents in which they co-occur: 13 
a) number of variants in common: 1 out of 1 
b) (content) words in common between flosses: 
yes 
c) common hypernyms: no 
12 
door  
1. door -(a swinging or sliding barrier that will 
close the entrance to a room or building; "he 
knocked on the door"; "he slammed the door as 
he left") 2. doorway, door, entree, entry, portal, 
room access'- (the space in a wall through which 
you enter or leave a room or building; the space 
that a door can close; "he stuck his head in the 
doorway") Number of documents in which they 
co-occur: 11 
a} number of variants in common: I out of 6 
b} (content} words in common between glosses: 
yes (also XPOS: enter/entrance} 
c} common hypernyras: yes 
way 
1. manner, mode, style, way, fashion - (a 
manner of performance; "a manner of living"; 
"a way of life") 2. means, way - (how a result 
is obtained or an end is achieved; "a means 
of communication"; "the true way to success") 
Number of documents in which they co-occur: 9 
a) number of variants in common: I out of 6 
b) (content) words in common between glosses: 
no 
c) common hypernyms: no 
The next logical step is to use this positive ev- 
idence, combined with negative co-occurrence ev- 
idence, in training some machine learning system 
that can successfully capture the regularities hid- 
den to our manual inspection. In principle, a bi- 
nary classification task would be easy to capture 
by decision trees or similar techniques. 
Therefore, we have also extracted from Sea-  
cot combinations of senses that appear frequently 
enough in Semcor, but never appear together in 
the same document. The threshold was set in, 
at least, 8 occurrences of each sense in Semcor, 
resulting in more than 500 negative clusters. A 
manual verification of 50 of these negative clusters 
showed that about 80% of them were acceptable 
for Information Retrieval as senses that should 
be distinguished. Together with the positive evi- 
dence, we have more than 1100 training cases for 
a binary classifier. Our plan is to apply this clas- 
sifter to the whole EWN InterLingual Index, and 
then perform precision/recall tests in the environ- 
ment described in (Gonzalo et al, 1998; Gonzalo 
et al, 1999). 
3 C lus ter  ev idence  f rom the  I L I  
When translated into a target language, sense dis- 
tinctions of a word may be lexicalized. For in- 
stance, the English term spring is translated into 
Spanish as primavera in its "season" sense, into 
muelle in its "metal device" sense, or as flaente 
in its "fountain" sense. For an English-Spanish 
Machine Translation system, it is crucial to dis- 
tinguish these three senses of spring. But it is 
also frequent hat two or more senses of a word 
are translated into the same word, for one or more 
languages. For instance, child as "human offspring 
(son or daughter) of any age" and child as "young 
male person" are both translated into "nifio" in 
Spanish, into "enfant" in French, and into "kind" 
in German. We will use the term "parallel poly- 
semy" to refer to this situation in the rest of this 
article. 
Obviously, a Machine Translation system does 
not need to distinguish these two senses. But it is 
also tempting to hypothesize that the existence of 
parallel polysemy in two or more target languages 
may indicate that the two senses are close enough 
to be clustered in more applications. Indeed, in 
(Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) this criterion is pro- 
posed to determine which word senses hould be 
retained or discarded in a testbed for automatic 
Word Sense Disambiguation systems. 
In particular, our goal has been to test whether 
two or more senses of a word are likely to be clus- 
tered, for IR purposes, if they have parallel pol- 
ysemy in a certain number of languages via the 
EuroWorclNet InterLingual Indez. If the answer 
is positive, then the InterLingual Index, with eight 
languages interconnected, would be a rich source 
of information to provide IR clusters. In EWN, 
each monolingual database is linked, via Cross- 
Language quivalence relations, to the InterLin- 
gual Index (ILI) which is the superset of all con- 
cepts occurring in all languages. The ILI permits 
finding equivalent synsets between any pair of lan- 
guages included in the database. For instance, 
senses 1 and 2 of child are translated into Span- 
ish, French and German as follows: 
Chi ld 
child 1 -r  {child, kid} - (a human offspring (son 
or daughter) of any age; "they had three children"; 
"they were able to send their kids to college") 
child 2 --~ {male child, boy, child} - (a young 
male person; "the baby was a boy"; "she made the 
boy brush his teeth every night") 
Spanish: 
{child, kid} EQ-SYNONYM {ni~o, cr~o, menor} 
13 
{male child, boy, child} EQ-SYNON'YM {nino} 
lwencch: 
{child, kid} EQ-SYNONYM{ en.fant, mineur} 
{male child, boy, child} EQ-SYNONYM{en\]ant) 
German: 
{child, kid} EQ-SYNONYM {kind} 
{mate child, boy, child} EQ-SYNOrCYM {kind, 
spross} 
Note that child I and child ~ have parallel trans- 
lations in all three languages: Sp~mish (nifio), 
French (enfant) and German (kind). In this case, 
this criterion successfully detects a \])air of senses 
that could be clustered for Information Retrieval 
purposes. 
In order to test the general validity of this cri- 
terion, we have followed these steps: 
Select a set of nouns for a full manual study. 
We have chosen the set of 22 nouns used 
in the first SENSEVAL competition (Kilgar- 
rift and Palmer, 2000). This set satisfied 
our requirements of size (small enough for an 
exhaustive manual revision), reasonable de- 
gree of polysemy, and unbiased for our test- 
ing purposes (the criteria to select these 22 
nouns was obviously independent of our ex- 
periment). We had to reduce the original 
set to 20 nouns (corresponding to 73 EWN 
senses), as the other two nouns were polyse- 
mous in the Hector database used for SEN- 
SEVAL, but monosemous in WordNet 1.5 and 
EuroWordNet. As target languages we chose 
Spanish, French, Dutch and German. 
Extract the candidate senses that satisfy the 
parallel polysemy criterion, in three variants: 
- Experiment 1: sets of senses that have 
parallel translations in at least two out 
of the four target languages. 
- Experiment 2: sets of senses that have 
parallel translations in at least one out 
of the four target languages. This is a 
softer constraint that produces a super- 
set of the sense clusters Obtained in Ex- 
periment 1. 
-Experhnent 3: sets of senses whose 
synsets are mapped into the same target 
synset for at least one of the target lan- 
guages. This criterion cannot be tested 
on plain multilingual dictionaries, only 
on EWN-like semantic databases. 
? Check out manually whether the dusters pro- 
duced in Experiments 1-3 are valid for Infor- 
mation Retrieval. At this step, the validity of 
clusters was checked by a human judge. Un- 
fortunately, we did not have the chance yet to 
attest the validity of these judgments using 
more judges and extracting inter-annotator 
agreement rates. We could compare anno- 
tations only on a small ~action of cases (15 
sense pairs), which we use to make the crite- 
rion "valid for Itt" precise nough for reliable 
annotation. The results are reported in sec- 
tions 3.2-3.4 for the different experiments. 
? Identify all possible lexicographic reasons be- 
hind a parallel polysemy, taking advantage of
the previous study. This is reported in the 
next section. 
? Check how many clusters obtained from Sem- 
cor also satisfy the parallel translation crite- 
rion, to have an idea of the overlap between 
both (section 3.5). 
? Finally, study whether the results have a de- 
pendency on possible incompleteness or in- 
adequacy of the InterLingual I.udex (section 
3.6). 
3.1 Typo logy  of  para l le l  po lysemy 
Parallel polysemy can also be a sign of some sys- 
tematic relation between the senses. As it is said 
in (Seto, 1996), ~(..) There often is a one-to- 
one correspondence b tween different languages in 
their lexiealization behaviour towards metonyrny, 
in other words, metonymically related word senses 
are often translated by the same word in other lan- 
guages". 
But the reasons for parallel polysemy are not 
limited only to systematic polysemy. In the case 
of the EWN database, we have distinguished the 
following causes: 
1. There is a series of mechanisms of meaning 
extension, if not universal, at least, common 
to several languages: 
(a) General lzat ion/special l  =ation For 
example, the following two senses for 
band: 
English: band; French: groupe; Ger- 
man: Band, Mnsicgruppe 
1. Instrumentalists not including string 
players 
2. A group of musicians playing popular 
music for dancing 
14 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
Sense 1 is a specialization ofSense 2, and 
this pattern is repeated in French and 
German. 
Metonymic  relat ions.  Some of them 
form already will known systematic pol- 
ysemy patterns. As for applicability to 
IR, we should be capable to discrimi- 
nate regular polysemy rules that provide 
valid IR clusters from those that contain 
senses that can not be interpreted simul- 
taneously within a same document. Ex- 
amples include: 
English: glass; Spanish: vaso 
1. container 
2. quantity 
which is a valid IR cluster, and 
English: rabbit; 
l~rench: lapin 
1.mammal 
2.meat 
Spanish: conejo; 
which should be distinguished for IR. 
Metaphors .  This kind of semantic re- 
lation usually does not produce good IR 
clusters, because senses related by means 
of metaphor usually belong to different 
semantic fields and, consequently, tend 
to occur in distinct documents. For ex- 
ample: 
English: giant; Spanish: coloso; French: 
colosse; Dutch: kolossus 
1.a person of exceptional importance and 
reputation 
2.someone who is abnormally large 
Semant ic  caique or loan transla- 
tion. A (probably metaphorical) sense 
extension is copied in other languages. 
It also can produce undesirable clusters 
for Ilt, because the original relation be- 
tween two senses involved can be based 
on a metaphor. For example: 
English: window; Spanish: ventana; 
Dutch: venster. 
1.an opening in the wall of a building to 
admit light and air 
2.a rectangular pert of a computer screen 
that is a display different of the rest of 
the screen 
The original computer sense for window 
is also adopted in Spanish and German 
2. 
for the corresponding words ventana nd 
venster. 
In certain occasions, the particularities of 
how the wordnets have been built semi- 
automatically ead to a mimesis of the WN1.5 
senses and, consequently, to parallel poly- 
semy in several anguages. These sense dis- 
tinctious are not incorrect, but perhaps would 
be different if every monolingual wordnet had 
been constructed without WN 1.5 as a refer- 
ence for semi-automatic extraction of seman- 
tic relations. An example: 
Behaviottr: 
1. Manner of acting or conducting oneself 
(Spanish: compertamiento, conducta; 
French: comportement, conduite) 
2. (psychology) the aggregate of the responses 
or reaction or movements made by an organ- 
ism in any situation 
(Spanish: comportamiento, conducta; 
French: comportement) 
3. Beehavioural ttributes 
(Spanish: comportamiento, conducta; 
French: comportement) 
The question is what classes of parallel poly- 
semy are dominant in EWN, and then whether 
parallel polysemy can be taken as a strong indi- 
cation of a potential IR cluster. A preliminary 
answer to this question is reported in the next 
sections. 
3.2 Exper iment 1 
Here we selected all sense combinations, in our 20 
English nouns test set, that had parallel transla- 
tions in at least two of the four target languages 
considered (Spanish, French, Dutch and German). 
We found 10 clusters: 6 were appropriate for In- 
formation Retrieval, 3 were judged inappropriate, 
and one was due to an error in the database: 
Val id I t t  c lusters 
Band 1,2: something elongated, worn around 
the body or one of the limbs / a strip or stripe of 
a contrasting color or material (mapped into two 
different syusets in Spani.~h and French) 
band 2,5: a strip or stripe of a contrasting 
color or material/a stripe of a contrasting color 
(mapped into different syusets in Spanish and 
French; only one translation into Dutch.) 
band 8,9: instrumentalists not including string 
players / a group of musicians playing popular 
15 
music for dancing (linked to the s~mae synset in 
German and in Dutch) 
behaviour 1,2,3: manner of acting or con- 
ducting oneself /(psychology) the aggregate of 
the responses or reaction or movements made 
by an organism in any situation / bchavioural 
attributes (two senses are sisters, and in general 
the distinction is not easy to understand; in two 
cases the Dutch synset is the same, and there is 
no Dutch translation for the other. In Sp~nigh 
there are three synsets that mimic the English 
ones). 
Bet 1,~: act of gambling/money risked 
(metonymy relation, translated iaato different 
synsets in Spanish and French. One or both 
translations missing for the other languages) 
ezcess 3,4: surplusage / overabundance (differ- 
ent synsets in Spanish and French, one or both 
translations missing in the other languages). 
inappropriate c lusters  
giant 5,6: a person off exceptional importance 
/ someone who is abnormally large (metaphoric 
relation; linked to the same syuset in Dutch, and 
to different synsets in Spanish and French) 
giant 5,7: a person of ezceptional importance / 
a very large person (metaphoric relation; linked 
to different synsets in Dutch and German) 
rabbit 1,2: mammal / meat (systematic poly- 
semy; linked to different syusets in Spanish, Ger- 
man and French). 
E r roneous  cluster 
steer 1,2: castrated bull/ hint, indication off 
potential opportunity. Both are translated into 
"buey" in Spanish and into "stierkalf ~in Dutch. 
Only the "castrated bull" --~ "buey" link is appro- 
priate. 
3.3 Exper iment  2 
If we take all clusters that have a parallel transla- 
tion in at least one target language (rather than 
two target languages as in Experiment 1), we ob- 
tain a larger subset of 27 clusters. The 17 new 
clusters have the following distribution: 
? 9 valid clusters, such as bother 1,2 (something 
that causes trouble / angry disturbance). 
? 3 inappropriate clusters that relate 
homonyms, such as band 2,7 (strip or stripe 
of a contrasting color or material/unofHcial 
association of people). 
? 4 inappropriate clusters that group 
metonymieally related senses, such as 
sanction 2,3 (penalty/authorization). 
? I inappropriate cluster based on a metaphor: 
steering 2,3 (act of steering and holding the 
course/guiding, uidance) 
On the overall, we have 15 valid clusters, 11 
inappropriate, and one error. The percentage of 
useful predictions i  56%, only slightly worse than 
for the tighter constraint of experiment 1. It is 
worth noticing that: 
1. The parallel translation criterion obtained 27 
potential clusters for 20 nouns, nearly one 
and a half cluster per noun. The criterion 
is very productive! 
2. The percentage of incorrect clusters (41%) 
is high enough to suggest hat parallel poly- 
semy cannot be taken as a golden rule to clus- 
ter close senses, at least with the languages 
studied. Even 3 of the negative cases were 
homonyms, totally unrelated senses. Perhaps 
the general WSD clustering criterion pro- 
posed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) needs 
to be revised for a specific application such 
as IR. For instance, they argue that dusters 
based on parallel polysemy "would eliminate 
many distinctions that are arguably better 
treated as regular polysemy'. But we have 
seen that regular polysemy may lead to sense 
distinctions that are important o keep in an 
Information Retrieval application. On the 
other hand, the results reported in (Resnik 
and Yarowsky, 1999) suggest hat we would 
obtain better clusters if the parallel polysemy 
criteria is tested on more distant languages, 
such as Japanese or Basque to test English 
sense distinctions. 
3.4 Exper iment  3 
In this experiment, which cannot be done with a 
multilingual dictionary, we looked for sense dis- 
tinctions that are translated into the same synset 
for some target language. This is a direct evidence 
of sense relatedness (both senses point to the same 
concept in the target language), although the rela- 
tion may be complex (for instance, one of the two 
senses might be translated as an EQ-HYPONYM). 
We found 9 clusters atisfying the criterion, all 
of them for linlcq to the Dutch wordnet. 5 sense 
combinations are valid IR clusters. Three com- 
binations turned out to be inappropriate for the

of exceptional importance / someone who is ab- 
normally large). Finally, the erroneous cluster for 
steerl (castrated bull) and steer2 (hint, an indica- 
tion of potential opportunity) reappeared again. 
The results for the three experiments are sum- 
mazized in Table 1. It seems that the parallel 
polysemy criteria on the ILI can be a very rich 
source of information to cluster senses for IR, but 
it is as well obvious that it needs to be refined or 
manually revised to obtain high quality clusters. 
3.5 Overlapping of  criteria f rom Semcor  
to ILI 
To complete evidence for correlation between 
Semcor-based clusters and ILI-based clusters, we 
studied two subsets of Semcor-based clusters to 
check if they matched the parallel polysemy crite- 
ria on the ILI. The first set were the 11 sense com- 
binatious with a co-occurrence frequency above 7 
in Semcor. 10 out of 11 (91%) also hold the most 
restrictive criterion used in Experiment 1, again 
indicating a strong correlation between both cri- 
teria. Then we augmented the set of sense com- 
binations to 50 - with co-occurrence frequencies 
above 2-. This time, 27 clusters matched the cri- 
terion in Experiment 2 (54%). As the evidence 
for Semcor clustering decreases, the criterion of 
parallel translations i also less reliable, again in- 
dicating a correlation between both. 
3.6 Adequacy  of the IL I  to get  
tr-n~lat ion clusters 
Clustering methods based on the criterion of par- 
allel translation depend, to a great extent, on 
the adequacy and quality of the lexical resources 
used. How many ILI clusters had we obtained in 
an EWN database with total coverage and com- 
pletely error-free? 
Our experiments, though limited, are a first in- 
dication of the utility of EWN for this task: 
? Analyzing 73 WN senses corresponding to 20 
nouns used in the SENSEVAL, we found 2 er- 
roneons equivalence links in the Spanish and 
Dutch wordnets. Taking into account hat 
EWN was built by semi-automatic means, 
this seems a low error rate. 
Only 16 senses out of 73 have equivalence 
links in the 4 selected wordnets. 19 senses 
have equivalence \]ink,q in 3 languages, 21 
senses in 2 languages, 9 in only one language 
and 6 have no equivalence links in any of the 
selected worduets. The lack of equivalence 
links sometimes can be explained by the lack 
of lexicalized terms for a certain WN concept. 
For example, float2 (a drink with ice-cream 
floating in it) is not lexicalized in Spanish, so 
we should not expect an equivalence link for 
this sense in the Spanish wordnet. In many 
other cases though, the lack of the equiva- 
lence links is due to incompleteness in the 
database. 
Each monolingual wordnet reflects, to a 
large extent, the kind of Machine-Readable 
resources used to build it. The Span- 
ish wordnet was built mainly from bilin- 
gual dictionaries and therefore is closer to 
the Wn 1.5 structure. The French word- 
net departed from an ontology-like database, 
and thus some non-lexicaliT.ed expressions 
are still present (for instance, float ~ has 
soda_avec_un_boule_de_glace as French equiv- 
alent). The Dutch wordnet departed from a 
lexical database rich in semantic information, 
thus it departs more from the Wordnet struc- 
ture, has a richer connectivity and complex 
links into the InterLingual Index, etc. Cross- 
Language quivalent relations are not, there- 
fore, totally homogeneous in EWN. 
On the overall, however, the ILI seems per- 
fectly suitable for automatic applications regard- 
ing multilingual sense mappings. In particular, 
the fine-grainedness of Wordnet and EuroWord- 
Net, in spite of its lack of popularity among NLP 
researchers, may be an advantage for NLP appli- 
cations, as it may suit different clusterings for dif- 
ferent application requirements.

4 Conc lus ions  
We examined three different ypes of sense clus- 
tering criteria with an Information Retrieval ap- 
plication in mind: methods based on the word- 
net structure (such as generalization, cousins, sis- 
ters...); co-occurrence of senses obtained from 
Semcor; and equivalent translations of senses in 
other languages via the EuroWordNet InterLin- 
gual Index (ILI). We conclude that a) different 
NLP  applications demand not only different sense 
granularities but different (possibly overlapped) 
sense elusterings, b) co-occurrence of senses in 
Semcor provide strong evidence for Information 
Retrieval clusters, unlike methods based on word- 
net structure and systematic polysemy, c) parallel 
polysemy in two or more languages via the ILI, be- 
sides providing sense clusters for MT and CLIR, is 
correlated with coocurring senses in Semcor, and 
thus can be useful to obtain IR dusters as well. 
Both approaches to IR clusters fbr WN/EWN 
(evidence from Semcor and from the ILl) seem 
very promising. The positive and negative evi- 
dence from SeIncor (above 500 clusters each) can 
possibly be used in a Machine Learning approach 
to find additional dusters for the rem~inlng sense 
distinctions without enough evidence from Sere- 
cot. The parallel polysemy criteria, over EWN,  is 
highly productive (more than one candidate per 
word in our experiments), although a more diverse 
set of languages would probably produce a higher 
rate of valid clusters.
