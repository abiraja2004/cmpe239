Abstract 
In this paper we address the organization and use of the 
lexicon giving special consideration tohow the salience 
of certain aspects of abstract semantic structure may 
be expressed. We propose an organization of the lex- 
icon and its interaction with grammar and knowledge 
that makes extensive use of lexical functions from the 
Meaning-Text-Theory f Mel'~uk. We integrate this ap- 
proach with the architecture of the PENMAN text gen- 
eration system, showing some areas where that archi- 
tecture is insufficient, and illustrating how the lexicon 
can provide functionally oriented guidance for the gen- 
eration process. 
Introduction 
In natural language generation, the lexicon can be 
viewed, generally, as containing information for the 
verbalization of meanings. This information ranges 
over both the static organization of vocabulary - -  
including lexical knowledge, often handled separately 
as "lexical semantics" (see, e.g., \[Pustejovsky, 1988; 
Nirenburg and Raskin, 1987\]) or "structural semantics" 
- -  and the process of lexical choice. To make allowance 
for this latter dynamic aspect of the lexical organiza- 
tion we will henceforth use the term lexis common in 
systemic linguistics \[Hasan, 1987; Matthiessen, 1988\] 
instead of "lexicon". Lexis thus represents lexical infor- 
mation at various different levels of abstraction (strata) 
and mapping structures that provide for the conversion 
between those levels. In this paper we address the or- 
ganization of lexis giving special consideration to the 
expresssion and choice of appropriate expressions as a 
function of the desired salience or prominence ofseman- 
tic elements. The choice set of possible configurations 
of prominence we call the perspectives ofthe semantic 
structure. 
These have been addressed rarely in approaches in
generation so far: for example, \[Jacobs, 1985\] discusses 
the verbs give and take as two different expressions of 
the same event; \[Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988\] sug- 
gest an approach to open-class lexical item selection for 
realization of conceptual input; and \[Iordanskaja et al,

1988\] propose an approach to linguistic paraphrasing 
by adapting the Meaning-Text-Theory (MTT) \[Mel'~uk 
and Zholkovsky, 1970\] and its paraphrasing rules. Here, 
we make more extensive use of the MTT in order to 
provide a richer organization oflexis and its interaction 
with grammar and knowledge than has been proposed 
previously. Moreover, we develop this approach in the 
context of a concrete generation environment, the PEN- 
MAN system \[Mann and Matthiessen, 1985\], showing 
some areas where the existing architecture is insufficient 
and how the richer organization oflexis we propose can 
help. 
The following set of examples gives an impression of 
the variety of linguistic phenomena that we include un- 
der the term perspective. 1 All the sentences can be in- 
terpreted as verbalizations ofa single abstract semantic 
structure with differing aspects of that structfire being 
given emphasis in each case. For example, in (4), the 
reader is made salient as a participant of the propo- 
sition; in (5), the 'manner of achievement' of the 'in- 
dication' is made salient; in (7), a particular temporal 
aspect of the process, namely the beginning, is made 
prominentput; and in (8), the intended purpose of the 
agent is made salient as a 'making clear'. While the 
variation that can be seen between (1), (2), and (3) can 
already be treated in, for example, the current PEN- 
MAN system by exercising meaning options available in 
the grammar (i.e., (2) exhibits passivization and (3) 
nominalization f 'use'), the variation shown in the re- 
maining examples cannot be functionally motivated as 
possible alternate grammatical realizations of the base 
semantic form.

Some of the phenomena running through these ex- 
amples have been treated as lexleal eooeeurrenee 
\[Apresjan et al, 1969\] or collocation \[Firth, 1957; 
Halliday, 1966; Hausmann, 1985\]). Most extensively 
they are handled by I. Mel'~uk et al in the scope of 
the Meaning-Text-Theory b  means of lexleal func- 
tions (LFs). Our approach to generating this range 
of variation takes its starting point, therefore, from 
the notion of lexical cooccurrence r lations addressed 
by Mel'~uk. There is a large body of descriptive work 
based on the notion of LFs which has been carried out 
for different languages \[Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1984; 
Mel'~uk et al, 1988; Zholkovsky, 1970; Reuther, 1978; 
Janus, 1971\] and we will suggest how this body of 
knowledge can now provide significant input to work 
on text generation. 
In the next section we give an introduction to LFs as 
the means by which lexical cooccurrence dependencies 
are expressed within the MTT; we then describe some 
problems with the existing organization of LFs as de- 
fined by Mel'~uk eta/. and show how that organization 
can be developed further to be used for the modeling of 
various perspectives. In the section following, we then 
discuss the influence of lexis, when enriched by perspec- 
tives, on the generation process and, subsequently, we 
present a detailed example of the guidance this pro- 
vides. 
The Nature and Organization of Lexical 
Functions 
Lexical cooccurrence in the scope of MTT is provided 
in terms of lexical functions which Mel'~uk defines as 
follows \[Mel'~uk and Polgu6re, 1987\]: 
aA lexical ~_nction f is a dependency that associates with 
lexeme L, called the argument of f, another iexeme 
(or a set of (quasi.)synonymous iexemes) L' which ex- 
presses, with respect to L, a very abstract meaning ( . . . )  
and plays a specific syntactic role. For instance, tor a 
noun N-denoting an action, the LF Opera specifies a 
verb ( . . . )  which takes as its grammatical subject the 
name of the agent of the said action and as its direct 
object, the lexeme N itself. 
The values for any particular application of a LF to a 
lexeme are provided by an Explanatory Combina- 
torial Dict ionary (ECD); dictionaries of this type for 
a number of languages have already been compiled by 
MTT researchers. Thus, for example, the ECD for En- 
glish provides for the following applications of the LF 
Operl: 
Operl (influence) = exert 
Operl (punishment} = administer 
These give lexical verbs appropriate for use when the 
argument is to appear as a direct object o form a com- 
bination where an agent (optionally) acts upon some 
patient; e.g.: He exerted influence on P . . . ,  He ad- 
ministered a punishment . . . ,  but not, * he exerted a 
punishment . . . ,  * he administered an influence . . . .  
Cooccurrence r lations of this kind are pervasive in 
natural anguage and need to be captured in the rep- 
resentation of a language's lexical resources. Such co- 
occurrence relations can be rather arbitrary and so are 
unlikely to be supportable by, for example, distinctions 
maintained in the knowledge base. Their meaning is 
not, however, arbitrary. An important claim of MTT is 
that each LF represents a particular abstract meaning 
which remains invariant across its various applications. 
Thus, for example, further LFs include: Fuse0 with 
the meaning 'something takes place' (Func0 (accident) 
= {occur, happen}, as in the sentence: The accident 
occured two hours ago.); Result standing for a state 
following the process addressed (Result (study) = mas- 
ter, as in the sentence: John mastered his subject.); and 
Liqu expressing an active process termination. This 
latter LF is often used in so called composed LFs where 
a number of LFs are combined in a predefined order 
(LiquFunc0 (Fire) = {extinguish, put out}, as in the 
sentence: The fire brigade could put out the fire quickly). 
MTT classifies LFs into two general types: lex- 
ieal parameters,  which provide syntagmatie r la- 
tionships (e.g., Operi with i = 1,2,...), and lexi- 
eal substitutes, which provide paradigmatic relation- 
ships (e.g., Gener - -  a specific generalization rela- 
tion) \[Mel'~uk and Zholkovsky, 1970\]. However, since 
LFs typically correspond to knowledge at varying lev- 
els of abstraction in addition to lexical information, 
these classes are still very heterogenous. Previous ap- 
roaches that have made use of LFs in generation (e.g., 
ittredge and Mel'~uk, 1983; Iordanskaja et al, 1988; 
Bourbean et al, 1989\]) have been hindered by this. In 
order to exploit the notion of LFs in generation more 
extensively, we need further organizational principles 
that emphasize the meanings distinct LFs possess. 
Work in progress at IPSI suggests that the large num- 
ber of heterogeneous LFs used within MTT can be or- 
ganized coherently in terms of the functions and seman- 
tic distinctions that they represent. Based on this, we 
have defined part of a general model of lexis with a 
taxonomic organization underlying it, within which the 
most general structures provide the representations of 
lexical semantics and the most delicate ones lexicaliza- 
tion. For the purposes of this paper, we will restrict 
attention to the organization of LFs that are particu- 
larly relevant for modeling situation perspectives a il- 
lustrated in our examples above. In Figure 1 we set out 
32 
in network form general distinctive features that clas- 
sify the meaning that the LFs we discuss here cover. 2
The network explicates LFs by classifying each of them 
according to a particular set of semantic features. The 
general function of the network is thus to relate partic- 
ular LFs to the functional conditions for their applica- 
tion. This defines the meaning that any LF expresses 
and so provides a functionally organized key into the 
LF-oriented ictionaries being developed within MTT. 
The network also shows the hierarchical arrangement 
lying behind the meaning of LFs and so reflects the 
relation of perspectives to one another. 
We will now briefly describe in semantic terms a rep- 
resentative set of the LFs covered by the network, show- 
ing how the network relates perspectival presentation 
decisions to choices of LFs. 3 Then, with the organiza- 
tional network of perspectives in place and motivated, 
we show how it can be used to guide the generation 
process to produce the kinds of variation illustrated in 
(1)-(9). 
S i tuat ion  in t roduct ion  
One of the basic terms used in the scope of MTT is 
that of abstract situations, circumscribed, roughly, as 
something that takes place. In the sense of Mel'~uk, 
abstract situations are defined by key  te rms and the 
participants of the situations; the key term is designated 
by the LF So, the participants as Si (i-th participant 
of the situation). We view this construct here as an 
abstract semantic partial specification of what is to be 
expressed linguistically. Thus, looking at the situation 
of teaching, the ECD for English offers us: 
So (teaching) = teaching, 
$1 (teaching) = teacher, 
SO (teaching) = pupil. 
The notion of situational key terms is closely related to 
term of processes in the tradition of Systemic Functional 
Grammar \[tlalliday, 1985; Steiner et al, 1987\]. 
When a situation is introduced, this may be done re- 
specting a number of varying attributions Of salience 
e.g., the salience of particular participants of a situation 
or the situation itself. 
The selection of particular combinations of process 
and participants for the realization of abstract situa- 
2The notation of Figure 1 follows that used within the 
NIGEL grammar of the PENMAN system for the specification 
of grammar possibilities. Names in capitals represent the 
names of choice points, and names in lower case features 
which may be selected: one from each choice point; also 
square brackets represent disjunction of features and braces 
conjunction. Such networks can be readily expressed in 
a number of distinct formalisms, e.g., FUG (cf. \[Kasper, 
1988\]), LOOM (cf. \[Kasper, 19895\]). 
3In the full version of this network, the consequences of 
each possible selection of features for LF selection is spec- 
ified; space precludes a detailed discussion at this point, 
although examples are given below. 
tions according to differing attributions of salience is 
then provided in the scope of the ECD by LFs of vari- 
ous groups. For example: Func, which has the effect of 
attributing salience to the term labeling the situation; 
Oper ,  which has the effect of attributing salience to 
one of the participants; and Labor  which has the ef- 
fect of attributing salience to a combination of the par- 
ticipants. The selection of these broad groups is made 
in the network by the choices available under SITUA- 
TIONAL ORIENTATION, by the features 'situation ori- 
ented' (Func) and 'participant oriented' (Oper, Labor). 
These are further differentiated according to which 
participants are affected; e.g.: Operl makes the 'first' 
participant of the situation salient (i.e., the participant 
for which the LF $1 provides a lexeme) and Oper2 the 
'second' (i.e., the participant for which the LF $2 pro- 
vides a lexeme): Oper2 (influence) = be under. Simi- 
larly, Func0 makes the key term of the situation itself 
salient, while Func: introduces the situation with par- 
ticular respect o the first participant: Func0 (problem) 
= exist, FUnCl (problem) = come \[from\]. Labor12 makes 
the first and the second participant salient, the first 
more then the second, Labor21, on the contrary, makes 
the second participant more salient, e.g.: Laborl2 (pres- 
sure) = bring to bear \[on\], Labor21 (pressure) = get 
\[from\]. These options are controlled by the further se- 
lections of participants to be accorded salience in the 
choice points SITUATION ORIENTATION and PARTICI- 
PANT ORIENTATION. 
Finally, the third option in the SITUATIONAL ORIEN- 
TATION system, 'process orientation' is responsible for 
the neutral LF V0, which provides the most direct lex- 
ical verb for realizing the key term of a situation; e.g., 
Vo ( i.lzuence) = \[to\] influence. 
Tempora l  dependency  
LFs also address the global arrangement ofa process on 
the temporal axes by the definition of its preceding and 
succeeding processes. These considerations are reached 
in the network by a feature selection of {global tempo- 
ral oriented, . . . ,  } from the alternatives of the TEMPO- 
RAL ORIENTATION choice point. These alternatives call 
for the application of the LFs P rox  and Perf ;  exam- 
ples of which from the ECD for English are: ProxFunc0 
(storm) = brew, Perf (storm) = subside. In addition, 
the internal temporal aspects of a process, represented 
by its stages, axe reflected by the corresponding triple 
of "phasal" LFs: Incep  for the beginning, Cont  for 
continuing, and F in  for the termination stage. These 
meanings are reached via the features under the 'stage 
oriented' option in the choice point PROCESS STAGES 
ORIENTATION in the network. 
Resu l ts  and  consequences  
Situations can also he expressed so as to give salience 
to their results. The treatment of this requires a con- 
sideration of the intended result of the situation

tended result (i.e., the ~purpose' of the carrying out 
the process), then the Real~, Labrealo, and Facts 
groups of LFs are applicable; in the opposite case, the 
AntiReal~, AntiLabrealo,  and AntiFacti groups ap- 
ply. Each of these groups provide further the salience 
either of the key term of the situation itself or of the 
various participants of the situation as determined by 
the simultaneous selections of features made under (in 
this sense Reali and AntiReali correspond to Operl, 
Labreal 0 and AntiLabrealff to Laboro, and Fact~ and 
AntiFactl to Funci). For example: Real2 (order) = 
obey, AntiReal2 (order) = def~.

Situations can also be expressed so as to make the 
causality relationships that the situation enters into ex- 
plicit or not; these options are considered by the choice 
point CAUSALITY ORIENTATION, which is responsible 
for application of either the LF Caus or Perm. 
? The Cans function provides an active causation of the 
situation, as in the case of problem; e.g., CansFunc0 
(problem) = pose. 
? Perm presupposes a 'permission', or allowance or ac- 
ceptance, of the occurrence of the situation; e.g., 
PermPunco (problem) = tolerate.

Guiding the Generation Process by 
Lexis 
The concrete generation system in which we are realiz- 
ing organizational structures of lexis in order to sup- 
port the emphasis of various salience aspects of se- 
mantic structures is the PENMAN system \[Mann and 
Matthiessen, 1985\]. The linguistic core of PENMAN i8 
a large systemic-functional grammar of English, the 
NIGEL grammar \[Matthiessen, 1983\]. The semantic in- 
terface of NIGEL is defined by a set of inquiries which 
mediate the flow of information ,between the grammar 
and external sources of information. PENMAN provides 
structure for some of these external sources of informa- 
tion, including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and 
entities, called the Upper Model (UM) \[Bateman et aL, 
1990; Bateman, 1990\]; the UM hierarchy classifies con- 
cepts according to their possibilities for realization in 
natural language and may be used as an interface be- 
tween the organizational structures of Domain Knowl- 
edge (DK) and the grammar's inquiries. PENMAN ac- 
cepts demands for text to be generated in the notation 
of the PENMAN Sentence Plan Language (SPL) \[Kasper, 
1989a\]. SPL specifications are partial semantic repre- 
sentations of what is to be realized through the gram- 
matical resources of NIGEL. More formally, SPL expres- 
sions are lists of terms describing the types of entities 
and the particular features of those entities that are to 
be expressed in English. The features of SPL terms 
are either semantic relations to be expressed, which are 
drawn from the upper model or from domain concepts 
subordinated to the upper model, or direct specifica- 
tions of responses to NIGEL'S inquiries. 4 
To generate any of the sentences (1)-(9) above using 
PENMAN, therefore, we must define appropriate SPL in- 
put. However, as mentioned in the introduction, these 
input specifications do not, at present, capture the gen- 
eralization that these sentences share significant aspects 
of their meaning. To capture this, while still maintain- 
ing complete functional control of the generator, we in- 
troduce a more abstract input specification, from which 
particular SPL specifications are constructed depending 
on additional salience-oriented semantic distinctions. 
These semantic distinctions are specified in terms of the 
hierarchical organization of the meanings of LFs shown 
in the network of Figure 1. This organization provides 
a statement of semantic feature interdependencies that 
represents he perspectives available and the functional 
motivations for choosing one perspective over another. 
Each of the decision points in this network may place 
constraints on the mapping between the abstract in- 
put level and SPL. These decisions themselves need to 
be made by a text planning component - -  the network 
represents the capability of generating variation under

ponents, see the PENMAN documentation \[The Penman 
Project, 1989\]. 
control rather than the control process itself. In this 
sense, lexis as the stratum containing perspective infor- 
mation provides a controlling mechanism for the gener- 
ation process entirely analogously to the grammatical 
network defined by NIGEL. 
Example of perspective-guided 
generation 
We now illustrate the realization of some chosen per- 
spectives in detail. Consider the clauses (1), (4), (6), 
and (7) given above. The SPL input specifications nec- 
essary to generate ach of these clauses are set out in 
Figure 2. 5 As we can see, there is no connection be- 
tween these since the generalization that they refer to 
the same situation is captured neither within the gram- 
mar, nor the upper model. Our new level of abstract in- 
put to the generation process, which corresponds more 
with Mel'~uk's conception of 'abstract situation' intro- 
duced above, provides this connection as follows. Ab- 
stract situations are represented in terms of a general 
type and a set of participants drawn from the lexemes 
defined with respect o the Domain Knowledge; for ex- 
ample, the abstract input for the situation underlying 
sentences (1), (4), (6), and (7) may be set out thus: 6 
SO use 
T $1 we 
T $2 adjective ' lectronic' 
So indication 
T $2 reader 
TS3 \ [So(deep)  dedication\] 
T Ss T $1 dictionaries 
T $2 computers 
In order to generate sentences from this specification, 
we need to construct appropriate SPL expressions. This 
we achieve by following the semantic alternatives made 
in the LF network of Figure 1, applying the constraints 
that it specifies to compose a mapping between the ab- 
stract input and SPL. 
Thus, for example, consider the context of use where 
a text planner has determined, in addition to express- 
ing the situation shown in the abstract input, that 
that situation is to be presented textually as one in 
which the process is introduced neutrally, without re- 
spect for what preceded or succeeded, and with the pro- 
cess and the first participant (we: $1) made relatively 
more salient. This corresponds to the set of LF net-- 
work features {non-causal oriented, non-stage oriented, 
global temporal oriented, current process, introduction 
oriented, process-oriented, 1st participant processual). 
5Note that in this figure, in order to save space, we share 
the vaxables re,  N1, A1, ASl across the distinct SPL spec- 
ifications; this would not normally be done. 
OThe notation T Si is used to indicate that the value 
given is not the value of the LF Si itself, it is rather the 
value of the role that the LF delivers; i.e., $1 (use) is user.

Figure 2: SPL specifications for differing perspectives on a situation 
This set of features governs the selection of the LF V0, 
which is applied to the key-term of the situation, i.e., 
to So of the input form: the lexeme associated with the 
DK concept use. The ECD for the language then sup- 
plies a candidate lexical item - -  in this case, the process 
USe. 
We integrate the information from the ECD by re- 
quiring lexical items to be linked to concepts which are 
subordinated to the PENMAN upper model. It is then 
possible to determine, by inheritance, the particular set 
of upper model/semantic role relations that are appro- 
priate for a process of any type. The concept for use 
is classified as a nondirected-acf io,  in the upper model 
and so the role-set :ac tor ,  :actee  is inherited. The 
fillers of these roles are then selected from the ordered 
set of participants specified in the abstract input under 
$1, $2. The process then recurses for the complex filler 
of $3 - -  filling, in this case, the :purpose upper model 
relation - -  and the SPL given in Figure 2 for sentence 
(1) is constructed. 7 
If the text planning component had determined that 
a different set of presentational LF features were neces- 
sary, then a different LF would be selected for applica- 
tion to the key-term of the abstract input. Thus, with 
the selection of the features {non-causal oriented, non- 
stage oriented, global temporal oriented, current pro- 
cess, result oriented, result intended, participant ori- 
ented, 1st participant oriented}, which expresses the 
7The association of the abstract situational roles S~ and 
the roles drawn from the upper model in fact offers another 
significant source of presentation variability which may also 
be addressed in terms of LFs. We do not discuss this further 
within the confines of the present paper however. 
intended effect of the process use with salience on its 
first participant, he LF Real1 is selected and, here, the 
ECD gives the process illustrate. This term is then, 
again, selected as the main term in the corresponding 
SPL specification and, as before, since it is also linked 
into the upper model, we know that the relevant role 
set is :ac tor ,  :ac tee ,  :moans. The further mapping 
of situational roles Si to available UM-roles then pro- 
vides the necessary fillers for the slots in the SPL. This 
gives the SPL for sentence (6). 
In sentences (4) and (7), the interaction between the 
lexical network and the situation subordinated under 
Ss in the abstract input is shown, s For the situation of 
'indication', then, when the LF features: {non-causal 
oriented, non-stage oriented, global temporal oriented, 
current process, introduction oriented, participant ori- 
ented, 2nd participant oriented} are required, express- 
ing that the situation is introduced with emphasis on its 
internal composition and participants and that the sec- 
ond of those participants i the more salient, then the 
LF Oper2 is selected for application to the filler of T $3 
(i.e., indication). The ECD in this case supplies get. 
Note that here, the LF Oper2 also has consequences for 
the latter mapping between situational roles and upper 
model roles; the key-term itself, So, is now associated 
with the role :actee.  This provides the SPL specifica- 
tion for sentence (4). 
SWork elsewhere (e.g., \[Bateman and Paxis, 1989\]) has 
shown that propositionally embedded components of an in- 
put specification can be linguistically realized under certain 
textual conditions as unembedded, or as dominating, con- 
stituents. This is the case here, although space precludes a 
more thorough discussion.

Finally, with the selection of LF features {non-causal 
oriented, stage oriented, beginning, participant ori- 
ented, 1st participant oriented, global temporal ori- 
ented, current process, introduction oriented}, the LF 
IncepOperl is selected. When this is applied to indica- 
tion, the ECD gives the process create and the SPL for 
sentence (7) is set up accordingly. 
Conclusion 
We have shown how lexical cooccurrence r lations can 
be used to express the salience of particular aspects of 
abstract semantic structures and how their underlying 
meaning and communicative function can be organized 
in order to influence the generation process. A spec- 
ification of perspectival presentatation features as de- 
fined in the network of Figure 1 makes it possible to 
generate rather varied surface realizational forms. We 
can view this network as a candidate for the textual 
organization \[Matthiessen, 1988\] of lexis - -  which com- 
plements the more traditional 'propositional' organiza- 
tion found in lexical discrimination ets (e.g., \[Gold- 
man, 1975\]) and thesauri. The textual/communicative 
functional meanings of LFs we propose, although ar- 
guably inherent in the MTM, have not formerly been 
extracted as an explicit principle of organization. We 
suggest hat this kind of organization may substan- 
tiMly enhance the information collected by MTM re- 
searchers. Finally, although we have restricted our- 
selves in this paper to details that are particularly rel- 
evant for modeling situation perspectives, we are work- 
ing towards a general model of lexis including, e.g., a 
semantically motivated classification of verbs, relations, 
etc. as proposed by, for example, \[Matthiessen, 1988; 
Hasan, 1987\] and pursued in a computational context 
by \[Fawcett and Tucker, 1989\]. For this we also use a 
set of further LFs represented on various levels of ab- 
straction.
