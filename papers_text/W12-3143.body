Abstract 
This paper describes the PROMT submission 
for the WMT12 shared translation task. We 
participated in two language pairs: English-
French and English-Spanish. The translations 
were made using the PROMT DeepHybrid 
engine, which is the first hybrid version of the 
PROMT system. We report on improvements 
over our baseline RBMT output both in terms 
of automatic evaluation metrics and linguistic 
analysis. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper we present the PROMT DeepHy-
brid submission for WMT12 shared translation 
task for two language pairs: English-French and 
English-Spanish. 
A common approach to create hybrid machine 
translation (MT) systems on the basis of rule-based 
machine translation (RBMT) systems is to build a 
statistical phrase-based post-editing (SPE) system 
using state-of-the-art SMT technologies (see Si-
mard et al. 2007). An SPE system views the output 
of the RBMT system as the source language, and 
reference human translations as the target lan-
guage. SPE systems are used to correct typical 
mistakes of the RBMT output and to adapt RBMT 
systems to specific domains. (Dugast et al. 2007) 
report on good results both in terms of automatic 
evaluation metrics and human evaluation for the 
SPE systems based on PORTAGE (Sadat et al. 
2005) and Moses (Koehn et al. 2007). However, an 
SMT model in fact makes translation output less 
predictable in comparison with RBMT output. We 
propose a different approach to hybrid MT tech-
nology. We developed and incorporated the SPE 
component into our translation system (the statisti-
cal post-editing data is controlled by the PROMT 
hybrid translation engine). Besides, we have an 
internal language model (LM) component that 
scores the generated translation candidates. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: in section 2 we provide the detailed descrip-
tion of our hybrid MT technology. In section 3 we 
evaluate the performance of the technology on two 
language pairs: English-French and English-
Spanish. We gain improvements over the baseline 
RBMT system in terms of BLEU score on test sets. 
We also introduce the results of linguistic evalua-
tion performed by our experts. Section 4 summa-
rizes the key findings and outlines open issues for 
future work. 
2 System description 
The PROMT DeepHybrid system is based on 
our RBMT engine. The baseline system has been 
augmented with several modules for hybrid train-
ing and translation. The training technology is fully 
automated, but each step can be fulfilled and tuned 
separately. 
2.1 Rule-based component 
PROMT covers 51 language pairs for 13 differ-
ent source languages. Our system is traditionally 
classified as a ?rule-based? system. PROMT uses 
morphosyntactic analyzers to analyze the source 
sentence and transfer rules to translate the sentence 
345
into the target language. The crucial component of 
our system is the PROMT bilingual dictionaries 
which contain up to 250K entries for each lan-
guage pair. Each entry is supplied with various 
linguistic (lexical and grammatical, morphological, 
semantic) features. Besides the ?baseline? diction-
aries the PROMT system has a large number of 
domain-specific dictionaries. 
2.2 Parallel corpus processing 
We have a specific component for processing 
parallel corpora before training the hybrid system. 
This component can process data in plain text and 
XML formats. We also perform substantial data 
filtering. All punctuation and special symbols 
(ligatures etc.) are normalized. The length of the 
words in a sentence and the length of sentences are 
taken into account (sentences having length above 
a set threshold are discarded). All duplicated sen-
tences are discarded as well. On top of that, we 
remove parallel segments with different number of 
sentences because such segments corrupt phrase 
alignment. Strings containing few alphabetic sym-
bols and untranslated sentences are filtered out 
from the parallel corpus. 
2.3 Automated dictionary extraction  
 
 
 
The extraction technology is shown in figure 1. 
The whole process can be subdivided into two 
separate tasks: 1) statistical alignment of a parallel 
corpus 2) extraction of syntactic phrases from the 
source and target sides of the parallel corpus. We 
then combine the results of these tasks to extract 
bilingual terminology. We use GIZA++ to perform 
the word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003). Then we 
use the common heuristics to extract parallel 
phrase pairs (Koehn et al. 2007). We use the 
PROMT parsers to extract grammatically correct 
phrases from source and target sides of the parallel 
corpora. PROMT parsers are rule-based multi-level 
morphosyntactic analyzers. Parsers extract noun 
phrases, verb phrases and adverbial phrases. The 
extraction is done as follows: each sentence of the 
corpus is parsed, a parse tree is created, the ex-
tracted syntactic phrases are stored in memory; 
after the whole corpus is processed, all extracted 
phrases are lemmatized and presented in a list. 
Each phrase is supplied with a set of linguistic fea-
tures (part of speech, lemma, lemma frequency 
etc.). The next step is building a bilingual glossary 
using two sets of syntactic phrases extracted from 
the source and the target sides of the parallel cor-
pus on the one hand and a statistically aligned set 
of phrase pairs on the other hand. We do not add 
geographic names, proper names and named enti-
ties (dates etc.) to the glossary because they are 
well processed by the RBMT engine. 
2.4 Statistical phrase-based post-editing  
The technology of obtaining data for statistical 
post-editing is standard. We translate the source 
corpus using the RBMT engine. Then we align the 
MT corpus and the target corpus using GIZA++ 
and extract parallel phrase pairs to obtain a phrase-
table. Then the phrase-table is filtered. The phrase 
length and translation probability are taken into 
account. Only pairs having length of the source 
phrase from three to seven words are selected. This 
specific length range was chosen according to the 
detailed analysis of the resulting hybrid MT quality 
performed by our linguists. The selected phrase 
pairs are stored in the special SPE component of 
the hybrid engine and are used to apply post-
editing to the translation candidates generated by 
the RBMT engine during the translation process. 
 
2.5 Language model component  
The language model (LM) component is used to 
score the translation candidates generated by the

engine. The RBMT engine can generate several 
translation candidates depending on the number of 
homonymic words and phrases and transfer rules 
variants. Statistical phrase-based post-editing is 
applied separately to each of the generated candi-
dates. All of the candidates (with and without post-
edition) are scored by the LM component and the 
candidate with the lowest perplexity one is se-
lected. 
3 Experimental setting  
We used the total Europarliament (EP) and 
NewsCommentary (NC) corpora provided by the 
organizers for the English-Spanish submission. We  
 
translated both (EP and NC) corpora using the 
RBMT engine and then built a single phrase-table 
for both corpora. Then we filtered the phrase-table 
according to the source phrase length and transla-

tion probabilities as described in section 2.4. Only 
10% of the initial phrase-table were used as statis-
tical post-editing data. The target 5-gram language 
model was trained on all provided monolingual 
data except the LDC corpora. We did not extract 
the dictionary for this language pair. 
As for the English-French submission, we per-
formed bilingual training data selection from EP 
and United Nations (UN) corpora. We trained the 
source and target language models on English and 
French monolingual News corpora respectively. 
These models were used to score each sentence 
pair of EP and UN corpora. Then we selected sen-
tence pairs from EP and UN corpora via the geo-
metric mean of perplexities of the source and target 
sentences. About 85% of EP (35M words of the 
source corpus) and 35% of UN (68M words of the 
source corpus) were selected. Then we translated 
the selected EP and UN subcorpora and the whole 
NC corpus with the RBMT engine. A single 
phrase-table was built for all three corpora. The 
phrase-table was fitered with the same parameters 
as for the English-Spanish submission. Approxi-
mately 8% of the initial phrase-table were used as 
statistical post-editing data. The target 5-gram lan-
guage model was trained on all provided monolin-
gual data except the LDC corpora. 
We also performed automated dictionary extrac-
tion for the English-French pair. Examples of the 
extracted entries can be found in Table 1. The de-
tails about the extracted dictionary can be found in  
 
 
Table 2. We only extracted verbs, nouns and noun 
phrases for this shared task. The translations for 
extracted verbs and nouns are automatically added 
into the existing PROMT dictionary entries using 
our multifunctional dictionary component. Thus 
we increase the number of lexical variants and 
generated translation candidates. The extracted 
noun phrases are added to the PROMT dictionary 
as new entries. We only extract ?informative? en-
tries, i.e. the noun phrases which are absent in the 
baseline PROMT dictionary or have an incorrect or 
infrequent translation. It should also be mentioned 
that the initial size of the noun phrases glossary 
was over 25K entries, but we decided to raise the 
source phrase frequency threshold a bit. Our hy-
pothesis was that non-frequent phrases from out-
of-domain corpora (EP and UN) would not fit for 
translation of news texts. 20K entries are selected.

Our linguists compared 100 random RBMT and 
DeepHybrid (with extracted dictionary and statisti-
cal post-editing) translations for both language 
pairs in terms of improvements and degradations. 
The results presented in Table 5 show that the 
DeepHybrid engine outperforms the RBMT engine 
according to human evaluation. Most of the degra-
dations are minor grammatical issues (wrong num-
ber, disagreement etc.). 
5 Conclusions and future work 
We presented the PROMT DeepHybrid system 
submissions for WMT12 shared translation task. 
We showed improvements both in terms of BLEU 
scores and human evaluation compared to baseline 
PROMT RBMT engine. 
We extracted a dictionary from a corpus of over 
200M words. The size of the dictionary (~20K en-
tries) is relatively small due to our robust linguistic 
and statistical data filtering. However, such filter-
ing minimizes the number of possible mistransla-
tions and guarantees that the extracted entries are 
universal. We are planning to add the extracted 
data to our baseline English-French dictionary after 
manual check and perform the same experiments 
for other language pairs. 
As for statistical post-editing, the impact on the 
RBMT output is quite moderate (less than 50%). 
This is also due to our approach which includes 
filtering out infrequent phrase pairs from statistical 
post-editing data. We assume that the RBMT out-
put is already good enough and therefore does not 
require much statistical post-editing to be applied. 
It should be mentioned that for the present we only 
use perplexity to score translation candidates. Sev-
eral other features will be implemented in the next 
version of the hybrid engine. To avoid grammatical 
inconsistency in the hybrid MT output, we are 
planning to apply linguistic filters to statistical 
post-editing data.
