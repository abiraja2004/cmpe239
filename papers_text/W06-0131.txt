Abstract 
In this paper, a language tagging tem-
plate named POC-NLW (position of a 
character within an n-length word) is pre-
sented. Based on this template, a two-
stage statistical model for Chinese word 
segmentation is constructed. In this 
method, the basic word segmentation is 
based on n-gram language model, and a 
Hidden Markov tagger based on the 
POC-NLW template is used to imple-
ment the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word 
identification. The system participated in 
the MSRA_Close and UPUC_Close 
word segmentation tracks at SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2006. Results returned by this 
bakeoff are reported here. 
1 Introduction 
In Chinese word segmentation, there are two 
problems still remain, one is the resolution of 
ambiguity, and the other is the identification of 
so-called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or unknown 
words. In order to resolve these two problems, a 
two-stage statistical word segmentation strategy 
is adopted in our system. The first stage is op-
tional, and the whole segmentation can be ac-
complished in the second stage. In the first stage, 
the n-gram language model is employed to im-
plement basic word segmentation including dis-
ambiguation. In the second stage, a language 
tagging template named POC-NLW (position of 
a character within an n-length word) is intro-
duced to accomplish unknown word identifica-
tion as template-based character tagging. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. In section 2 and section 3, a briefly de-
scription of the main methods adopted in our 
system is given. Results of our system at this 
bakeoff are reported in section 4. At last, conclu-
sions are derived in section 5. 
2 The Basic Word Segmentation Stage 
In the first stage, the basic word segmentation is 
accomplished. The key issue in this stage is the 
ambiguity problem, which is mainly caused by 
the fact that a Chinese character can occur in dif-
ferent word internal positions in different words 
(Xue, 2003). A lot of machine learning tech-
niques have been applied to resolve this problem, 
the n-gram language model is one of the most 
popular ones among them (Fu and Luke, 2003; 
Li et al, 2005). As such, we also employed n-
gram model in this stage.  
When a sentence is inputted, it is first seg-
mented into a sequence of individual characters 
(e.g. ASCII strings, basic Chinese characters, 
punitions, numerals and so on), marked as C1,n. 
According to the system?s dictionary, several 
word sequences W1,m will be constructed as can-
didates. The function of the n-gram model is to 
find out the best word sequence W* corresponds 
to C1,n, which has the maximum integrated prob-
ability, i.e.,

The Maximum Likelihood method was used to 
estimate the word n-gram probabilities used in 
our model, and the linear interpolation method 
(Jelinek and Mercer, 1980) was applied to 
smooth these estimated probabilities. 
3 The OOV Word Identification Stage 
The n-gram method is based on the exiting grams 
in the model, so it is good at judging the connect-
ing relationship among known words, but does 
not have the ability to deal with unknown words 
in substance. Therefore, another OOV word 
identification model is required.  
OOV words are regarded as words that do not 
exist in a system?s machine-readable dictionary, 
and a more detailed definition can be found in 
(Wu and Jiang, 2000). In general, Chinese word 
can be created through compounding or abbrevi-
ating of most of existing characters and words. 
Thus, the key to solve the OOV word identifica-
tion lies on whether the new word creation 
mechanisms in Chinese language can be ex-
tracted. Therefore, a POC-NLW language tag-
ging template is introduced to explore such in-
formation on the character-level within words. 
3.1 The POC-NLW Template 
Many character-level based works have been 
done for the Chinese word segmentation, includ-
ing the LMR tagging methods (Xue, 2003; Na-
kagawa. 2004), the IWP mechanism (Wu and 
Jiang, 2000). Based on these previous works, this 
POC-NLW template was derived. Assume that 
the length of a word is the number of component 
characters in it, the template is consist of two 
component: Lmax and a Wl-Pn tag set. Lmax to de-
note the maximum length of a word expressed by 
the template; a Wl-Pn tag denotes that this tag is 
assigned to a character at the n-th position within 
a l-length word, . Apparently, the 
size of this tag set is  
ln ,,2,1 L=
2/)1( maxmax LL ?+
For example, the Chinese word ??? ? is 
tagged as: 
 ? W2P1, ? W2P2 
and ????? is tagged as: 
 ? W3P1, ? W3P2, ? W3P3 
In the example, two words are tagged by the 
template respectively, and the Chinese character 
??? has been assigned two different tags.  
In a sense, the Chinese word creation mecha-
nisms could be extracted through statistics of the 
tags for each character on a certain large corpus.  
On the other hand, while a character sequence 
in a sentence is tagged by this template, the word 
boundaries are obvious. Meanwhile, the word 
segmentation is implemented.  
In addition, in this template, known words and 
unknown words are both regarded as sequences 
of individual characters. Thus, the basic word 
segmentation process, the disambiguation proc-
ess and the OOV word identification process can 
be accomplished in a unified process. Thereby, 
this model can also be used alone to implement 
the word segmentation task. This characteristic 
will make the word segmentation system much 
more efficient. 
3.2 The HMM Tagger 
Form the description of POC-NLW template, it 
can be found that the word segmentation could 
be implemented as POC-NLW tagging, which is 
similar to the so-called part-of-speech (POS) 
tagging problem. In POS tagging, Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) was applied as one of the 
most significant methods, as described in detail 
in (Brants, 2000). The HMM method can achieve 
high accuracy in tagging with low processing 
costs, so it was adopted in our model. 
According to the definition of POC-NLW 
template, the state set of HMM corresponds to 
the Wl-Pn tag set, and the symbol set is com-
posed of all characters. However, the initial state 
probability matrix and the state transition prob-
ability matrix are not composed of all of the tags 
in the state set. To express more clearly, we de-
fine two subset of the state set: 
? Begin Tag Set (BTS): this set is con-
sisted of tag which can occur in the beg-
ging position in a word. Apparently, these 
tags must have the Wl-P1 form.  
? End Tag Set (ETS): correspond to BTS, 
tags in this set should occur in the end po-
sition, and their form should be like Wl-Pl. 
Apparently, the size of BTS is Lmax as well as 
of ETS. Thus, the initial state probability matrix 
corresponds to BTS instead of the whole state set. 
On the other hand, because of the word internal 
continuity, if the current tag Wl-Pn is not in ETS, 
than the next tag must be Wl-P(n+1). In other 
words, the case in which the transition probabil-
ity is need is that when the current tag is in ETS 
and the next tag belongs to BTS. So, the state 
transition matrix in our model corresponds to 
BTSETS ? . 
178
The probabilities used in HMM were defined 
similarly to those in POS tagging, and were es-
timated using the Maximum Likelihood method 
from the training corpus. 
In the two-stage strategy, the output word se-
quence of the first stage is transferred into the 
second stage. The items in the sequence, includ-
ing individual characters and words, which do 
not have a bigram or trigram relationship with 
the surrounding items, are picked out with its 
surrounding items to compose several sequences 
of items. These item sequences are processed by 
the HMM tagger to form new item sequences. At 
last, these processed items sequences are com-
bined into the whole word sequence as the final 
output. 
4 Results and Analysis 
4.1 System 
The system submitted at this bakeoff was a two-
stage one, as describe at beginning of this paper. 
The model used in the first stage was trigram, 
and the Lmax of the template used in the second 
stage was set to 7. 
In addition to the tags defined in the template 
before, a special tag is introduced into our Wl-Pn 
tag set to indicate all those characters that occur 
after the Lmax-th position in an extremely long 
(longer than Lmax) word., formulized as WLmax-
P(Lmax+1). And then, there are 28 basic tags 
(from W1-P1 to W7-P7) and the special one W7-
P8.  
For instance, using the special tag, the word 
???????????? (form the MSRA 
Corpus ) is tagged as: 
? W7-P1  ? W7-P2  ? W7-P3  ? W7-P4 
? W7-P5  ? W7-P6  ? W7-P7  ? W7-P8 
? W7-P8  ? W7-P8 
4.2 Results at SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006 
Our system participated in the MSRA_Close and 
UPUC_Close track at the SIGHAN Bakeoff 
2006. The test results are as showed in Table 1.

F-measure 0.951 0.918

Precision 0.947 0.904

OOV Recall 0.493 0.546 
OOV Precision 0.569 0.757 
Table 1. Results at SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006 
 
The performances of our system on the two 
corpuses can rank in the half-top group among 
the participated systems.  
We notice that the accuracies on known word 
segmentation are relatively better than on OOV 
words segmentation. This appears somewhat un-
expected. In the close experiments we had done 
on the PKU and MSR corpuses of SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2005, the relative performance of OOV 
Recall was much more outstanding than of the F-
measure. 
We think this is due to the inappropriate pa-
rameters used in n-gram model, which over-
guarantees the performance of basic word seg-
mentation. It can be seen on the IV Recall (high-
est in UPUC_Close track). For only the best out-
put sequence of the n-gram model is transferred 
to the HMM tagger, some potential unknown 
words may be miss-split in the early stage. Thus, 
the OOV Recall is not very good, and this also 
affects the overall performance. 
On the other hand, the performances of OOV 
identification on UPUC are much better than on 
MSRA, while the performances of overall seg-
mentation accuracy on UPUC are worse than on 
MSRA. This phenomenon also happened in our 
experiments on the Bakeoff 2005 corpuses of 
PKU and MSR. In the PKU test data, the rate of 
OOV words according is 0.058 while in MSR is 
0.026. Thus, it can be conclude that the more 
unknown words occur, the more significant abil-
ity of OOV words identification appears.  
In addition, the relative performance of OOV 
Precision are much better. This demonstrates that 
the OOV identification ability of our system is 
appreciable. In other words, the POC-NLW tag-
ging method introduced is effective to some ex-
tent. 
5 CONCLUSION AND FURTHER 
WORK 
In this paper, a POC-NLW template is presented 
for word segmentation, which aims at exploring 
the word creation mechanisms in Chinese lan-
guage by utilizing the character-level informa-
tion to. A two-stage strategy was applied in our 
system to combine the n-gram model based word 
segmentation and OOV word identification im-
plemented by a HMM tagger. Test results show 
that the method achieved high performance on 
word segmentation, especially on unknown 
words identification. Therefore, the method is a 
practical one that can be implemented as an inte-
179
gral component in actual Chinese NLP applica-
tions.  
From the results, it can safely conclude that 
method introduced here does find some charac-
ter-level information, and the information could 
effectively conduct the word segmentation and 
unknown words identification. For this is the first 
time we participate in this bakeoff, and the work 
has been done as a integral part of another sys-
tem during the past two months, the implementa-
tion of the segmentation system we submitted is 
coarse. A lot of improvements, on either theo-
retical methods or implementation techniques, 
are required in our future work, including the 
smoothing techniques in the n-gram model and 
the HMM model, the refine of the features ex-
traction method and the POC-NLW template it-
self, the more harmonious integration strategy 
and so on.
