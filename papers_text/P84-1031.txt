ABSTRACT 
Th is  paper  descr ibes  some recent  deve lopments  in  
language process ing  invo lv ing  computat iona l  
mode ls  which more c lose ly  resemble  the  bra in  in  
both  s t ruc ture  and funct ion .  These  mode ls  employ 
a la rge  number  o f  in te rconnected  para l le l  
computat iona l  units which  communicate  via 
weighted levels of excitation and inhibition. A 
specific model is described which uses this 
approach to process some fragments of connected 
discourse. 
I CONNECTIONIST MODELS 
The human brain consists of about i00,000 
mill ion neuronal units with between a lO00 and 
I0,000 connections each. The two main classes of 
cells in the cortex are the striate and pyramidal 
cells. The pyramidal cells are generally larse 
and heavily arborized. They are the main output 
cells of a region of cortex, and they mediate 
connections between one region and the next. The 
strlate cells are smaller, and act more locally. 
The neural circuitry of the cortex is, apart from 
some minor variations, remarkably consistent. Its 
dominant characteristics are Its parallelism, its 
large number processing units, and the extensive 
in terconnect ion  of these units. This is a 
fundamenta l ly  d i f ferent  s t ructure from the 
traditional von Neumann model. Those in favor of 
adopting a connectionist approach to modelling 
human cognition argue that the structure of the 
human nervous system is so different from the 
structure impl ic i t  in current in format ion-  
processing models that the standard approach 
cannot ultimately be successful. They argue that 
even at an abstract level, removed from immediate 
neural considerations, the fundamental structure 
of the human nervous system has a pervasive 
effect. 
Counect lou ls t  models form a class of 
spreading activation or active semantic network 
model. Each primitive computing unit in the 
network can be thought of as a stylized neuron. 
Its output is a function of a vector of inputs 
from neighbourlng units and a current level of 
excitation. The inputs can be both excitatory 
and inhibtory. The output  of each unit has a 
rest r ic ted range (in the case of the model  
described here, it can have a value between i and 
lO). Associated with each unit are a number of 
computational functions. At each input site 
there are /unctions which determine how the 
i nputs  a re  to  be  summar ized .  A potent ia l  
funct ion  determines  the  re la t ionsh ip  between the  
summar ized  s i te  inputs  and the  un i t ' s  overa l l  
potent ia l .  F ina l ly ,  au  output  funct ion  
determines  the  re la t ionsh ip  between a un i t ' s  
potent ia l  and the  va lue  that  i t  t ransmi ts  to i t s  
nelghhours. 
There  are  a number of  const ra in ts  inhererent  
in  a neura l ly  based  mode l .  One o f  the  most  
significant is that the coinage of the brain is 
frequency of firing. This means that the inputs 
and outputs cannot carry more than a few bits of 
information. There are not enough bits in firing 
f requency to a l low symbol  pass ing between 
individual units. This is perhaps the single 
biggest difference between thls approach and and 
that of standard informatlon-processing models. 
Another important constraint is that decisions in 
the network are completely distributed, each unit 
computes its output solely on the basis of its 
inputs; it cannot "look around" to see what 
others are doing, and no central controller gives 
it instructions. 
A number of l anguage  re la ted  app l i ca t ions  
have  been deve loped  us ing  th i s  type  o f  approach .  
The most  notab le  o f  these  i s  the  mode l  o f  
McC le l land  and  Rumelhar t  (1981) .  They  
demonst ra ted  that  a model  based  on connect ion is t  
p r inc ip les  cou ld  reproduce  many of the  
character i s tcs  of  the  so -ca l led  word -super io r i ty  
e f fec t .  Th is  i s  an  e f fec t  in  wh ich  le t te rs  in  
b r ie f ly  p resented  words and pseudo-words  a re  more 
eas i l y  ident i f i ab le  than  le t te rs  in  non-words .  
At a h igher  leve l  in  the  process ing  h ie rarchy ,  
connect ion is t  schemes  have  been proposed  fo r  
mode l l ing  wOr~.sense  d i sambiguat ion  (Cot t re l l  & 
Smal l ,  1983) ,  and fo r  sentence  pars ing  in  genera l  
(Small, Cottrell, & Shastrl, 1982).

The model described in this paper is 
basically an extension of the work of Cottrell 
and Small (1983), and of Small (1982). It 
extends their sentence-centred model to deal with 
connected text, or discourse, and specifically 
with anaphorlc resolution in discourse. The 
model is not proposed as definitive in any way. 
It merely sets out to illustrate the properties 
of connectlonlst models, and to show how such 
models might be extended beyond simple word 
recognition applications. 
IT ANAPHORA 
The term anaphor  der ives  from the Greek fo r  
"po in t ing  back" .  What i s  po in ted  to  i s  o f ten  
re fer red  to as the antecedent  of  the anaphor .  
However, the precise definition of an antecedent 
is problematic. Superflclally, it might be 
thought of as a preceding text element. However, 
as Sidner (1983) pointed out words do not refer 
to other words; people use words to refer to 
objects, and anaphora are used to refer to 
objects which have already been mentioned in a 
discourse. Sidner also maintains that the 
concept of co-reference is inadequate to explain 
the relationship between anaphor and antecedent. 
Co-reference means that anaphor and antecedent 
both refer to the same object. This explanation 
suffices for a sentence llke: 
( i )  I th ink  green  app les  a re  best  and they 
make the best  cook ing app les  too .  
where both the~ and green app les  re fer  to the 
same ob jec t .  However, i t  i s  inadequate  when 
dea l ing  w i th  the fo l low ing  d iscourse :  
(2) My neighbour has an Irish Wolfhound. 
The~ are really huge, but friendly dogs. 
In this case they refers to the class of Irish 
Wolfhounds, but the antecedent phrase refers to a 
member of that set. Therefore, the anaphor and 
antecedent cannot be said to co-refer. Sidner 
introduces the concept of specification and 
co-speclflcetlon to get around this problem. 
Tnstead of referring to objects in the real 
world, the anaphor and its antecedent specify a 
cognitive element in the hearerls mind. Even 
though the same element is not co-speclfled one 
specification may be used generate the other. 
This is not possible with co-reference because, 
as Sidner puts it: 
Co-speclflcatlon, unlike co-reference, 
a l lows one to  const ruc t  abst ract  
representations and define relationships 
between them which can be studied in a 
computational framework. With coreference, 
no such use is posslble, since the object 
referred to exists in the world and is not 
ava i lab le  for examinat ion  by the 
computational process. (Sidner, 1983; p. 
269). 
S idner  proposes  two major  sources  of  const ra in t  
on what can become the co-speclflcatlon of an 
anaphorlc reference. One is the shared knowledge 
of speaker and hearer, and the other is the 
concept of focus. At any given time the focus of 
a discourse is that discourse element which is 
currently being elaborated upon, and on which the 
speakers have centered their attention. This 
concept of focus will be Implemented in the model 
to be described, though differently from the way 
Sidner (1983) has envisaged it. In her model 
possible focuses are examined serlally, and a 
decision is not made until a sentence has been 
completely analyzed. In the model proposed here, 
the focus is arrived at on-llne, and the process 
used is a parallel one. 
Ill THE SIMULATOR 
The model descr ibed  here  was const ructed  
us ing  an in teract ive  eonnect ion is t  s imu la tor  
wr i t ten  in  Sa l fo rd  LISP and based on the des ign  
fo r  the Un ivers i ty  of  Rochester ' s  ISCON s imulator  
(Smal l ,  Shast r i ,  Brucks ,  Kaufman, Cot t re l l ,  & 
Addanki,  1983).  The s imulator  a l lows  the user  to 
des ign  d i f fe rent  types  of  un i t s .  These can have 
any number  of  input  s i tes ,  each  w i th  an 
associated site function. Units also have an 
associated potential and output function. As 
well as unit types, ISCON allows the user to 
design different types of weighted llnk. A 
network is constructed by generating units of 
various types and connecting them up. Processln E 
is initiated by activating designated input 
units. The simulator is implemented on a Prime 
550. A network of about 50 units and 300 links 
takes  approx imate ly  30 CPU seconds per  i te ra t ion .  
As the number of  un i t s  inc reases  the s imula tor  
takes  exponent ia l l y  longer ,  mak ing  i t  very  
unwie ldy  fo r  networks  of  more than  100 un i ts .  One 
so lu t ion  to the speed problem i s  to compi le  the  
networks  so that  they can be executed  fas ter .  A 
more rad ica l  so lu t ion ,  and one which we are  
cur rent ly  work ing on, i s  to deve lop a progra - - , ing  
language which has as i t s  bas ic  un i t  a network .  
Th is  language would invo lve  a batch  sys tem rather  
than  an in teract ive  one.  There would,  there fore ,  
be a t rade-o f f  between the  ease  of  use of  an 
in teract ive  system and the  speed and power of a 
batch  approach .  A l though ISCON i s  an exce l lent  
medium for  the const ruct ion  of  networks ,  i t  i s  
inadequate  fo r  any  fo rm o f  soph is t i ca ted  
execut ion  of networks .  The proposed Network 
Programming Language (NPL) would permi t  the 
de f in i t ion  and const ruct ion  of  networks  in  much 
the same way as ISCON. However, w i th  N-PL i t  w i l l  
a l so  be poss ib le  to se lec t ive ly  ac t ivate  sect ions  
of  a par t i cu la r  network ,  to c reate  new networks  
by combining separate  sub-networks ,  to ca lcu la te  
summary ind ices  of  any network ,  and to  use  these  
ind ices  in  gu id ing  the f low of  cont ro l  in  the  
145 
program. NPL will have a number of modern flow 
of control facilities (for example, FOR and WHILE 
loops). Unfortunately, thls language is still at 
the design stage and is not available for use. 
IV THE MODEL 
The model consists of five main components 
which interact in the manner illustrated in 
Figure i. The llnes ending in filled circles 
indicate inhibitory connections, the ordinary 
lines, excitatory ones. Each component consists 
of sets of neuron-llke units which can either 
excite or inhibit neighbouring nodes, and nodes 
in connected components. A successful parsing of 
a sentence is deemed to have taken place if~ 
during the processing of the discourse, the focus 
is accurately followed, and if at its end there 
is a stable coalition of only those units central 
to the discourse. A set of units is deemed a 
stable coalition if their level of activity is 
above threshold and non-decreasing.

Figure I. The main components of the model. 
A. Lexical Level 
There is one unit at the lexical level for 
every word in the model's lexicon. Most of the 
units are connected to the word sense level by 
unidirectional links, and after activation they 
decay rapidly. Units which do not have a word 
sense representation, such as function words and 
pronouns, are connected by unidirectional llnk to 
the case and schema levels. A lexical unit is 
connected to all the possible senses of the word. 
These connections are weighted according to the 
frequency of occurence of the senses. To 
s imulate hear ing or reading a sentence the 
lexlcal units are activated one after another 
from left to right, in the order they occur in 
the  sentence. 
B. Word Sense Level 
The units at this level represent the 
"meaning" of the morphemes in the sentence. 
Ambiguous words are connected to all their 
posslble meaning units, which are connected to 
each other by inhibitory links. As Cottrell and 
Small  (1983) have shown, this ar rangement  
provides an accuraate model of the processes 
invo lved  in word  sense  d l samblguat lon .  
Grammat ica l  morphemes,  funct ion words, and 
pronouns do not have explicit representations at 
this level, rather they connect directly to the 
case and schema levels. 
C. Focus Level 
The units at this level represent possible 
focuses of the discourse in the sense that Sidner 
(1983) intends. The focus with the strongest 
activation inhibits competelng focuses. At any 
one time there is a single dominant focus, though 
it may shift as the discourse progresses. A 
shift in focus occurs when evidence for the new 
focus pushes its level of activation above that 
of the old one. In keeping with Sidner's (1983) 
position there are two types of focus used in 
this model, an actor focus and a discourse focus. 
The actor focus represents the animate object in 
the agent case in the most recent sentence. The 
discourse focus is, as its name suggests, the 
central theme of the discourse. The actor focus 
and discourse focus can be one and the same. 
D. Case Leve l  
This modal employs what Cottrell and Small 
(1982) call an "exploded case" representation. 
Instead of general cases such as Agent, Object, 
Patient, and so on, more specific case categories 
are used. For instance, the sentence John kicked 
the ball would activate the specific cases of 
Kick-agent and Kick-object. The units at this 
level only fire when there is evidence from the 
predicate and at least one filler. Their output 
then goes to the appropriate units at the focus 
level. In the example above, the predicate for 
Kick-~gent is kick, and its filler is John. The 
unit Kick-agent then activates the actor focus 
unit for John. 
E. Schema Level 
Th is  model employs a partial implementation 
of Small's (1982) proposal for an exploded system 
of schemas. The schema level consists of a 
hierarchy of ever more abstract schemas. At the 
bottom of the hierarchy there are schemas which 
are so specl fc  that the number of poss ib le  
opt ions for f i l l lng their slots is h ighly 
146 
constrained, and the activation of each schema 
serves, in turn, to activate all its slot 
fillers. Levels further up in the hierarchy 
contain more general schema details, and the 
connections between slots and their potential 
fillers are less strong. 
V THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE 
At its current stage of development the 
model can handle discourse involving pronoun 
anaphora in which the discourse focus is made to 
shift. It can resolve the type of reference 
involved in the following two discourse examples 
(based on examples by Sidner, 1983; p. 276): 
DI-I: I've arranged a meeting with Mick and 
Peter. 
2: It should be in the afternoon. 
3: We can meet in my office. 
4: Invite Pat to come too. 
D2-1: I've arranged a meeting with Mick, Peter, 
and Pat. 
2: It should be in the afternoon. 
3: We can meet in my office. 
4: It's kind of small, 
5: but we'll only need it for an hour. 
In discourse DI, the focus throughout is the 
meeting mentioned in DI-I. The it in DI-2 can be 
seen to co-speclfy the focus. In order to 
determine this a human llstner must use their 
knowledge that meetings have times, among other 
things. Although no mention is made of the 
meeting in DI-3 to DI-4 human l lstners can 
interpret the sentences as being consistent with 
a meetlng focus. In the discourse D2 the initial 
focus is the meeting, but at D2-4 the focus has 
clearly shifted to my office~ and remains there 
until the end of the discourse. 
The network which handles this discourse 
does not parse it in its entirety. The aim is not 
for completeness, but to illustrate the operation 
of the schema level of the model, and to show how 
it aids in determining the focus of the 
discourse. Initlally, in analyzlng D1 the word 
meetin~ activates the schema WORK PLACE MEETING. 
This schema gets activated, rather--than~ny other 
meeting schema, because the overall context of 
the discourse is that of an office memo. Below, 
is a representation of the schema. On the left 
are its component slots, and on the right are all 
the possible fillers for these slots. 
WORK PLACE MEETING schema 
WPM location: library 
tom office 
my~f f l ce  
WPM time: morning 
afternoon 
WPM_partlclpants: tom 
vincent 
patricla 
mick 
peter  
me 
When th i s  schema i s  ac t ivated  the  s lo ts  
become active, and generate a low level of 
subthreshold activity in their potential fillers. 
When one or more fillers become active, as they 
do when the words Hick and Peter are encountered 
at the end of DI-I, the slot forms a feedback 
loop with the fillers which lasts until the 
activity of the sense representation of meetln~ 
declines below a threshold. A slot can only be 
active if the word activating the schema is 
active, which in this case is meetin$. When a 
number of fillers can fill a slot, as is the case 
with the WPM part ic ipant  slot, a form of 
regulated sub-~etwork is used. On the other 
hand, when there can only be one filler for a 
slot, as with the WPM location slot, a winner- 
take-all network is u~ed (both these types of 
sub-network are described in Feldman and Ballard, 
1982). 
Associated with each unit at the sense level 
is a focus unit. A focus unit is connected to 
its corresponding sense unit by a bidirectional 
excitatory link, and to other focus units by 
inhibitory links. As mentioned above, there are 
two separate  networks  of focus  un i ts ,  
corresponding to actor focuses and discourse 
focuses, respectively. Actors are animate objects 
which can serve as agents for verbs. An actor 
focus unit can only become active if its 
associated sense level unit is a filler for an 
agent case slot. The discourse focus and actor 
focus can be, but need not be, one and the same. 
The distinction between the two types of focus is 
in llne with a similar distinction made by Sidner 
(1983). The structure of the focus level network 
ensures that there can only be one discourse 
focus and one actor focus at a given time. In 
discourses D1 and D2 the actor focus throughout 
is the speaker. 
At  the  end  o f  the  sentence  D I -1  the  
WORK PLACE MEETING schema is in a stable 
coa l~ ion  w~th the sense units representing Hick 
and Peter. The focus units active at  this stage 
are those represent ing the speaker of the 
discourse (the actor focus), and the meeting (the 
discourse focus). When the sentence D1-2 is 
147 
encountered the system must determine the 
co-speclflcatlon of it. The lexlcal unit tt  is 
connected to all focus units of inanimate 
objects. It serves to boost the potential of all 
the focus units active at the time. At this 
stage, if there are a number of competitors for 
co-speclficatlon, a number of focus units will be 
activated. However, by the end of the sentence, 
if the discourse is coherent, one or other of the 
focuses should have received suff ic ient 
activation to suppress the activation of its 
competitors. In the case of DI there is no 
competitor for the focus, so the it serves to 
further activate the meeting focus, and does so 
right from the beginning of the sentence. 
The sentence DI-3 serves to fill the 
WPM location slot. The stable coalition is then 
enl~rged to include the sense unit my office. 
The activation of my office activates a schema, 
which might look llke this: 
MY OFFICE schema 
MO location: Prefab 1 
MO size: small 
MO windows: two 
It is not strictly correct to call the above 
structure a schema. Being so specific, there are 
only single fillers for any of its slots. It is 
really a representation of the properties of a 
specif ic office, rather than predict ions 
concerning offices in general. However, in the 
context of this type of model, with the emphasis 
on highly specif ic rather than general 
structures, the differences between the two 
schemas presented above is not a clearcut one. 
When my office is activated, its focus unit 
also receives some activation. This is not 
enough to switch the focus away from meeting. 
However, it is enough to make it 
candidate, which would permit a switch in focus 
in the very next sentence. If a switch does not 
take place, the candidate's level of activity 
rapidly decays. This is what happens in DI-4, 
where the sentence specifies another participant, 
and the focus stays with meeting. The final 
result of the analysis of discourse DI is a 
stable coal i t ion of the elements of the 
WORK PLACE MEETING frame, and the various 
part~clpan~, times, and locations mentioned in 
the discourse. The final actor focus is the 
speaker, and the final discourse focus is the 
meeting. 
The analysis of discourse D2 proceeds 
identically up to D2-4, where the focus shifts 
from meeting to my office. At the beginning of 
D2-4 there are two candidates for the discourse 
focus, meeting and my office. The occurence of 
the ~ord it then causes both these focuses to 
become equally active. This situation reflects 
our intuitions that at this stage in the sentence 
the co-specifler of i~t is ambiguous. However, 
the occurence of the word small causes a stable 
coalition to form with the MY OFFICE schema, and 
gives the my office focus the ~xtra activation it 
needs to overcome the competing meeting focus. 
Thus, by the end of the sentence, the focus has 
shifted from meeting to my office. By the time 
the it in the final sentence is encountered, 
there is no competing focus, and the anaphor is 
resolved immediately. 
There are a number of fairly obvious 
drawbacks with the above model. The most 
important of these being the specificity of the 
the schema representations. There is no obvious 
way of implementing a system of variable binding, 
where a general schema can be used, and various 
fillers can be bound to, and unbound from, the 
slots. It is not possible to have such symbol 
passing in a connectionist network. Instead, all 
possible slot fillers must be already bound to 
their slots, and selectively activated when 
needed. To make this selective activation less 
unwieldy, a logical step is to use a large 
number of very specific schemas, rather than a 
few general ones. 
Another drawback of the model proposed here 
is that there is no obvious way of showing how 
new schemas might be developed, or how existing 
ones might be modified. One of the basic rules 
in building connectlonist models is that the 
connect ions themselves cannot be modif ied,  
although their associated weights can be. This 
means that any new knowledge must be incorporated 
in an old structure by changing the weights on 
the connections between the old structure and the 
new knowledge. This also implies that the new 
and old elements must already be connected up. In 
spite of the apparent oversupply of neuronal 
elements in the human cortex, to have everything 
connected to virtually everything else seems to 
be profligate. 
Another problem with  connectlonist models is 
their potential "brittleness". When trying to 
program a network to behave in a particular way, 
it is difficult to resist the urge to patch in 
arbitrary fixes here and there. There are, as 
yet, nO equivalents of structured programming 
techniques for networks. However, there are some 
hopeful signs that researchers are identifying 
basic network types whose behavior is robust over 
a range of conditions. In particular, there are 
the wlnner-take-all and regulated networks. The 
latter type, permits the specification of upper 
and lower bounds on the activity of a sub- 
network, which allows the designer to avoid the 
twin perils of total saturation of the network on 
the one hand, and total silence on the other. A 
reliable taxonomy of sub-networks would greatly 
aid the designer in building robust networks.

VI CONCLUSION 
Th is  paper  b r ie f ly  descr ibed  the 
connectlonist approach to cognitive modelling, 
and showed how it might be applied to langauge 
processing. A connectionist model of language 
processing was outlined, which employed schemas 
and focusing techniques to analyse fragments of 
discourse. The paper described how the model was 
successfully able to resolve simple i__ttanaphora.
