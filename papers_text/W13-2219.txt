Abstract
This paper describes OmnifluentTM Trans-
late ? a state-of-the-art hybrid MT sys-
tem capable of high-quality, high-speed
translations of text and speech. The sys-
tem participated in the English-to-French
and Russian-to-English WMT evaluation
tasks with competitive results. The
features which contributed the most to
high translation quality were training data
sub-sampling methods, document-specific
models, as well as rule-based morpholog-
ical normalization for Russian. The latter
improved the baseline Russian-to-English
BLEU score from 30.1 to 31.3% on a held-
out test set.
1 Introduction
Omnifluent Translate is a comprehensive multilin-
gual translation platform developed at SAIC that
automatically translates both text and audio con-
tent. SAIC?s technology leverages hybrid machine
translation, combining features of both rule-based
machine and statistical machine translation for im-
proved consistency, fluency, and accuracy of trans-
lation output.
In the WMT 2013 evaluation campaign, we
trained and tested the Omnifluent system on the
English-to-French and Russian-to-English tasks.
We chose the En?Fr task because Omnifluent En?
Fr systems are already extensively used by SAIC?s
commercial customers: large human translation
service providers, as well as a leading fashion de-
signer company (Matusov, 2012). Our Russian-to-
English system also produces high-quality transla-
tions and is currently used by a US federal govern-
ment customer of SAIC.
Our experimental efforts focused mainly on the
effective use of the provided parallel and monolin-
gual data, document-level models, as well using
rules to cope with the morphological complexity
of the Russian language. While striving for the
best possible translation quality, our goal was to
avoid those steps in the translation pipeline which
would make a real-time use of the Omnifluent sys-
tem impossible. For example, we did not integrate
re-scoring of N-best lists with huge computation-
ally expensive models, nor did we perform system
combination of different system variants. This al-
lowed us to create a MT system that produced our
primary evaluation submission with the translation
speed of 18 words per second1. This submission
had a BLEU score of 24.2% on the Russian-to-
English task2, and 27.3% on the English-to-French
task. In contrast to many other submissions from
university research groups, our evaluation system
can be turned into a fully functional, commer-
cially deployable on-line system with the same
high level of translation quality and speed within
a single work day.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
the next section, we describe the core capabilities
of the Omnifluent Translate systems. Section 3
explains our data selection and filtering strategy.
In Section 4 we present the document-level trans-
lation and language models. Section 5 describes
morphological transformations of Russian. In sec-
tions 6 we present an extension to the system that
allows for automatic spelling correction. In Sec-
tion 7, we discuss the experiments and their evalu-
ation. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 8.
2 Core System Capabilities
The Omnifluent system is a state-of-the-art hybrid
MT system that originates from the AppTek tech-
nology acquired by SAIC (Matusov and Ko?pru?,
2010a). The core of the system is a statistical
search that employs a combination of multiple

probabilistic translation models, including phrase-
based and word-based lexicons, as well as reorder-
ing models and target n-gram language models.
The retrieval of matching phrase pairs given an
input sentence is done efficiently using an algo-
rithm based on the work of (Zens, 2008). The
main search algorithm is the source cardinality-
synchronous search. The goal of the search is to
find the most probable segmentation of the source
sentence into non-empty non-overlapping contigu-
ous blocks, select the most probable permutation
of those blocks, and choose the best phrasal trans-
lations for each of the blocks at the same time. The
concatenation of the translations of the permuted
blocks yields a translation of the whole sentence.
In practice, the permutations are limited to allow
for a maximum of M ?gaps? (contiguous regions
of uncovered word positions) at any time during
the translation process. We set M to 2 for the
English-to-French translation to model the most
frequent type of reordering which is the reorder-
ing of an adjective-noun group. The value of M
for the Russian-to-English translation is 3.
The main differences of Omnifluent Trans-
late as compared to the open-source MT sys-
tem Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) is a reordering
model that penalizes each deviation from mono-
tonic translation instead of assigning costs propor-
tional to the jump distance (4 features as described
by Matusov and Ko?pru? (2010b)) and a lexicaliza-
tion of this model when such deviations depend on
words or part-of-speech (POS) tags of the last cov-
ered and current word (2 features, see (Matusov
and Ko?pru?, 2010a)). Also, the whole input doc-
ument is always visible to the system, which al-
lows the use of document-specific translation and
language models. In translation, multiple phrase
tables can be interpolated linearly on the count
level, as the phrasal probabilities are computed
on-the-fly. Finally, various novel phrase-level fea-
tures have been implemented, including binary
topic/genre/phrase type indicators and translation
memory match features (Matusov, 2012).
The Omnifluent system also allows for partial
or full rule-based translations. Specific source lan-
guage entities can be identified prior to the search,
and rule-based translations of these entities can
be either forced to be chosen by the MT system,
or can compete with phrase translation candidates
from the phrase translation model. In both cases,
the language model context at the boundaries of
the rule-based translations is taken into account.
Omnifluent Translate identifies numbers, dates,
URLs, e-mail addresses, smileys, etc. with manu-
ally crafted regular expressions and uses rules to
convert them to the appropriate target language
form. In addition, it is possible to add manual
translation rules to the statistical phrase table of
the system.
3 Training Data Selection and Filtering
We participated in the constrained data track of
the evaluation in order to obtain results which are
comparable to the majority of the other submis-
sions. This means that we trained our systems only
on the provided parallel and monolingual data.
3.1 TrueCasing
Instead of using a separate truecasing module, we
apply an algorithm for finding the true case of the
first word of each sentence in the target training
data and train truecased phrase tables and a true-
cased language model3. Thus, the MT search de-
cides on the right case of a word when ambiguities
exist. Also, the Omnifluent Translate system has
an optional feature to transfer the case of an input
source word to the word in the translation output
to which it is aligned. Although this approach is
not always error-free, there is an advantage to it
when the input contains previously unseen named
entities which use common words that have to be
capitalized. We used this feature for our English-
to-French submission only.
3.2 Monolingual Data
For the French language model, we trained sepa-
rate 5-gram models on the two GigaWord corpora
AFP and APW, on the provided StatMT data for
2007?2012 (3 models), on the EuroParl data, and
on the French side of the bilingual data. LMs were
estimated and pruned using the IRSTLM toolkit
(Federico et al, 2008). We then tuned a linear
combination of these seven individual parts to op-
timum perplexity on WMT test sets 2009 and 2010
and converted them for use with the KenLM li-
brary (Heafield, 2011). Similarly, our English LM
was a linear combination of separate LMs built for
GigaWord AFP, APW, NYT, and the other parts,
StatMT 2007?2012, Europarl/News Commentary,
and the Yandex data, which was tuned for best per-
plexity on the WMT 2010-2013 test sets.
3Source sentences were lowercased.

3.3 Parallel Data
Since the provided parallel corpora had differ-
ent levels of noise and quality of sentence align-
ment, we followed a two-step procedure for fil-
tering the data. First, we trained a baseline sys-
tem on the ?good-quality? data (Europarl and
News Commentary corpora) and used it to trans-
late the French side of the Common Crawl data
into English. Then, we computed the position-
independent word error rate (PER) between the
automatic translation and the target side on the
segment level and only kept those original seg-
ment pairs, the PER for which was between 10%
and 60%. With this criterion, we kept 48% of the
original 3.2M sentence pairs of the common-crawl
data.
To leverage the significantly larger Multi-UN
parallel corpus, we performed perplexity-based
data sub-sampling, similarly to the method de-
scribed e. g. by Axelrod et al (2011). First, we
trained a relatively small 4-gram LM on the source
(English) side of our development data and evalu-
ation data. Then, we used this model to compute
the perplexity of each Multi-UN source segment.
We kept the 700K segments with the lowest per-
plexity (normalized by the segment length), so that
the size of the Multi-UN corpus does not exceed
30% of the total parallel corpus size. This proce-
dure is the only part of the translation pipeline for
which we currently do not have a real-time solu-
tion. Yet such a real-time algorithm can be imple-
mented without problems: we word-align the orig-
inal corpora using GIZA++ahead of time, so that af-
ter sub-sampling we only need to perform a quick
phrase extraction. To obtain additional data for
the document-level models only (see Section 4),
we also applied this procedure to the even larger
Gigaword corpus and thus selected 1M sentence
pairs from this corpus.
We used the PER-based procedure as described
above to filter the Russian-English Common-
crawl corpus to 47% of its original size. The base-
line system used to obtain automatic translation
for the PER-based filtering was trained on News
Commentary, Yandex, and Wiki headlines data.
4 Document-level Models
As mentioned in the introduction, the Omnifluent
system loads a whole source document at once.
Thus, it is possible to leverage document context
by using document-level models which score the
phrasal translations of sentences from a specific
document only and are unloaded after processing
of this document.
To train a document-level model for a specific
document from the development, test, or evalua-
tion data, we automatically extract those source
sentences from the background parallel training
data which have (many) n-grams (n=2...7) in com-
mon with the source sentences of the document.
Then, to train the document-level LM we take the
target language counterparts of the extracted sen-
tences and train a standard 3-gram LM on them.
To train the document-level phrase table, we take
the corresponding word alignments for the ex-
tracted source sentences and their target counter-
parts, and extract the phrase table as usual. To
keep the additional computational overhead min-
imal yet have enough data for model estimation,
we set the parameters of the n-gram matching
in such a way that the number of sentences ex-
tracted for document-level training is around 20K
for document-level phrase tables and 100K for
document-level LMs.
In the search, the counts from the document-
level phrase table are linearly combined with the
counts from the background phrase table trained
on the whole training data. The document-level
LM is combined log-linearly with the general LM
and all the other models and features. The scal-
ing factors for the document-level LMs and phrase
tables are not document-specific; neither is the
linear interpolation factor for a document-level
phrase table which we tuned manually on a devel-
opment set. The scaling factor for the document-
level LM was optimized together with the other
scaling factors using Minimum Error Rate Train-
ing (MERT, see (Och, 2003)).
For English-to-French translation, we used both
document-level phrase tables and document-level
LMs; the background data for them contained the
sub-sampled Gigaword corpus (see Section 3.3).
We used only the document-level LMs for the
Russian-to-English translation. They were ex-
tracted from the same data that was used to train
the background phrase table.
5 Morphological Transformations of
Russian
Russian is a morphologically rich language. Even
for large vocabulary MT systems this leads to data
sparseness and high out-of-vocabulary rate. To
160
mitigate this problem, we developed rules for re-
ducing the morphological complexity of the lan-
guage, making it closer to English in terms of the
used word forms. Another goal was to ease the
translation of some morphological and syntactic
phenomena in Russian by simplifying them; this
included adding artificial function words.
We used the pymorphy morphological analyzer4
to analyze Russian words in the input text. The
output of pymorphy is one or more alternative
analyses for each word, each of which includes
the POS tag plus morphological categories such
as gender, tense, etc. The analyses are generated
based on a manual dictionary, do not depend on
the context, and are not ordered by probability of
any kind. However, to make some functional mod-
ifications to the input sentences, we applied the
tool not to the vocabulary, but to the actual input
text; thus, in some cases, we introduced a context
dependency. To deterministically select one of the
pymorphy?s analyses, we defined a POS priority
list. Nouns had a higher priority than adjectives,
and adjectives higher priority than verbs. Other-
wise we relied on the first analysis for each POS.
The main idea behind our hand-crafted rules
was to normalize any ending/suffix which does not
carry information necessary for correct translation
into English. Under normalization we mean the
restoration of some ?base? form. The pymorphy
analyzer API provides inflection functions so that
each word could be changed into a particular form
(case, tense, etc.). We came up with the following
normalization rules:
? convert all adjectives and participles to first-
person masculine singular, nominative case;
? convert all nouns to the nominative case
keeping the plural/singular distinction;
? for nouns in genitive case, add the artificial
function word ?of ? after the last noun before
the current one, if the last noun is not more
than 4 positions away;
? for each verb infinitive, add the artificial
function word ?to ? in front of it;
? convert all present-tense verbs to their infini-
tive form;
? convert all past-tense verbs to their past-tense
first-person masculine singular form;
? convert all future-tense verbs to the artificial
function word ?will ? + the infinitive;
4https://bitbucket.org/kmike/pymorphy
? For verbs ending with reflexive suffixes
??/??, add the artificial function word ?sya ?
in front of the verb and remove the suf-
fix. This is done to model the reflexion (e.g.
??? ????????? ??? sya_ ??????? ? ?he
washed himself?, here ?sya ? corresonds to
?himself?), as well as, in other cases, the pas-
sive mood (e.g. ??? ???????????  ??
sya_ ?????????? ?it is inserted?).
An example that is characteristic of all these mod-
ifications is given in Figure 1.
It is worth noting that not all of these transfor-
mations are error-free because the analysis is also
not always error-free. Also, sometimes there is in-
formation loss (as in case of the instrumental noun
case, for example, which we currently drop instead
of finding the right artificial preposition to express
it). Nevertheless, our experiments show that this is
a successful morphological normalization strategy
for a statistical MT system.
6 Automatic Spelling Correction
Machine translation input texts, even if prepared
for evaluations such as WMT, still contain spelling
errors, which lead to serious translation errors. We
extended the Omnifluent system by a spelling cor-
rection module based on Hunspell5 ? an open-
source spelling correction software and dictionar-
ies. For each input word that is unknown both to
the Omnifluent MT system and to Hunspell, we
add those Hunspell?s spelling correction sugges-
tions to the input which are in the vocabulary of
the MT system. They are encoded in a lattice and
assigned weights. The weight of a suggestion is
inversely proportional to its rank in the Hunspell?s
list (the first suggestions are considered to be more
probable) and proportional to the unigram proba-
bility of the word(s) in the suggestion. To avoid
errors related to unknown names, we do not apply
spelling correction to words which begin with an
uppercase letter.
The lattice is translated by the decoder using
the method described in (Matusov et al, 2008);
the globally optimal suggestion is selected in the
translation process. On the English-to-French
task, 77 out of 3000 evaluation data sentences
were translated differently because of automatic
spelling correction. The BLEU score on these
sentences improved from 22.4 to 22.6%. Man-
ual analysis of the results shows that in around

70% of the cases the MT system picks the right
or almost right correction. We applied automatic
spelling correction also to the Russian-to-English
evaluation submissions. Here, the spelling correc-
tion was applied to words which remained out-of-
vocabulary after applying the morphological nor-
malization rules.
7 Experiments
7.1 Development Data and Evaluation
Criteria
For our experiments, we divided the 3000-
sentence newstest-2012 test set from the WMT
2012 evaluation in two roughly equal parts, re-
specting document boundaries. The first part we
used as a tuning set for N-best list MERT opti-
mization (Och, 2003). We used the second part
as a test set to measure progress; the results on it
are reported below. We computed case-insensitive
BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) for optimiza-
tion and evaluation. Only one reference translation
was available.
7.2 English-to-French System
The baseline system for the English-to-French
translation direction was trained on Europarl and
News Commentary corpora. The word align-
ment was obtained by training HMM and IBM
Model 3 alignment models and combining their
two directions using the ?grow-diag-final? heuris-
tic (Koehn, 2004). The first line in Table 1 shows
the result for this system when we only use the
standard features (phrase translation and word lex-
icon costs in both directions, the base reorder-

ing features as described in (Matusov and Ko?pru?,
2010b) and the 5-gram target LM). When we
also optimize the scaling factors for extended fea-
tures, including the word-based and POS-based
lexicalized reordering models described in (Ma-
tusov and Ko?pru?, 2010a), we improve the BLEU
score by 0.4% absolute. Extracting phrase pairs
from three different, equally weighted alignment
heuristics improves the score by another 0.3%.
The next big improvement comes from using
document-level language models and phrase ta-
bles, which include Gigaword data. Especially the
PER decreases significantly, which indicates that
the document-level models help, in most cases, to
select the right word translations. Another signifi-
cant improvement comes from adding parts of the
Common-crawl and Multi-UN data, sub-sampled
with the perplexity-based method as described in
Section 3.3. The settings corresponding to the last
line of Table 1 were used to produce the Omniflu-
ent primary submission, which resulted in a BLEU
score of 27.3 on the WMT 2013 test set.
After the deadline for submission, we discov-
ered a bug in the extraction of the phrase table
which had reduced the positive impact of the ex-
tended phrase-level features. We re-ran the opti-
mization on our tuning set and obtained a BLEU
score of 27.7% on the WMT 2013 evaluation set.
7.3 Russian-to-English System
The first experiment with the Russian-to-English
system was to show the positive effect of the
morphological transformations described in Sec-
tion 5. Table 2 shows the result of the baseline
system, trained using full forms of the Russian
162
words on the News Commentary, truecased Yan-
dex and Wiki Headlines data. When applying the
morphological transformations described in Sec-
tion 5 both in training and translation, we obtain
a significant improvement in BLEU of 1.3% ab-
solute. The out-of-vocabulary rate was reduced
from 0.9 to 0.5%. This shows that the morpholog-
ical reduction actually helps to alleviate the data
sparseness problem and translate structurally com-
plex constructs in Russian.
Significant improvements are obtained for Ru?
En through the use of extended features, including
the lexicalized and ?POS?-based reordering mod-
els. As the ?POS? tags for the Russian words we
used the pymorphy POS tag selected deterministi-
cally based on our priority list, together with the
codes for additional morphological features such
as tense, case, and gender. In contrast to the En?
Fr task, document-level models did not help here,
most probably because we used only LMs and
only trained on sub-sampled data that was already
part of the background phrase table. The last boost
in translation quality was obtained by adding those
segments of the cleaned Common-crawl data to
the phrase table training which are similar to the
development and evaluation data in terms of LM
perplexity. The BLEU score in the last line of Ta-
ble 2 corresponds to Omnifluent?s BLEU score of
24.2% on the WMT 2013 evaluation data. This is
only 1.7% less than the score of the best BLEU-
ranked system in the evaluation.
8 Summary and Future Work
In this paper we described the Omnifluent hybrid
MT system and its use for the English-to-French
and Russian-to-English WMT tasks. We showed
that it is important for good translation quality to
perform careful data filtering and selection, as well
as use document-specific phrase tables and LMs.
We also proposed and evaluated rule-based mor-
phological normalizations for Russian. They sig-
nificantly improved the Russian-to-English trans-
lation quality. In contrast to some evaluation par-
ticipants, the presented high-quality system is fast
and can be quickly turned into a real-time system.
In the future, we intend to improve the rule-based
component of the system, allowing users to add
and delete translation rules on-the-fly.
