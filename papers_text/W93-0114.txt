Abstract  
In this paper, we describe the most recent 
implementation and evaluation of the proper noun 
categorization and standardization module of the DR- 
LINK document detection system being developed at 
Syracuse University, under the auspices of ARPA's 
TIPSTER program. We also discuss the expansion of 
group common nouns and group proper nouns to 
enhance retrieval recall. Successful proper noun 
boundary identification within the part of speech tagger 
is essential for successful categorization. The proper 
noun classification module is designed to assign a 
category code to each proper noun entity, using 30 
categories generated from corpus analysis. 
Standardization f variant proper nouns occurs at three 
levels of processing. Expansion of group proper nouns 
and group common nouns is performed on queries. 
Standardization and categorization is performed on 
queries and documents. DR-LINK's overall precision 
for proper noun categorization was 93%, based on 589 
proper nouns occurring in the evaluation set. 
1. Introduction 
In information retrieval, proper nouns, group proper 
nouns, and group common nouns present unique 
problems. Proper nouns are recognized as an imp(xlant 
source of information for detecting relevant documents 
in information retrieval and extracting contents from a 
text (Ran, 1991). Yet most of the unknown words in 
texts which degrade the performance ofnatural language 
processing information retrieval systems are proper 
nouns. Group proper nouns (e.g., Middle East) and 
group common ouns (e.g., third world) will not match 
on their constituents unless the group entity is 
mentioned in the document. The proper noun processor 
herein described is a module in the DR-LINK system 
(Liddy et at, in press) for document detection being 
developed under the auspices of ARPA's TIPSTER 
program. 
Our approach to solving the group common oun and 
the group proper noun problem has been to expand the 
appropriate rms in a query, such as 'third world,' to all 
possible names and variants of third world entities. For 
all proper nouns, our system assigns categories from a 
proper noun classification scheme to every proper noun 
in both documents and queries to permit proper noun 
matching at the category level. Category matching is 
more efficient than keyword matching if the query 
requires entities of a particular type. Standardization 
provides a means of efficiently categorizing and 
retrieving documents containing variant forms of a 
proper noun. 
2. Proper Noun Boundary 
I dent i f i ca t ion  
In our most recent implementation, which has improved 
from our initial attempt (Paik et at, in press), 
documents are first processed using a probabilistic part 
of speech tagger (Meeter et al 1991). Then a proper 
noun boundary identifier utilizes proper noun part of 
speech tags from the previous tage to bracket adjacent 
proper nouns. Additionally, heuristics developed 
through corpus analysis are applied to bracket proper 
noun phrases with embedded conjunctions and 
prepositions as one unit. For example, a list of proper 
154 
nouns will be bracketed with non-adjacent proper nouns, 
if 'of is an embedded preposition. Some examples of 
preceding proper nouns include Council, Ministry, 
Secretary, University, etc. 
The success of ratio of our proper noun boundary 
identification module is approximately 96% in 
comparison to our initial system's 95% (Paik et ai, in 
press). This improvement was achieved by the re- 
ordering of the data flow. A general-purpose phrase 
bracketter, which was applied before the proper noun 
boundary identification heuristics for non-adjacent 
proper nouns, is now applied to texts after all the proper 
noun categorization a d standardization steps. Thus, we 
have eliminated one major source of error, which is the 
conflict between the general-purpose noun phrase 
bracketter and the proper noun boundary identification 
heuristics. For example, embedded prepositions in a 
proper noun phrase are sometimes recognized as the 
beginnings of prepositional phrases by the general- 
purpose phrase bracketter. The remaining 3% of error is 
due mainly to incorrect proper noun tags assigned to the 
uncommon first word of a sentence by the part of 
speech tagger. 
3. Proper Noun Classification Scheme 
Our proper noun classification Scheme, which was 
developed through corpus analysis of newspaper texts, 
is organized as a hierarchy which consists of 9 
branching nodes and 30 terminal nodes. Currently, we 
use only the terminal nodes to assign categories to 
proper nouns in texts. Based on an analysis of 588 
proper nouns from a set of randomly selected ocuments 
from Wall Street Journal, we found that our 29 
meaningful categories correctly accounted for 89% of all 
proper nouns in texts. We reserve the last category as a 
miscellaneous category. Figure 1 shows a hierarchical 
view of our proper noun categorization scheme. 
The system categorizes all identified proper nouns using 
several methods. The first approach is to compare the 
proper noun with a list of all identified prefixes, infixes 
and suffixes for possible categorization based on these 
lexicai clues. If the system cannot identify a category 
in this stage, the proper noun is passed to an alias 
database to determine if the proper noun has an alternate 
name form. If this is the case, the proper noun is 
standardized and categ~ized atthis point. If there is no 
match in the alias database, the proper noun moves to 
the knowledge-base look up. These databases have been 
constructed using online lexical resources including the 
Gazetteer, the World Factbase, and the Executive Desk 
Reference. If the knowledge-base look up is not 
successful, the proper noun is run through a context 
hueristics application developed from corpus analysis, 
which suggests certain categories of proper nouns. For 
example, if a proper noun is followed by a comma nd 
another proper noun, which has been identified as a 
state, we will label the proper noun as a city name, 
e.g., Time, Illinois. Finally, if the proper noun has 
still not been categorized, it is compared against a list 
of first names generated from the corpus for a final 
personal name categorization check. If the proper noun 
has not been categorized atthis stage, it will be labeled 
with the 'miscellaneous' category code. 
For the categorization system to work efficiently, 
variant erms must be standardized. This procedure is
performed at three levels, with the prefixes, infixes and 
suffixes standardized first. Next, the proper nouns in 
alias forms are standardized into the official form where 
available. These standardization techniques improve the 
retrieval performance. Finally, if a proper noun was 
mentioned at least twice in a document, for instance, 
Analog Devices, Inc. and later as Analog Devices, a 
partial string match of a proper noun is co-indexed for 
reference resolution. This technique allows for a full 
representation of a proper noun entity. Figure 2 
illustrates the flow of the proper noun categorization 
system within the t-h-St stages of DR-LINK processing. 
When standardization a d categorization have been 
completed, a new field is added to both the query and the 
document containing the proper noun and the 
corresponding category codes. These fields are then used 
for efficient matching and representation. 
4. Use o f  P roper  Nouns  in Match ing  
Both the lexical entry for the proper noun or the 
category code may be used for matching documents o 
queries. For example, if a query is about a boarder 
incursion, we can limit the potentially relevant 
documents o those documents which contain at least 
two different country names, flagged by the two country 
category codes in the proper noun field. Using the 
standardized fern of a proper noun reduces the number 
of possible variants which the system would otherwise 
need to search for. 
While the category matching strategy is useful in many 
cases, an expansion of a group proper noun such as 
'European Community', which occurs in a query, to 
member country names is also beneficial. Relevant 
documents for a query about sanctions against Japan by 
European Community countries are likely to mention 
actions against Japan by member countries by name

rather than the term in the query, European 
Community. We are currently using a proper noun 
expansion database with 168 expandable nlries for 
query processing. In addition, certain ccmunon ouns or 
noun phrases in queries uch as 'socialist countries' need 
to be expanded to the names of the countries which 
satisfy the definition of the term to improve 
performance in detecting relevant documents. The 
system consults a list of common nouns and noun 
phrases which can be expanded into proper nouns and 
actively searches for these terms during the query 
processing stage. Currently, the common noun 
expansion database has 37 entries. 
The creation and use of proper noun information is first 
utilized in the DR-LINK system as an addition to the 
subject-content based filtering module which uses a 
scheme of 122 subject field codes (SFCs) from a 
machine readable dictionary rather than keywords to 
represent documents. Although SFC representation a d 
matching provides a very good first level of document 
filtering, not all proper nouns reveal subject 
information, so the proper noun concepts in texts are 
not actually represented in the SFC vectors. 
In our new implementation, categorized and standardized 
proper nouns are combined with Text Structure (Liddy 
et al in press-b) information for matching queries 
against documents. Text Structure is a recognition of a 
discernible, predictable schema of texts of a particular 
type. The Text Structurer module in the DR-LINK 
system delineates the discourse-level organization of 
document content so that processing at later stages can 
focus on those components identified by the Text 
Structurer as being the most likely location in the 
document where the information requested in a query is 
to be found. 
All proper nouns in a document collection are indexed 
in an inverted file with the document accession umber, 
the Text Structure component in which the proper noun 
was located, and the category code. For processing the 
queries for their proper noun requirements, we have 
developed a Boolean criteria script which determines 
which proper nouns or combinations of proper nouns 
are needed from certain Text Structure components in 
each query. These requirements are then run against he 
propel noun inverted file to rank documents according to 
the extent to which they match these requirements. 
Also, the categorization information of proper nouns is 
currently used in a later module of the system, which 
extracts concepts and relations from text to produce a
more refined representation. For example, proper nouns 
may reveal the location of a company or the nationality 
of an individual. 
We do not have information retrieval evaluation results 
based on the new implementation using the proper noun 
information in conjunction with the Text Structure 
information. However, in previous testing of our 
initial system which did not utilize Text Structure 
information (Paik et al in press), reranking of 
documents received from the SFC module, based on the 
degree of proper noun requirements matching a set of 
queries against a document collection, resulted in 
placing all the relevant documents within the top 28% 
156

157 
of the document collection. It should also be noted that 
the precision figures on the output of the SFC module 
plus the proper noun matching module produced very 
reasonable precision results (.22 for the ll-point 
precision average), even though the combination of 
these two modules was never intended to function as a 
stand-alone r trieval system. 
Finally, the proper noun extraction and categorization 
module, although developed as part of the DR-LINK 
system, could be used to provide improved ocument 
representation for any information retrieval system. 
The standardization a d categorization features permit 
queries and documents to be matched with greater 
precision, while the expansion functions of group 
proper nouns and group common ouns improve recall. 
5. Per fo rmance  Eva luat ion  
While we are currently processing more than one 
gigabyte of text using the new version of the proper 
noun categorizer for the TIPSTER 24 month testing, 
the evaluation of the proper noun categorizer herein 
reported is based on 25 randomly selected Wall Slreet 
Journal documents, which were compared to the proper 
noun categorzafion done by a human. This document 
set was also used in evaluating our initial version of the 
categorizer (Paik et al in press). Table 1 demonstrates 
the performance of the categorizex on 589 proper nouns 
occurring in the test set. In addition to 589 proper 
nouns, 14 common words were incorrectly identified as 
proper nouns due to errors by the part of speech tagger 
and typos in the original text; and the boundaries of 11 
proper nouns were incorrectly recognized due to unusual 
proper noun phrases such as, 'Virginia Group to 
Alleviate Smoking in Public', which the proper noun 
boundary identification heuristics has failed to bracket. 
64 proper nouns were correctly categorized as 
miscellaneous a they did not belong to any of our 29 
meaningful categories. This may be considered a
coverage problem in our proper noun categorization 
scheme, not an error in our categorizer. Some examples 
of the proper nouns belonging to the miscellaneous 
category are: 'Promised Land', 'Mickey Mouse', and 
'IUD'. The last row of Table 1 shows the overall 
precision of our categorizer based on the proper nouns 
which belong to the 29 meaningful categ~ies. 
In our initial implementation (Palk et al in press), 
errors in categorizing person and city names accounted 
for 68% of the total errors. To improve performance, we 
added a list of common f'LrSt names, which was semi-

Table 1: DR-LINK Proper Noun Categorizer Performance 
automatically extracted from Associated Press and Wall 
Street Journal corpora, as a special exicon to consult 
when there is no match using all categorization 
procedures. This addition improved our precision of 
categorizing person names from the initial system's 
46% to 90%. 
The errors in categorizing city names, in our initial 
categorizer, were mainly due to two problems. They are: 
1) The locational source of the news, when mentioned 
at the beginning of the document, is usually capitalized 
in Wall Street Journal. This special convention of 
158 
newspaper texts caused miscategorizing the locational 
proper nouns (usually city names) as a miscellaneous; 
and 
2) City names which were not in our proper noun 
knowledge base 
The first problem was handled in our new proper noun 
categorizer by moving the locatioual information of the 
news story to a new field, '<DATELINE>', and 
normalizing capitalization (from all upper case texts to 
mixed ~se) atthe document preprocessing stage before 
the part of speech tagging. For example, if a story is 
about a company in Dallas then the text will be as 
below: 
<DOC> 
DALLAS: American Medical Insurance Inc. said that ... 
. . .  
</DOC> 
After the new preprocessing module is applied, the text 
will be as below: 
<DATELINE> Dallas </DATELINE> 
<DOC> 
American Medical Insurance Inc. said that ... 
. . .  
</DOC> 
For the second: problem, we incorporated a context rule 
for identifying city names to our categorizer. The rule is 
that city names are followed by a country name or a 
province name from the United States and Canada 
unless the name is very well known. For example, 'Van 
Nuys', can now be categorized as a city name as it is 
preceded by a valid United States province name. 
... Van Nuys, Calif.... 
By adding the above new procedures to our 
categorization system as well as some well known city 
names wh ich  are not province capitals or heavily 
populated places based on IDA's Gazetteer to our proper 
noun knowledge base, the precision of categorizing city 
names has improved from initial system's 25% to 
100%. 
The overall precision of  our new proper noun 
categorizer has improved to 93% from 77% based on 
our initial attempt (Paik et al in press) including proper 
nouns which are correctly categorized as miscellaneous. 
This significant advancement was achieved by adding a 
few sensible context heuristics and modification of the 
knowledge base. These additions or modifications were 
based on the analysis of randomly selected ocuments. 
We feel the limitations of not manually updating our 
proper noun knowledge base for uncommon proper 
nouns when confronted with proper nouns such as 
'Place de la Reunion' and 'Pacific Northwest'. Thus, we 
are currently developing a strategy based on context 
clues using locational prepositions as well as 
appositional phrases to improve categorization of  
uncommon proper nouns.

which is affected by the proper noun phrase boundary

8.  Conc lus ion  
To compare our proper noun categorization results to 
the evaluation of a system with similar goals in the 
fiterature, we chose Coates-Stephcns' (1992) result on 
acquiring enus information of proper nouns to compare 
our overall precision. While his approach is to acquire 
information about unknown proper nouns' detailed 
genus and differentia description, we consider our 
approach of assigning a category from a classification 
scheme of 30 classes to an  unknown proper noun 
generally similar in purpose to his acquisition of genus 
information. However, it should be noted that our 
method for assigning categories to proper nouns is 
different from Coates-Stephens' method, as we rely 
more on built-in knowledge bases while his approach 
relies more on context. 
Based on 100 unseen documents which had 535 
159 
unknown proper nouns, FUNES (Coates-Stephens, 
1992) successfully acquired genus information for 340 
proper nouns. Of the 195 proper nouns not acquired, 92 
were due to the system's parse failure. Thus, the success 
ratio based on only the proper nouns which were 
analyzed by the system, was 77%. DR-LINK's proper 
noun categorizer's overall precision, which is computed 
with the same formula, was 93%, including proper 
nouns which were correctly categorized as 
miscellaneous. 
Katoh's (1991) evaluation of his machinetranslation 
system, which was based on translating the 1,000 most 
frequent names in the AP news corpus, successfully 
analyzed 94% of the 1,000 names. Our precision figure 
of categorizing person ames was 90%. 
Finally, the evaluation result from Rau's (1991) 
company name extractor is compared to the precision 
figure of our company name categorization. Both 
systems relied heavily on company name suffixes. 
Rau's result showed 97.5% success ratio of the 
program's extraction of company names that had 
company name suffixes. Our system's precision figure 
was 88%. However, it should be noted that our result is 
based on all company names, including those which did 
not have any clear company name suffixes or prefixes.
