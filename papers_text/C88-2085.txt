Abstract  
A d iagnos ing  procedure  to be used in in te l l i -  
gent systems for language ins t ruct ion  is 
presented.  Based on a knowledge representa -  
t ion scheme for a cer ta in  c lass  of syntact i c  
cor rectness  cond i t ions  the sys tem carr ies  out 
a thorough ana lys i s  of poss ib le  error  hypoth-  
eses and their  consequences.  A compar i son  
with ear l ie r  a t tempts  shows a c lear ly  im- 
proved prec is ion  of d iagnost i c  results. F irst  
of all, the procedure  concent ra te  s on an 
exact loca l i za t ion  of rule v io lat ions,  but - 
if des i red  - is able to in fer  in fo rmat ion  
about factua l  fau l ts  as well. 
I .  INTRODUCTION 
Error  ant i c ipat ion  is a key issue so far, 
as systems for computeP  ass i s ted  language 
learn ing  are to be enhanced with d iagnost i c  
and exp lanatory  capabi l i t ies .  T rad i t iona l  
approaches  do a lways re ly  on  the centra l  
assumpt ion  that any mistake poss ib ly  done by 
a s tudent  can be fo reseen by the author  of a 
teach ing  exerc ise  in order  to supp ly  the 
tu tor ing  sys tem with a co l lec t ion  of ade- 
quate responses  to all the d i f fe rent  errors  
and  error  combinat ions  which might  occur  in 
real t ra in ing  sessions. 
Cons ider ing  the enormous  f lex ib i l i ty  of 
natura l  language, however, this assumpt ion  is 
on ly  jus t i f ied  for smal l  c lasses  of very 
s imple .type exercises,  and most e f for ts  are 
spent into dev is ing  sens ib le  teach ing  aids 
desp i te  the absence of appropr ia te  d iagnost i c  
techniques.  The author  is forced to concen-  
trate on s ing le  teach ing  programs wi thout  
a lmost  any chance to genera l i se  f rom his 
resu l ts  and to reuse parts of it in other  
contexts  later. 
More ambi t ious  so lu t ions  cer ta in ly  can be 
expected, if it becomes feas ib le  to der ive  
the d iagnost i c  and exp lanatory  ab i l i t ies  of 
the des i red  sys tem d i rec t ly  f rom r u 1 e s 
for what is cons idered  to be a cor rect  con- 
s t ruct ion  in a sens ib le  res t r i c ted  subset  of 
natura l  language, ins tead of us ing  pre- 
se lec ted  l ists  of poss ib ly  occur r ing  answers. 
In this respect, research  in in te l l igent  
sys tems for second language learn ing  sooner  
or later  wil l  fo l low s imi la r  l ines as a par- 
al le l  deve lopment  in the f ie ld  of expert  
systems, where a dras t i ca l ly  improved d iagno-  
s t i c  behav iour  is a t tempted  by mode l l ing  
s t ructure  and funct ion  of the app l i ca t ion  
domain  (y ie ld ing  so ca l led  "deep model led"  
expert  systems, which then are able to inves-  
t igate faul ts  by s imulat ing  them) rather  than 
co l lec t ing  huge amounts  of symptom-or iented  
regu lar i t ies  to be used in a s t ra ight fo rward  
in ference  procedure  on a sur face  level  (c. f. 
for ins tance  Davis  1984). 
By inc lud ing  semantic,  syntact i c  and 
morpho-syntact ie  regu lar i t ies  into a s ing le  
so lu t ion  Weischede l  et al (1978) proposed a 
sys tem fop in te l l igent  language ins t ruct ion  
that l i kewise  turned out to be the most ambi-  
t ious approach  so far. Even today, a lmost  
exact ly  ten years . later ,  its main  pPemises  
and cha l leng ing  pred ic t ions  obv ious ly  do not 
fu l ly  match the real pPospects  in the field. 
~ven worse, this as well  as more recent  at- 
tempts (Barehan et al 1985, Schwind  1986) 
are s t rong ly  o r iented  on the not ion  of a 
" typ ica l  error". Thus they c lear ly  fal l  short  
of the deep-mode l l ing  ideal  and ape connected  
with a number of c r i t i ca l  shortcomings.  These 
shor tcomings  can be avoided, if it becomes 
poss ib le  to ident i fy  l im i ted  app l i ca t ion  
domains  w i th in  the area of natura l  language 
ins t ruct ion  which a l low a t ra in ing  sys tem to 
be s t r i c t ly  based on the fo l low ing  basic  
pr ie iples:  
(I) Supp ly  the sys tem with on ly  knowledge 
about correctness.  
(2) Devise a d iagnos is  procedure  which is 
independent  of the content  of the knowl-  
edge base. 
Cur rent ly  used semant ic  representat ion  
schemes in genera l  seem much too rough to 
capture all the rather  subt le  d i s t inc t ions  
414 
between an acceptab le  natura l  language ex-  
p ress ion  and a dev iant  one in a su f f i c ient l~  
sys temat ic  way. Even  if  the necessary  means  
wou ld  be ava i lab le  the prob lem of  ac tua l ly  
cod ing  the des i red  in fo rmat ion  for  a rea l i s -  
t ic  domain  remains  to be so lved.  
Bet ter  p rospects  for  a success fu l  imp le -  
mentat ion  o f  these  two pr inc ip les  can  cer -  
ta in ly  be expected  on the syntact i c  level .  
Never the less ,  in o rder  to d iagnose  s t ruc tura l  
e r ro rs  ~ l l l  cur rent ly  known so lu t ions  re ly  
exc lus iw~ly  on the use of "marked"  rules,  
represent ing  typ ica l  mis takes  and be ing  in-  
tended to invoke  appropr ia te  e r ror  messages .  
Th is  p ract i ce  is c lear ly  incons is tent  w i th  
pr ineipl ,~ (I) and  comes  out as noth ing  more  
than  a s imple  sh i f t  of the necess i ty  to 
ant i c ipate  s tudent  behav iour  onto  a new - not  
necessar i l y  more  persp icuous  - level .  
Moreover ,  it l eaves  the sys tem wi th  al l  the 
consequences  of  a pars ing  grammar  b loated  
w i th  numbers  Of fau l t - spec i f i c  rules.  
The domain  I be l ieve  is cur rent ly  r ipes t  
for  a s t r i c t ly  deep-mode l led  proto type  is the 
area  of morpho-syntact ie  cor rec tness  cond i -  
t ions  wh ich  have  to be sat i s f ied  in a g iven  
( i f  nec(!ssary a r t i f i c ia l l y  f ixed)  syntact i c  
env i ronm~nt .  These  cons is tency  const ra in ts  
fop we l l - fo rmed syntact i c  t rees  compr ise  
agreement  re la t ions  as we l l  as case  govern -  
ment  and, as Weischede l  st al. (1978) 
acknowledge,  const i tu te  at leas t  for  lan-  
guages  l i ke  German a major  e r ror  source.  They  
can eas i ly  be expressed  as pred icates  over  
s t ruc tured  sets  of morpho-syntact i c  features  
and, if taken  together ,  fo rm s imple  networks .  
Here  again,  a l l  cur rent  approaches  fa l l  
back  on e i ther  shor t -cut  so lu t ions  (e.g. take  
the f i r~t  pred icate  eva luat ing  to fa lse)  or 
s imp le  h~ur i s t i c  guesses  when t ry ing  to d iag -  
nose (esp. to locate)  cons is tency  errors .  
Heur i s t i cs  (or  the use of ru les -o f - thumb)  
typ ica l ly  is the method o f  one 's  cho ice  when 
be ing  f~ced w i th  a, by  i ts  nature,  i l l -  
de f ined  ?,r ext remely  complex  prob lem.  Obv i -  
ous ly  the domain  of. morpho- -syntact ie  regu lar -  
i t ies  be longs  to ne i ther  the one nor  the 
o ther  category .  
Accord ing ly ,  an invest igat ion  in to  the 
prob lem of d iagnos ing  cons is tency  v io la t ions  
has shown that  an e f f i c ient  and ext remely  
prec ise  d iagnost i c  p rocedure  can  be dev ised ,  
wh ich  prov ides  a sound bas is  for  the genera -  
t ion  of  comprehens ib le  exp lanat ions  ( inc lud-  
ing  proposa ls  for  a proper  so lu t ion) ,  for  a 
va luat ion  of the learn ing  progress  and for an 
adapt ive  determinat ion  of the fu r ther  t ra in -  
inq  s t ra tegy .  Moreover ,  it tu rned  out  that  
non- t r iv ia l  t ra in ing  exerc i ses  based  exclu-- 
s ive ly  on s imple  morpho-syntaet ic  cor rec tness  
cond i t ions  can  wel l  be used  independent ly  of 
an er ror  sens i t ive  ? parser  and add i t iona l ly  
are connected  w i th  a number  of pedagog ica l  
and per fo rmane~ ga ins  ( fo r  a deta i led  d i scus -  
s ion  see Menzel ,  1987 and 1988).  In th is  ease  
the s tudent  can  be gu ided  by an appropr ia te  
sentence  context  in a smooth  and  uncon-  
s t ra ined  way  to exact ly  p roduce  those  f rag-  
mentary  u t te rances  wh ich  have  the des i red  
f i xed  syntact i c  s t ruc ture .  
II. CONSISTENCY CONSTRAINTS 
Cons is tency  const ra in ts  to be used  as a 
bas is  for  d iagnos ing  s tudents '  fau l t s  are 
expressed  in a qu i te  common way  as b inary  
pred icates  wh ich  ho ld  over  s t ruc tured  feature  
sets  of syntact i ca l ly  re la ted  word  fo rms 
(source  and dest inat ion) .  Feature  sets, as 
usual ,  are a t tached to word  fo rms via the 
d ic t ionary  or a morpho log ica l  ana lys i s .  To 
spec i fy  the par t  of a feature  set re levant  
to a spec i f i c  cor rec tness  cond i t ion  cor rec t -  
ness  pred icates  are augmented  by a th i rd  
a rgument ,  a category :  
agree \ [<souree>,<dest inat ion>,<eategory>\ ] .  
S imple  examples  of cor rec tness  pred icates  
de f ine  symmetr ica l  re la t ions  between equ iva -  
lent  par ts  of the two invo lved  feature  sets, 
as does  the number  agreement  between the 
determiner  and  the govern ing  noun in a German 
noun phrase:  
agree(det ,  noun, number \ ] .  
Other  pred icates  are needed to account  for  
agreement  between d i f fe rent  par ts  of two 
feature  sets. One example  are se lec t iona l  
demands  of a source  to be matched w i th  the 
cor respond ing  proper t ies  of a dest inat ion ,  
another  is g iven  by pred icates  cop ing  w i th  
the d i s t inc t ion  between e.g. d i f fe rent  gender  
va lues  be long ing  to s tem or end ing  of German 
possess ive  pronouns .  
A bas ica l ly  d i f fe rent  type of p red icates  
does  not spec i fy  a source  but ins tead  g ives  a 
cond i t ion  to be fu l f i l l ed  by the dest inat ion :  
sat i s fy \ [  <dest inat ion>,  <cond i t ion>\ ] .  
Th is  type  is a lways  used  in one of the 
fo l low ing  eases: 
(I) Cond i t ions  of pure  s t ruc tura l  o r ig in  so  
that  no par t i cu la r  source  can  be given,  e.g. 
the nominat ive  of the subject :  
sa t i s fy \ [  noun-o f - sub jec t ,  ease=nora). 
(2) Case  government  of verbs,  e.g. : 
sa t i s fy \ [  noun-o f -dat ive -ob jec t ,  ease=dat \ ] .  
(3) Ord inary '  agreement  re la t ions  where,  
because  of the l im i ts  of a spec i f i c  exerc i se ,  
it is not necessary  or not poss ib le  to spec i -  
fy  the source  of the cond i t ion  exp l i c i t l y  
(cut -o f f  a res  in the const ra in t  network) .  
(4) Word  c lass  res t r i c t ions ,  e.g. a noun 
phrase  determiner  can be an ar t i c le  as wel l  
as a possess ive  or demonst ra t ive  pronoun:  
415 
sat is fy \ [det ,  oat=(art ,  poss-p, dem-p)\].  
To ach ieve a Un i fo rm treatment,  in terna l ly  
the sat i s fy -pred icates  are conver ted  into 
o rd inary  agreement -pred icates  between an 
ar t i f i c ia l l y  c reated  feature express ion  at a 
nowhere  source ( ind icated  by ***\] and the 
des i red  dest inat ion:  
satisfy\[  noun, case=ace\]  
==> 
agree\[ ***, noun, ease\] . 
A s ing le  t ra in ing  exerc ise  usua l ly  is de- 
sc r ibed  by a number of cor rectness  pred icates  
which can be combined to fo rm a s imple  con- 
s t ra int  network. The arcs in this network  
represent  cor rectness  pred icates  and the 
connected  nodes ape ident i f ied  by the source 
and dest inat ion  arguments.  A rather  s imple 
type exerc ise  is, for example, the correct  
inser t ion  of a German possess ive  pronoun into 
a care fu l ly  generated  context  like: 
" lob habe Schal  und Mutze verloren. 
Hat jemand ... Sachen gesehen?"  
The exerc ise  asks the student  to have regard  
to the agreement  of the pronoun with both, 
the subsequent  noun ("Sachen")  and the corre-  
spond ing  antecedent  ("Ich"\].  It resu l ts  in a 
const ra in t  network  cons is t ing  of three nodes 
and nine arcs. Two of the nodes (antece-  
dent and noun\] are assoc ia ted  with the con- 
text whereas  ~the th i rd  (possess ive\ ]  repre-  
sents the s tudent ' s  response. The network  is 
equ iva lent  to the fo l low ing  l ist of cor rect -  
ness predicates:  
satisfy\[ possess ive,  cat=pose-p\ ]  
satisfy\[ noun, cat=noun\]  
satisfy\[ antecedent,  cat=( noun, peps-p\] \] 
agree\[ antecedent ,  possess ive,  s tem-number\ ]  
agree\[ antecedent ,  possess ive,  s tem-gender \ ]  
agree\[ antecedent ,  possess ive,  s tem-person\ ]  
agree\[ noun, possess ive,  case\] 
agree\[ noun, possess ive,  number\] 
agree\[ noun, possess ive,  gender\]. 
As a s l ight ly  more ambi t ious  example  
serve the fo rmat ion  of a German local  
accord ing  to the f ixed s t ructura l  pat tern  
may 
PP~ 
(p repos i t ion  determiner  ad jec t ive  noun\] 
to be inser ted  into sentences  l ike 
"Des Gold habe ich ... gelegt ."  
This t ime the network  cons is ts  of f ive nodes 
and 16 edges. All the nodes cor respond to 
word forms in the s tudent ' s  response, but 
depend ing  on the sentence  context  on ly  a 
subset  of exaet ly  four nodes (e.g. (prep-4 
dot adj noun\]\] is ins tant ia ted  to the 
incoming  word forms: 
satisfy\[  prep-3, cat=prep\]  
satisfy\[  prep-3, se lec t= locat ion \ ]  
satisfy\[  prep-4, cat=prep\]  
satisfy\[  prep-4, se lec t=d i rect ion \ ]  
416 
satisfy\[ noun, cat=noun\]  
satisfy\[ det, cat=( art, pose-p, des-p\]\] 
satisfy\[ adj,  oat=adj \ ]  
agree\[ prep-3, noun, ease\] 
agree\[ prep-4, noun, ease\] 
agree\[ noun, dot, case\] 
agree\[ noun, dot, number\] 
agree\[ noun, dot, gender\] 
agree\[ noun, adj, case\] 
agree\[ noun, adj, number\] 
agree\[ noun, adj, gender\] 
agree\[ det, adj, in f lec t iona l -degree \ ] .  
III. D IAGNOSIS  
D iagnos is  is ma in ly  based on const ra in t  
p ropagat ion  techniques.  The nodes in the 
const ra in t  network  are t reated  as var iab les  
which rece ive  their  values ( feature  sets) by 
means of a pat tern  match ing  procedure  on the 
s tudent ' s  input. 
The procedure  cons is ts  of four parts be ing 
invoked sequent ia l ly .  Two of them (the hard 
core of d iagnosis \ ]  are in tended to detect and 
- if des i red  to locate errors  in the 
s tudent ' s  response. The other  two ref ine 
d iagnost i c  resu l ts  by app ly ing  t rans forma-  
t ional  ru les and pre ference  c r i te r ia  in order 
to prov ide  a sound basis  for th@ generat ion  
of appropr ia te  explanat ions.  
The reason to draw a c lear  d i s t inc t ion  
between the error  detect ion  and loca l i za t ion  
components  is one of mere techn ica l  nature. 
The separat ion  has been in t roduced to cons id -  
e rab ly  speed up the hand l ing  of e r ror - f ree  
utterances,  s ince it a l lows the t ime expen-  
sive loca l i za t ion  procedure  to be act ivated  
on ly  if indeed an error  ocur red  and the 
s tudent  ac tua l ly  did ask for an exp lanat ion  
of his mistake. 
(A\] error  detect ion  
Error  detect ion,  in fact, is a d i rect  
proof  p rocedure  for the cor rectness  of the 
utterance. T ry ing  to show the absence of 
errors, it eva luates  the re levant  pred icates  
of the const ra in t  network, tak ing  into con- 
s iderat ion  all the morpho-syntact i c  read ings  
of the word forms concerned. The values of 
the network  var iab les  ape constant ly  updated 
accord ing  to the resu l ts  of an ord inary  fea- 
ture set un i f i ca t ion  unti l  f ina l ly  a state is 
reached which sat i f ies  all re levant  pred i -  
cates s imul taneous ly .  
G iven the ease this proof  cannot  be estab-  
l ished, one or poss ib ly  severa l  mis takes  of: 
the s tudent  have to be assumed and upon 
request  a deta i led  ana lys i s  of the error  
reasons  may become necessary.  
( B\] error  loca l i za t ion  
Error  loca l i za t ion  is car r ied  out by a 
s imulat ion  of const ra in t  v io lat ions.  For 
e a c h pred icate  in the network  the proce-  
dure  fol:Lows up the consequences  of assuming  
the s tudent  d id  ignore  the ex is tence  of 
exact ly  th is  par t i cu la r  regu lar i ty .  Th is  
assumpt ion  is mode l led  by temporar i l y  add ing  
the negated  pred icate  to the knowledge base  
and  fo l low ing  up i ts  consequences  around the 
network .  Theoret i ca l ly  such  a mod i f i ca t ion  of 
the knowledge base  is equ iva lent  to reason ing  
based  on Re(tar '  s famous  "c losed  wor ld  as-  
sumpt ion"  (Re( tar ,  1978): I f  you  cannot  proo f  
P, add not(P)  to the set of p remises .  
By add ing  it as a premise  the d iagnos is  
p rocedur~ t reats  a negated  pred icate  as no- 
th ing  more  than  mere ly  an er ror  hypothes is .  
It can  be ra i sed  to the leve l  of a conf i rmed 
er ror  descr ip t ion  on ly  a f te r  i ts  consequences  
for  othc~r pred icates  in the network  have 
care fu l ly  been  invest igated  and proper ly  
recorded .  In cont ras t  to a typ ica l  shor t -cut  
so lu t ion  or a heur i s t i cs -based  approach  the 
d iagnos i~ procedure  thus  car r ies  out a 
thorough ana lys i s  of a l l  poss ib le  e r ror  hypo-  
theses.  Hence,  it is par t i cu la r ly  qua l i f i ed  
to d iagnose  mul t ip le  fau l t s  as wel l  as e r rors  
w i th  an ambiguous  in terpretat ion .  
Techn ica l ly  th is  k ind  of reason ing  is 
ach ieved  by s imply  resuming  er ror  detect ion  
w i th  jus t  the log ica l  complement  of the usua l  
feature  un i f i ca t ion  resu l ts ?  E r ro r  detect ion  
prov ides  for  th is  purpose  and co l lec ts  al l  
necessary  data  on a separate  stack. 
Desp i te  the rather' t iny  s i ze  of  a typ ica l  
const ra in t  network ,  the s imula t ion  of con-  
s t ra in t  v io la t ions  resu l t s  in a procedure  of 
h igh  complex i ty  and e f fec t ive  measures  are 
requ i red  to keep  the s ize  of the search  space  
l imi ted ?  Hence,  in a w ide ly  accepted  way  
er ror  loca l i za t ion  is res t r i c ted  to the 
search  of min ima l  d iagnoses  ( that  is, resu l t s  
inc lud ing  on ly  a min imum number  of const ra in t  
v io la t ion  hypotheses) ?  
(C) e r ror  t rans format ion  
Accord ing  to the fundamenta l  d i s t inc t ion  
between ru les  and fac ts  in a knowledge base  
two d i f fe rent  types  of misconcept ions  have to 
be d i s t ingu ished  in the d iagnost i c  resu l ts :  
(a) ru le  v io la t ions :  the ignorance  of cor -  
rec tness  cond i t ions  ( expressed  by pred icates  
Jn the network)  and 
(b) faetua l  faults :  the lack  of knowledge 
about  spec i f i c  morpho~syntact i c  p roper t ies  of 
a word  fo rm (expressed  by a feature  set in 
the d ic t ionary .  
An in tegrat ion  of both  types  of misconcep-  
t ions  in to  a s ing le  d iagnos ing  procedure  
ne i ther  y ie lds  an e f f i c ient  so lu t ion  nor  
tu rns  out to be rea l ly  necessary .  In p r in t ( -  
. ple, ru le  v io la t ions  and fac tua l  fau l t s  re-  
pr'esent d i f fe rent  v iews  on one and the same 
phenomenon and .a par t i cu la r  e r ror  can  equa l ly  
wel l  he exp la ined  in te rms of ru les  or in 
te rms of facts. Both  types  shou ld  be conver t -  
ib le  in to  each  o ther  w i thout  much d i f f i cu l ty .  
Accord ing ly ,  e r ror  loca l i za t ion  has been  
des igned to exc lus ive ly  concent ra te  on the 
ana lys i s  of ru le  v io la t ions  and to leave  open 
the prob lem of  fac tua l  faul ts .  A to ta l  igno-  
rance  of fac tua l  fau l ts ,  of course ,  wou ld  be 
an in to le rab le  res t r i c t ion  on the d iagnost i c  
capab i l i t i es  of the system,  s ince  then  it 
in terprets  e r rors  of whatever  k ind  in te rms 
of ru le  v io la t ions  only. 
Hence,  a t rans format iona l  component  has 
been  added wh ich  is ab le  to in fe r  fac tua l  
fau l t s  f rom the h i ther to  obta ined  d iagnost i c  
resu l ts .  The necessary  in fo rmat ion  is usua l ly  
conta ined  in typ ica l  s t ruc tura l  e r ro r  conf ig -  
u ra t ions  invo lv ing  the v io la t ion  of ad jo in ing

can be t rans formed in to  a fac tua l  fau l t

Under  these  c i rcumstances  Y is sa id  to be

of genera l i ty  a new descr ip t ion  can be gener -

types  of s t ruc tura l  conf igurat ions  have to be 
d i s t ingu ished:  
(I) A s ing le  const ra in t  v io la t ion  concern ing  
two i so la ted  nodes  X and Y can be t rans formed 
in to  two  a l te rnat ive  fac tua \ ]  e r ror

not\[ agree\[  X, Y, C\] \] ==> not\[ agree{ ***, Y, C\] \] . 
(3) Severa l  const ra in t  v io la t ions  for an

fac tua l  e r ror  descr ip t ion  (c. f. the genera l

The dec is ion  whether  to app ly  a t rans forma-

the to le rab le  complex i ty  of d iagnost i c  
resu l t s  {it  is ra i sed  by (I), ma inta ined  by 
{ 2) and reduced by (3)) and the in tended 
teaeh ing  s t ra tegy  (e. f. sec t ion  IV). 
(4) e r ror  genera l i za t ion  
Er ror  genera l i za t ion  a ims at an as h igh  as 
poss ib le  aggregat ion  of e lementary  er rors  
(const ra in t  v io la t ions  or fac tua l  fau l ts )  
in to  a more  conc ise  descr ip t ion .  Genera l i za -  
t ion  schemata  can  be de f ined  for  al l  th ree  
argument  pos i t ions  of a v io la ted  cor rectness  
pred ieate~ e.g. for  a category  genera l i za -  
tion: 
and{ not\[ agree \ [X~ Y, CI\]\]~ 
not{ agree \ [X ,Y ,  C2\]\] \ ]  
==> 
not \ [agree \ [X ,Y , (C1 ,C2) \ ] \ ]  
wh ich  for  the purpose  of exp lanat ion  la ter  
might  be paraphrased  l ike  
"M iss ing  CI and C2 agreement  between X 
and Y." 
Other  ~enera l i za t ion  ru les  are in tended to 
co l lapse  a l te rnat ive  d iagnost i c  read ings  
wh ich  mere ly  are artJ fi~et~ resu l t ing  f rom the 
techn ica l  layout  of d ic t ionary  ent r ies .  
Bes ides  these  s t r ingent  genera l i za t ion  
schemes  somet imes  very  weak  ones  turn  out to 
be use fu l  as well. They  are par t ieu la r ly  
su i ted  to generate  an at leas t  par t ia l l y  
comprehens ib le  exp lanat ion  wh ich  in an opaque 
er ror  s i tuat ion  may g ive  a rough ind icat ion  
of the er ror  locat ion  ins tead  of annoy ing  the 
s tudent  w i th  p lenty  of deta i l :

\[ not{ agree{ X2, Y, C2\] \ ] \ ]  
==> 
not{ agreeE**x ,Y , (C1~C2) \ ] \ ] .  
The resu l t  of a weak  genera l i za t ion  then  may 
be exp la ined  to the s tudent  perhaps  in a 
sentence  like: 
"There  is someth ing  wrong w i th  CI 
and C2 at Y." 
S ince  it is log ica l ly  incomplete ,  however ,  a 
weak  genera l i za t ion  can  no longer  serve  as a 
re l iab le  bas i s  to der ive  repa i r  suggest ions  
from, ne i ther  for  in terna l  use nor  for  a 
presentat ion  to the s tudent .

There  is some reason  to assume the genera l  
four  s tep  scheme of d iagnos is  not be ing  
res t r i c ted  to v io la t ions  of cons is tency  con-  
s t ra in ts ,  but  ra ther  be ing  adaptab le  to o ther  
types  of er rors ,  namely  s t ruc tura l  ones, as 
well. Again,  the procedure  has to be based  on 
a detect ion  and proper  loca l i za t ion  of e le -  
mentary  er ror  types  w i th  respect  to a s imp le  
mode l  of cor rec tness ,  e.g. a recurs ion - f ree  
PSG. In th is  context  the e lementary  er ror  
types  are subst i tu t ion ,  inser t ion  and omis -  
s ion  of s ing le  word  forms. Other  types  (e.g. 
ext rapos i t ion  or mutua l  in terchange of forms)  
can la ter  be in fe r red  f rom the pr imary  
resu l t s  by  means  of t rans format ion  rules.  
Genera l i za t ion  f ina l ly  a l lows  to condense  
er ror  descr ip t ions  in to  more  complex  
s t ruc tura l  un i t s  (e.g. const i tuent  based  
er rors ) .  
IV. ERROR SELECT ION 
Er ror  se lec t ion  is an in tegra l  par t  of 
severa l  s teps  of the d iagnos is  p rocedure .  It 
t r ies  to keep  the number  of concur rent  e r ror  
descr ip t ions  as smal l  as poss ib le .  E r ror  
loca l i za t ion  se lec ts  on the number  of p r imary  
er rors  per  e r ror  descr ip t ion ,  but  s ince  
t rans format ion  as wel l  as genera l i za t ion  can  
in f luence  the resu l t ing  complex i ty ,  the i r  
resu l t s  in tu rn  are sub jec t  to a dec is ion  
w i th  regard  to a min ima l  number  of errors .  
A l though the s ide  e f fec t  of fu r ther  re-  
duc ing  the complex i ty  of min ima l  d iagnoses  is 
normal ly  we lcomed,  e r ror  t rans format ions  have  
to be sens i t ive  to the in tended teach ing  
s t ra tegy .  D iagnos ing  a const ra in t  v io la t ion  
exact ly  p inpo in ts  the conceptua l  mis take  of 
the s tudent  but  does  not a lways  g ive  use fu l  
h in ts  about  where  to cor rec t  the u t terance .  
In these  cases,  desp i te  be ing  more  complex ,  
an ind icat ion  of fac tua l  fau l t s  may somet imes  
be more  he lp fu l ,  s ince  it bet ter  po in ts  out  
the ex is t ing  poss ib i l i t i es  for  an improvement  
o~ the par t ia l l y  wrong so lu t ion .  
On the o ther  hand, even  less  complex  
fac tua l  fau l t s  may be qu i te  undes i red  if they  
resu l t  in doubt fu l  cor rec t ion  proposa ls  (e.g. 
in a g iven  semant ic  context  a gender -o f - the -  
noun er ror  can  hard ly  be repa i red  by  s imply  
exchang ing  the noun in quest ion) .  
Desp i te  the se lec t ion  of min ima l  d iagnoses  
on severa l  leve ls ,  somet imes  the d iagnos ing  
component  prov ides  a number  of a l te rnat ive  
min imal  d iagnoses .  They  f ina l ly  are eva luated  
and we ighted  accord i "g  to a number  of p re fer -  
ence  c r i te r ia :  
(a) a s t ruc tura l  measure  wh ich  depend ing  on 
whether  a conceptua l  descr ip t ion  or a repa i r  
suggest ion  is p re fer red  may se lec t  e r rors  
h igher  up or deeper  down in a h ie rarch ica l  
syntact i c  representat ion  of the u t terance ,  
(b) the degree  to wh ich  an er ror  exp lanat ion  
can  be assumed to be he lp fu l  for  the s tudent  
( i f  poss ib le ,  cer ta i ,  types  of exp lanat ions  
are suppressed) ,  
(c) h ints ,  resu l t ing  f rom an obst inate  repe-  
t i t ion  of one and the same er ror  type. 
V. CONCLUSIONS
