Abstract 
Near-perfect automatic accent assignment is at- 
tainable for citation-style speech, but better com- 
putational models are needed to predict accent 
in extended, spontaneous discourses. This paper 
presents an empirically motivated theory of the dis- 
course focusing nature of accent in spontaneous 
speech. Hypotheses based on this theory lead to a 
new approach to accent prediction, in which pat- 
terns of deviation from citation form accentuation, 
defined at the constituent or noun phrase level, 
are atttomatically earned from an annotated cor- 
pus. Machine learning experiments on 1031 noun 
phrases from eighteen spontaneous direction-giving 
monologues how that accent assignment can be 
significantly improved by up to 4%-6% relative to 
a hypothetical baseline system that wotdd produce 
only citation-form accentuation, giving error rate 
reductions of 11%-25%. 
1 Introduction 
In speech synthesis systems, near-perfect (98%) ac- 
cent assignment is automatically attainable for read- 
aloud, citation-style speech (Hirschberg, 1993). But 
for unrestricted, extended spontaneous discourses, 
highly natural accentuation is often achieved only 
by costly human post-editing. A better understand- 
ing of the effects of discourse context on accentual 
variation is needed not only to fully model this fun- 
damental prosodic feature for text-to-speech (TTS) 
synthesis systems, but also to further the integration 
of prosody into speech understanding and concept- 
to-speech (CTS) synthesis ystems at the appropri- 
ate level of linguistic representation. 
This paper presents an empirically motivated the- 
ory of the discourse focusing function of accent. 
The theory describes for the first time the interacting 
contributions to accent prediction made by factors 
related to the local and global attentional status of 
discourse referents in a discourse model (Grosz and 
Sidner, 1986). The ability of the focusing features 
to predict accent for a blind test corpus is examined 
using machine learning. Because attentional status 
is a property of referring expressions, a novel ap- 
proach to accent prediction is proposed to allow for 
the integration of word-based and constituent-based 
linguistic features in the models to be learned. 
The task of accent assignment is redefined as 
the prediction of patterns of deviation from citation 
form accentuation. Crucially, these deviations are 
captured at the constituent level. This task redefi- 
nition has two novel properties: (1) it bootstraps di- 
rectly on knowledge about citation form or so-called 
"context-independent" prosody embodied in current 
TTS technology; and (2) the abstraction from word 
to constituent allows for the natural integration of 
focusing features into the prediction methods. 
Results of the constituent-based accent prediction 
experiments show that for two speakers from a cor- 
pus of spontaneous direction-giving monologues, 
accent assignment can be improved by up to 4%-6% 
relative to a hypothetical baseline system that would 
produce only citation-form accentuation, giving er- 
ror rate reductions of 11%-25%. 
2 Accent and attention 
Much theoretical work on intonational meaning has 
focused on the association of accent with NEW in- 
formation, and lack of accent with GIVEN informa- 
tion, where given and new are defined with respect 
to whether or not the information is already repre- 
sented in a discourse model. While this association 
reflects a general tendency (Brown, 1983), empir- 
ical studies on longer discourses have shown this 
simple dichotomy cannot explain important sub- 
classes of expressions, uch as accented pronouns, 
cf. (Terken, 1984; Hirschberg, 1993). 
We propose a new theory of the relationship be- 
tween accent and attention, based on an enriched 
taxonomy of given/new information status provided 
by both the LOCAL (centering) and GLOBAL (fo- 
cus stack model) attentional state models in Grosz 
and Sidner's discourse modeling theory (1986).

Analysis of a 20-minute spontaneous story-telling 
monologue t identified separate but interacting con- 
tributions of grammatical function, form of refer- 
ring expression and accentuation 2 in conveying the 
attentional status of a discourse referent. These in- 
teractions can be formally expressed in the frame- 
work of attentional modeling by the following prin- 
ciples of interpretation: 
? The LEXICAL FORM OF A REFERRING EXPRES- 
SION indicates the level of attentional processing, 
i.e., pronouns involve local focusing while full lex- 
ical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al, 
1995). 
? The GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION of a referring ex- 
pression reflects the local attentional status of the 
referent, i.e., subject position generally holds the 
highest ranking member of the forward-looking 
centers list (Cf list), while direct object holds the 
next highest ranking member of the Cf list (Grosz 
et al, 1995; Kameyama, 1985). 
? The ACCENTING of a referring expression serves 
as an inference cue to shift attention to a new 
backward-looking center (Cb), or to mark the 
global (re)introduction f a referent; LACK OF AC- 
CENT serves as an inference cue to maintain atten- 
tional focus on the Cb, Cf list members or global 
referents (Nakatani, 1997). 
The third principle concerning accent interpreta- 
tion defines for the first time how accent serves uni- 
formly to shift attention and lack of accent serves to 
maintain attention, at either the local or global level 
of discourse structure. This principle describing the 
discourse focusing functions of accent directly ex- 
plains 86.5% (173/200) of the referring expressions 
in the spontaneous narrative, as shown in Table 1. If 
performance factors (e.g. repairs, interruptions) and 
special discourse situations (e.g. direct quotations) 
are also considered accounted for, then coverage in- 
creases to 96.5% (193/200). 
3 Constituent-based experiments 
To test the generality of the proposed account of ac- 
cent and attention, the ability of local and global fo- 
cusing features to predict accent for a blind corpus 
is examined using machine learning. To rigorously 
assess the potential gains to be had from these at- 
tentional features, we consider them in combination 
with lexical and syntactic features identified in the 
literature as strong predictors of accentuation (AI- 
tenberg, 1987; Hirschberg, 1993; Ross et al, 1992).

Previous studies, nonetheless, were aimed at pre- 
dicting word accentuation, and so the features we 
borrow are being tested for the first time in learning 
the abstract accentuation patterns of syntactic on- 
stituents, specifically noun phrases (NPs). 
3.1 Methods 
Accent prediction models are learned from a cor- 
pus of unrestricted, spontaneous direction-giving 
monologues from the Boston Directions Corpus 
(Nakatani et al, 1995). Eighteen spontaneous 
direction-giving monologues are analyzed from two 
American English speakers, H1 (male) and H3 (fe- 
male). The monologues range from 43 to 631 words 
in length, and comprise 1031 referring expressions 
made up of 2020 words. Minimal, non-recursive

classification systems from a training corpus of cor- 
rectly classified examples, each defined by a vector 
of feature values, or predictors. 3 
3.2 Citation-based Accent Classification 
The accentuation of baseNPs is coded according to 
the relationship of the actual accenting (i.e. ac- 
cented versus unaccented) on the words in the 
baseNP to the accenting predicted by a TTS system 
that received each sentence in the corpus in isola- 
tion. The actual accenting is determined by prosodic 
labeling using the ToBI standard (Pitrelli et al, 
1994). Word accent predictions are produced by the 
Bell Laboratories NewTTS system (Sproat, 1997). 
NewTTS incorporates complex nominal accenting 
rules (Sproat, 1994) as well as general, word-based 
accenting rules (Hirschberg, 1993). It is assumed 
ZRipper is similar to CART (Breiman et al, 1984), but it 
directly produces IF-THEN logic rules instead of decision trees 
and also utilizes incremental error eduction techniques incom- 
bination with novel rule optimization strategies. 
for the purposes of this study that NewTTS gener- 
ally assigns citation-style accentuation when passed 
sentences in isolation. 
For each baseNP, one of the following four ac- 
centing patterns is assigned: 
? CITATION FORM: exact match between actual and 
"ITS-assigned word accenting. 
? SUPRA: one or more accented words are predicted 
unaccented by TFS; otherwise, "ITS predictions 
match actual accenting. 
? REDUCED: one or more unaccented words are pre- 
dicted accented by TTS; otherwise, "FrS predic- 
tions match actual accenting. 
? SHIFT: at least one accented word is predicted un- 
accented by "ITS, and at least one unaccented word 
is predicted accented by "ITS. 
Examples from the Boston Directions Corpus for 
each accent class appear in Table 3.

speech, in these unrestricted, spontaneous mono- 
logues, 30% of referring expressions do not bear 
citation form accentuation. The citation form ac- 
cent percentages serve as the baseline for the accent 
prediction experiments; correct classification rates 
above 75.8% and 60.2% for H1 and H3 respectively 
would represent performance above and beyond the 
941 
state-of-the-art citation form accentuation models, 
gained by direct modeling of cases of supra, reduced 
or shifted constituent-based accentuation. 
3.3 Predictors 
3.3.1 Lexical features 
The use of set features, which are handled by Rip- 
per, extends lexical word features to the constituent 
level. Two set-valued features, BROAD CLASS SE- 
QUENCE and LEMMA SEQUENCE, represent lexical 
information. These features consist of an ordered 
list of the broad class part-of-speech (POS) tags or 
word lemmas for the words making up the baseNP. 
For example, the lemma sequence for the NP, the 
Harvard Square T stop, is {the, Harvard, Square, T, 
stop}. The corresponding broad class sequence is 
{determiner, noun, noun, noun, noun}. Broad class 
tags are derived using Brill's (1995) part-of-speech 
tagger, and word lemma information is produced by 
NewTTS (Sproat, 1997). 
POS information is used to assign accenting in 
nearly all speech synthesis ystems. Initial word- 
based experiments on our corpus showed that broad 
class categories performed slightly better than both 
the function-content distinction and the POS tags 
themselves, giving 69%-81% correct word predic- 
tions (Nakatani, 1997). 
3.3.2 Syntactic constituency features 
The CLAUSE TYPE feature represents global syn- 
tactic constituency information, while the BASENP 
TYPE feature represents local or NP-internal syntac- 
tic constituency information. Four clause types are 
coded: matrix, subordinate, predicate complement 
and relative. Each baseNP is semi-automatically as-
signed the clause type of the lowest level clause or 
nearest dominating clausal node in the parse tree, 
which contains the baseNP. As for baseNP types, 
the baseNP type of baseNPs not dominated by any 
NP node is SIMPLE-BASENP. BaseNPs that occur 
in complex NPs (and are thus dominated by at least 
one NP node) are labeled according to whether the 
baseNP contains the head word for the dominating 
NP. Those that are dominated by only one NP node 
and contain the head word for the dominating NP 
are HEAD-BASENPS; all other NPs in a complex NP 
are CHILD-BASENPS. Conjoined noun phrases in- 
volve additional categories of baseNPs that are col- 
lapsed into the CONJUNCT-BASENP category. Ta- 
ble 5 gives the distributions of baseNP types. 
Focus projection theories of accent, e.g. (Gussen- 
hoven, 1984; Selkirk, 1984), would predict a large 
baseNP type H1

role for syntactic onstituency information in de- 
termining accent, especially for noun phrase con- 
stituents. Empirical evidence for such a role, how- 
ever, has been weak (Altenberg, 1987). 
3.3.3 Local focusing features 
The local attentional status of baseNPs is repre- 
sented by two features commonly used in centering 
theory to compute the Cb and the Cf list, GRAM- 
MATICAL FUNCTION and FORM OF EXPRESSION 
(Grosz et al, 1995). Hand-labeled grammatical 
functions include sttbject, direct object, indirect ob- 
ject, predicate complement, adfimct. Form of ex- 
pression feature values are .adverbial noun, cardi- 
nal, definite NP, demonstrative NP, indefinite NP, 
pronoun, proper name, quantifier NP, verbal noun, 
etc. 
3.3.4 Global focus feature 
The global focusing status of baseNPs is computed 
using two sets of analyses: discourse segmenta- 
tions and coreference coding. Expert discourse 
structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS 
SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse bound- 
aries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon 
(Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). The consensus 
labels for segment-initial boundaries provide a lin- 
ear segmentation of a discourse into discourse seg- 
ments. Coreferential relations are coded by two la- 
belers using DTT (Discourse Tagging Tool) (Aone 
and Bennett, 1995). To compute coreference chains, 
only the relation of strict coference is used. Two 
NPs, npl and np2, are in a strict coreference rela- 
tionship, when np2 occurs after npl in the discourse 
and realizes the same discourse ntity that is real- 
ized by npl. Reference chains are then automat- 
ically computed by linking noun phrases in strict 
coference relations into the longest possible chains. 
Given a consensus linear segmentation a d refer- 
ence chains, global focusing status is determined. 
For each baseNP, if it does not occur in a refer- 
ence chain, and thus is realized only once in the dis- 
942 
course, it is assigned the SINGLE-MENTION focus- 
ing status. The remaining statuses apply to baseNPs 
that do occur in reference chains. If a baseNP in a 
chain is not previously mentioned in the discourse, 
it is assigned the FIRST-MENTION status. If its most 
recent coreferring expression occurs in the current 
segment, the baseNP is in IMMEDIATE fOCUS; if it 
occurs in the immediately previous segment, the 
baseNP is in NEIGHBORING fOCUS; if it occurs in 
the discourse but not in either the current or imme- 
diately previous segments, then the baseNP is as- 
signed STACK focus.

sification, e.g. 2.7% and 2.3% for H1 using broad

together, and (3) local focus and lexical features 
combined. Table 8 shows the accent class distribu-

reveals that there are few non-lexical rules learned. 
The exception seems to be the rule that adverbial 
noun phrases belong to the supra accent class. How- 
ever, new interactions of local focusing features 
(grammatical function and form of expression) with 
lexical information are discovered by Ripper. It also 
appears that as suggested by earlier experiments,

5 Conc lus ion  
Accent prediction experiments on noun phrase con- 
stituents demonstrated that deviations from citation 
form accentuation (supra, reduced and shift classes) 
can be directly modeled. Machine learning experi- 
ments using not only lexical and syntactic features, 
but also discourse focusing features identified by 
a new theory of accent interpretation i  discourse, 
showed that accent assignment can be improved by 
up to 4%-6% relative to a hypothetical baseline sys- 
tem that would produce only citation-form accen- 
tuation, giving error rate reductions of 11%-25%. 
In general, constituent-based accentuation is most 
accurately learned from lexical information readily 
available in TTS systems. For CTS systems, com- 
parable performance may be achieved using only 
higher level attentional features. There are several 
other lessons to be learned, conceming individual 
speaker, domain dependent and domain indepen- 
dent effects on accent modeling. 
First, it is perhaps counterintuitively harder to 
predict deviations from citation form accentuation 
for speakers who exhibit a great deal of non- 
citation-style accenting behavior, such as speaker 
H3. Accent prediction results for H1 exceeded those 
for H3, although about 15% more of H3's tokens 
exhibited non-citation form accentuation. Finding 
the appropriate parameters by which to describe the 
prosody of individual speakers i  an important goal 
that can be advanced by using machine learning 
techniques toexplore large spaces of hypotheses. 
Second, it is evident from the strong performance 
of the word lemma sequence models that deviations 
from citation-form accentuation may often be ex- 
pressed by lexicalized rules of some sort. Lexical- 
ized rules in fact have proven useful in other areas of 
natural language statistical modeling, such as POS 
tagging (Brill, 1995) and parsing (Collins, 1996). 
The specific lexicalized rules learned for many of 
the models would not have followed from any the- 
oretical or empirical proposals in the literature. It 
may be that domain dependent training using au- 
944 
tomatic learning is the appropriate way to develop 
practical models of accenting patterns on different 
corpora. And especially for different speakers in the 
same domain, automatic learning methods eem to 
be the only efficient way to capture perhaps idiolec- 
tical variation in accenting. 
Finally, it should be noted that notwithstanding 
individual speaker and domain dependent effects, 
domain independent factors identified by the new 
theory of accent and attention do contribute to ex- 
perimental performance. The two local focusing 
features, grammatical function and form of refer- 
ring expression, enable improvements above the 
citation-form baseline, especially in combination 
with lexical information. Global focusing informa- 
tion is of limited use by itself, but as may have 
been hypothesized, contributes to accent prediction 
in combination with local focus, lexical and syntac- 
tic features.
