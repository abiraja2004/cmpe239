Abstract 
When aligning texts in very different languages such 
as Korean and English, structural features beyond 
word or phrase give useful intbrmation. In this pa- 
per, we present a method for selecting struetm'al 
features of two languages, from which we construct 
a model that assigns the conditional probabilities 
to corresponding tag sequences in bilingual English- 
Korean corpora. For tag sequence mapl)ing 1)etween 
two langauges, we first, define a structural feature 
fllnction which represents tatistical prol)erties of 
elnpirical distribution of a set of training samples. 
The system, based on maximmn entrol)y coneet)t, se- 
le(:ts only ti;atures that pro(luee high increases in log- 
likelihood of training salnl)les. These structurally 
mat)ped features are more informative knowledge for 
statistical machine translation t)etween English and 
Korean. Also, the inforum.tion can help to reduce the 
1)arameter sl)ace of statisti('al alignment 1)y eliminat- 
ing synta(:tically uiflikely alignmenls. 
1 Introduction 
Aligned texts have been used for derivation of 1)ilin- 
gual dictioimries and terminoh)gy databases which 
are useflfl for nlachine translation and cross lan- 
guages infornmtion retriewfl. Thus, a lot of align- 
ment techniques have been suggested at; the sen- 
tence (Gale et al, 1993), phrase (Shin et al, 1996), 
nomt t)hrase (Kupiec, 1993), word (Brown et al, 
1993; Berger et al, 1996; Melamed, 1997), collo- 
cation (Smadja et al, 1996) and terminology level. 
Seine work has used lexical association measures 
for word alignments. However, the association mea- 
sures could be misled since a word in a source lan- 
guage frequently co-occurs with more titan one word 
in a target language. In other work, iterative re- 
estimation techniques have beets emt)loyed. They 
were usually incorporated with the EM algorithm 
mid dynmnic progranmfing. In that case, the prob- 
al)ilities of aligmnents usually served as 1)arameters 
in a model of statistical machine translation. 
In statistical machine translation, IBM 1~5 mod- 
els (Brown et al, 1993) based on the source-chmmel 
model have been widely used and revised for many 
language donmins and applications. It has also 
shortconfing that it needs much iteration time for 
parameter estimation and high decoding complex- 
ity, however. 
Much work has been done to overcome the prob- 
lem. Wu (1996) adopted chammls that eliminate 
syntactically unlikely alignments and Wang et al 
(1998) presented a model based on structures of two 
la.nguages. Tilhnann et al (1997) suggested the 
dynanfie programming lmsed search to select the 
best alignment and preprocessed bilingual texts to 
remove word order differences. Sate et al (1998) 
and Och et al (1998) proposed a model for learn- 
ing translation rules with morphological information 
mid word category in order to improve statistical 
translation. 
Furthemlore, llla,lly researches assullle(t Olle-to- 
one correspondence due to the coml)lexity and com- 
Imtati(m time of statistical aliglunents. Although 
this assumption Ire'ned out t;o 1)e useful for align- 
ment of close lallguages uch as English and French, 
it is not, applicabh~ to very different languages, in 
particular, Korean and English where there is rarely 
(:lose corresl)ondence in order at the word level. For 
such languages, even phrase level alignment, not to 
mei~tion word aligmnent, does not gives good trans- 
lation due to structural diflbrence. Itence, structural 
features beyond word or t)hrase should t)e consid- 
ered to get t)etter translation 1)etween English and 
Koreml. In addition, the construction of structural 
bilingual texts would be more informative for ex- 
tracting linguistic knowledge. 
In this paper, we suggest a method for structural 
mat)t)ing of bilingual language on the basis of the 
maximum entorl)y and feature induction fl'alnework. 
Our model based on POS tag sequence mapl)ing has 
two advantages: First;, it can reduce a lot of 1)armne- 
ters in statistical machilm translation by eliminating 
syntactically unlikely aligmnents. Second, it: can be 
used as a t)reprocessor for lexical alignments of bilin- 
gual corpora although it; (:an be also exl)loited 1)y it- 
self tbr alignment. In this case, it would serve as the 
first stet) of alignment for reducing the 1)arameter 
sI)ace.

2 Mot ivat ion  
In order to devise parameters for statistical model- 
ing of translation, we started our research from the 
IBM model which has bee:: widely used by :nany 
researches. The IBM model is represented with the 
formula shown in (1) 
l 17t 
v(f, al ) = I I  I-I t(fJ l%)d(jlaj,m, l) 
i=1 j= l  
(1) 
Here, n is the fertility probability that an English 
word generates n h'end:  words, t is tim aligmnent 
probability that the English word c generates the 
French word f ,  and d is the distortion probability 
that an English word in a certain t)osition will gener- 
ate a lh'ench word in a certain 1)osition. This formula 
is Olm of many ways in which p(f, ale ) can tie writtm. 
as the product of a series of conditional prot)at)ilities. 
In above model, the distortion probability is re-- 
lated with positional preference(word order). Since 
Korean is a free order language, the probability is 
not t~asible in English-Korean translation. 
Furthermore, the difference between two lan- 
guages leads to the discordance between words that 
the one-to-one correst)ondence b tween words gen- 
erally does not keel). The n:odel (1), however, as-- 
sumed that an English word cat: be connected with 
multiple French words, but that each French word 
is connected to exactly one English word inch:ding 
the empty word. hl conclusion, many-to-:nany :nap-- 
pings are not allowed in this model. 
According to our ext)eri:nent, inany-to-nmny 
mappings exceed 40% in English and Korean lexical 
aligninents. Only 25.1% of then: can be explained 
by word for word correspondences. It means that we 
need a statistical model which can lmndle phrasal 
mat) pings. 
In the case of the phrasal mappings, a lot of pa- 
rameters hould be searched eve:: if we restrict the 
length of word strings. Moreover, in order to prop-- 
erly estimate t)arameters we need much larger voI-- 
ume of bilingual aligned text than it in word-for- 
word modeling. Even though such a large corpora 
exist sometimes, they do not come up with the lex-- 
ical alignments. 
For this problem, we here consider syntactic fea- 
tures which are importmlt in determining structures. 
A structural feature means here a mapt)ing between 
tag sequences in bilingual parallel sentences. 
If we are concerned with tag sequence alignments, 
it is possible to estimate statistical t)armneters in 
a relatively small size of corpora. As a result, we 
can remarkably reduce the problem space for possi- 
ble lexical alignments, a sort of t probability in (1), 
which improve the complexity of a statistical ma- 
chine translation model. 
If there are similarities between corresponding tag 
sequences in two language, tile structural features 
would be easily computed or recognized. However, 
a tag sequence in English can be often translated 
into a completely different tag sequence in Korean 
as follows. 
can/MD -+ ~-, cul/ENTR1 su/NNDE1 'iss/ AJMA 
da/ENTE 
It nmans that similarities of tag features between two 
languages are not; kept all the time and it is neces- 
saw to get the most likely tag sequence mappings 
that reflect structural correspondences between two 
languages. 
In this paper, the tag sequence mappings are ob- 
taind by automatic feature selection based on the 
maximum entropy model. 
3 Prob lem Set t ing  
In tiffs ctlat)ter, we describe how the features are 
related to the training data. Let tc be an English 
tag sequence and tk be a Korean tag sequence. Let 
Ts be the set of all possible tag sequence niapI)ings in 
a aligned sentence, S. We define a feature function 
(or a feature) as follows: 
1 pair(t~,tk) C "\]-s 
f(t~,tk) = 0 othcrwi.s'c 
It indicates co-occurrence information l)etween 
tags appeared in Ts. f(t?,tk) expresses the infor- 
mation for predicting that te maps into ta.. A fea- 
ture means a sort of inforination for predicting some- 
thing. In our model, co-occurrence information on 
the same aligned sentence is used for a feature, while 
context is used as a feature in Inost of systems using 
maximum entropy. It can be less informative than 
context. Hence, we considered an initial supervision 
and feature selection. 
Our model starts with initial seed(active) features 
for mapI)ing extracted by SUl)ervision. In the next 
step, thature pool is constructed from training sam- 
ples fro:n filtering and oifly features with a large gain 
to the model are added into active feature set. The 
final outputs of our model are the set of active t'ea- 
tures, their gain values, and conditional probabilities 
of features which maximize the model. Tim results 
can be embedded in parameters of statistical ma- 
chine translation and hell) to construct structural 
bilingual text. 
Most alignment algorithm consists of two steps: 
(1) estimate translation probabilities. 
(2) use these probabilities to search for most t)roba- 
ble alignment path. 
Our study is focused on (1), especially the part of 
tag string alignments. 
Next, we will explain the concept of the model. 
We are concerned with an ot)timal statistical inodel 
which can generate the traiifing samples. Nmnely, 
our task is to construct a stochastic model that pro-

We I)egan with training samples comi)osed of 
English-Korean aligned sentence t)airs, (e,k). Since 
they included long sentences, w(', 1)roke them into 
shorter ones. The length of training senl;en(:es was 
limited to ml(h',r 14 on the basis of English. It is 
reasona,bh; \])(',(:&llSe we are interested in not lexical 
alignments lint tag sequence aliglmients. The sam- 
ples were tagged using brill's tagger and qVIorany' 
that we iml)lenmnted as a Korean tagger. Figure \] 
shows the POS tags we considered. For simplicity, 
we adjusted some part of Brill's tag set. 
In the, sut)ervision step, 700 aligned sentences were 
used to construct he tag sequences mal)I)ings wlfich 
are referred to as an active feature set A. As Fig- 
ure 2 shows, there are several ways in constructing 
the corresl)ondem;es. We chose the third mapping 
although (1) can be more useflll to explain Korean 
with I)redieate-argunmnt structure. Since a subject 
of a English sentence is always used for a subject 
tbrln in Korean, we exlcuded a subject case fi'onl ar- 
gulnents of a l/redicate. For examl)le, 'they' is only 
used for a subject form, whereas 'me' is used for a 
object form and a dative form. 
II1 tile next step, training events, (t,:, It.) are con- 
structed to make a feature 1)eel froln training sam- 
pies. The event consists of a tag string t,, of a English

For a given sequence, the features were drawn 
fl'om all adjacent i)ossible I)airs and sonic interrupted 
pairs. Only features (tci, tfii ) out of the feature pool 
that meet the following conditions are extracted.

sentence , 'take her out - g'mdCOrcul baggcuro 
dcrfleoflara'. 
Since the set of the structural ti;atm'es for align- 
ment modeling is vast, we constructed a maximum 
entrol)y model for p(tkltc) by the iterative model 
growing method. 
4 Maximum Ent ropy  
To explain our method, we l)riefly des(:ribe the con- 
(:ept of maximum entrol)y. Recently, many al)- 
lnoaches l)ased on the maximum entroi)y lnodel have 
t)een applied to natural anguage processing (Berger 
eL al., \]994; Berger et al, 1996; Pietra et al, 1997). 
Suppose a model p which assigns a probability to 
a random variable. If we don't have rely knowledge, 
a reasonal)le solution for p is the most unifbrnl dis- 
tribution. As some knowledge to estilnate the model 
p are added, tile solution st)ace of p are more con- 
strained and the model would lie close to the ol\]timal 
probability model. 
For the t)url/ose of getting tile optimal 1)robability 
model, we need to maxi\]nize the unifl)rnlity under 
some constraints we have. ltere, the constraints are 
related with features. A feature, fi is usually rel/re - 
sented with a binary indicator funct, ion. The inlpor- 
tahoe of a feature, fi can be identified by requiring 
that the model accords with it. 
As a (:onstraint, the expected vahle of fi with re- 
spect to tile model P(fi) is supposed to be the same 
as tile exl)ected value of fi with respect o empiri(:al 
distril)ution in training saml)les, P(fi).

In sun1, the maxilnunl entropy fralnework finds 
the model which has highest entropy(most uniform)~ 
given constraints. It is related to the constrained 
optimization. To select a model from a constrained 
set, C of allowed l)rol)ability distributions, the model 
p, C C with maximum entropy H(p) is chosen. 
In general, for the constrained optimization prob- 
lem, Lagrange inultipliers of the number of features 
can be used. However, it was proved that the model 
with maximum entropy is equivalent o the model 
that maximizes the log likelihood of the training 
samples like (2) if we can assume it as an exponential 
model. 
hi (2), the left side is Lagrangian of the condi-. 
tional entropy and the right side is inaxilnlHn log-. 
likelihood. We use the right side equation of (2) to

The total saml)les consists of 3,000 aligned Sellteiice 
pairs of English-Korean, which were extracted from 
news on the web site of 'Korea Times' and a. maga- 
zine fl)r English learning. 
In the initial step, we manually constucted (;tie 
correspondences of tag sequences with 700 POS- 
tagged sentence I)airs. hi the SUl)ervision step, 
we extracte(t l.,d83 correct tag sequence corresl)on- 
it(miles its shown in Table 2, and it work as active 
features. As a feature I)OOI, 3,172 (lisjoint %a(;ures 
of tag sequence ma.I)pings were retrieved. 1% is very 
important o make atomic thatures. 
We maxinfized A of active features with resl)ect

because of tagging errors. Note that in the case of 
'PN+PPCA2+PPAD+VBMA' ,  it is not an adjacent 
string but an interrupted string. It means ttlat a 
verb in English generally map to a verb taking as 
argument the accusative and adverbial postposition 
in Korean. 
One way of testing usefulness of our method is 
to construct structured aligned bil ingual sentences. 
Table 3 shows lexical al ignments using tag sequence 
al ignments drawn from our algorithm for a given 
sentence, 'you usually have to take regular seating 
- dangsineun dachcw ilbanscokc anjayaman handa' 
and Figure 5 shows the best lexical alignment of the 
sentence. 
We conducted the exi)eriment on 100 sentences 
composed of words in length 14 or less and siln- 
lilY chose the most likely paths. As tim result, the 
accuray was about 71.1~. It shows that we can 
partly use the tag sequence alignments for lexical 
alignments. We will extend tlle structural mapping 
model with consideration to the lexical information. 
The parmneters, the conditional probabilities about 
stuctural mappings will be embedded in a statisti- 
cal model. Table 4 shows conditional probabilities 
of seine features according to 'DT+NN'.  In general, 
determiner is translated into NULL or adnominal 
word in Korean. 
7 Conclus ion 
When aligning Englist>Korean sentences, the differ- 
ences of word order and word unit require structural 
information. For tiffs reason, we tried structural tag

Table 4: Conditional Probability 
string mapping using maximum entropy modeling 
and feature selection concept. We devised a nlodel 
that generates a English tag string given a Korean 
tag string. From initial active structural features, 
useful features are extended by feature selection. 
Tile retrieved features and parameters can be em- 
bedded in statistical maclfine translation and reduce 
the complexity of searching. We showed that they 
can helpful to construct structured aligned bilingual 
sentences.
