Abstract 
Based on linguistic generalizations, we 
enhanced an existing semantic processor, 
SemRep, for effective interpretation of a 
wide range of patterns used to express 
arguments of nominalization in clinically 
oriented biomedical text. Nominaliza-
tions are pervasive in the scientific litera-
ture, yet few text mining systems ade-
quately address them, thus missing a 
wealth of information. We evaluated the 
system by assessing the algorithm inde-
pendently and by determining its contri-
bution to SemRep generally. The first 
evaluation demonstrated the strength of 
the method through an F-score of 0.646 
(P=0.743, R=0.569), which is more than 
20 points higher than the baseline. The 
second evaluation showed that overall 
SemRep results were increased to F-score 
0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximate-
ly 25 points better than processing with-
out nominalizations. 
1 Introduction 
Extracting semantic relations from text and 
representing them as predicate-argument struc-
tures is increasingly seen as foundational for 
mining the biomedical literature (Kim et al, 
2008). Most research has focused on relations 
indicated by verbs (Wattarujeekrit et al, 2004; 
Kogan et al, 2005). However nominalizations, 
gerunds, and relational nouns also take argu-
ments. For example, the following sentence has 
three nominalizations, treatment, suppression, 
and lactation (nominalized forms of the verbs 
treat, suppress, and lactate, respectively). Agon-
ist is derived from agonize, but indicates an 
agent rather than an event. 
Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid dopamine 
agonist, is a recent common treatment for 
suppression of lactation in postpartum wom-
en. 
In promoting economy of expression, nomina-
lizations are pervasive in scientific discourse, 
particularly the molecular biology sublanguage, 
due to the highly nested and complex biomolecu-
lar interactions described (Friedman et al, 2002). 
However, Cohen et al (2008) point out that no-
minalizations are more difficult to process than 
verbs. Although a few systems deal with them, 
the focus is often limited in both the nominaliza-
tions recognized and the patterns used to express 
their arguments.  Inability to interpret nominal 
constructions in a general way limits the effec-
tiveness of such systems, since a wealth of 
knowledge is missed.  
In this paper, we discuss our recent work on 
interpreting nominal forms and their arguments. 
We concentrate on nominalizations; however, the 
analysis also applies to other argument-taking 
nouns. Based on training data, we developed a 
set of linguistic generalizations and enhanced an 
existing semantic processor, SemRep, for effec-
tive interpretation of a wide range of patterns 
used to express arguments of nominalization in 
clinically oriented biomedical text. We evaluated 
the enhancements in two ways: by examining the 
ability to identify arguments of nominals inde-
pendently and the effect these enhancements had 
on the overall quality of SemRep output. 
2 Background 
The theoretical linguistics literature has ad-
dressed the syntax of nominalizations (e.g. 
Chomsky, 1970; Grimshaw, 1990; Grimshaw 
and Williams, 1993), however, largely as support 
for theoretical argumentation, rather than de-
tailed description of the facts. Quirk et al (1985) 
concentrate on the morphological derivation of 
46
nominalizations from verbs. Within the context 
of NomBank, a project dedicated to annotation of 
argument structure, Meyers et al (2004a) de-
scribe the linguistics of nominalizations, empha-
sizing semantic roles.  However, major syntactic 
patterns of argument realization are also noted. 
Cohen et al (2008) provide a comprehensive 
overview of nominalizations in biomedical text. 
They include a review of the relevant literature, 
and discuss a range of linguistic considerations, 
including morphological derivation, passiviza-
tion, transitivity, and semantic topics (e.g. 
agent/instrument (activator) vs. ac-
tion/process/state (activation)). Based on an 
analysis of the PennBioIE corpus (Kulick et al, 
2004), detailed distributional results are provided 
on alternation patterns for several nominaliza-
tions with high frequency of occurrence in bio-
medical text, such as activation and treatment.  
In computational linguistics, PUNDIT (Dahl 
et al, 1987) exploited similarities between nomi-
nalizations and related verbs.  Hull and Gomez 
(1996) describe semantic interpretation for a li-
mited set of nominalizations, relying on Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) senses for restricting fillers 
of semantic roles. Meyers et al (1998) present a 
procedure which maps syntactic and semantic 
information for verbs into a set of patterns for 
nominalizations. They use NOMLEX (MacLeod 
et al, 1998), a nominalization lexicon, as the ba-
sis for this transformation. More recently, the 
availability of the NomBank corpus (Meyers et 
al., 2004b) has supported supervised machine 
learning for nominal semantic role labeling (e.g. 
Pradhan et al, 2004; Jiang and Ng, 2006; Liu 
and Ng, 2007). In contrast, Pad? et al (2008) use 
unsupervised machine learning for semantic role 
labeling of eventive nominalizations by exploit-
ing similarities between the argument structure 
of event nominalizations and corresponding 
verbs. Gurevich and Waterman (2009) use a 
large parsed corpus of Wikipedia to derive lexi-
cal models for determining the underlying argu-
ment structure of nominalizations.   
Nominalizations have only recently garnered 
attention in biomedical language processing. Ge-
neScene (Leroy and Chen, 2005) considers only 
arguments of nominalizations marked by prepo-
sitional cues. Similarly, Schuman and Bergler 
(2006) focus on the problem of prepositional 
phrase attachment. In the BioNLP?09 Shared 
Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al, 2009), the 
most frequent predicates were nominals. Several 
participating systems discuss techniques that ac-
commodate nominalizations (e.g. K. B. Cohen et 
al., 2009; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009). Nomina-
lizations have not previously been addressed in 
clinically oriented text.  
2.1 SemRep 
SemRep (Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003) auto-
matically extracts semantic predications (logical 
subject-predicate-logical object triples) from un-
structured text (titles and abstracts) of MED-
LINE citations.  It uses domain knowledge from 
the Unified Medical Language System? (UMLS 
?) (Bodenreider, 2004), and the interaction of 
this knowledge and (underspecified) syntactic 
structure supports a robust system. SemRep ex-
tracts a range of semantic predications relating to 
clinical medicine (e.g. TREATS, DIAGNOSES, AD-
MINISTERED_TO, PROCESS_OF, LOCATION_OF), 
substance interactions (INTERACTS_WITH, INHI-
BITS, STIMULATES), and genetic etiology of dis-
ease (ASSOCIATED_WITH, PREDISPOSES, CAUS-
ES). For example, the program identifies the fol-
lowing predications from input text MRI re-
vealed a lacunar infarction in the left internal 
capsule. Arguments are concepts from the 
UMLS Metathesaurus and predicates are rela-
tions from the Semantic Network.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging DIAGNOSES Infarc-
tion, Lacunar  
Internal Capsule LOCATION_OF Infarction, Lacu-
nar 
Processing relies on an underspecified syntac-
tic analysis based on the UMLS SPECIALIST 
Lexicon (McCray et al, 1994) and the MedPost 
part-of-speech tagger (Smith et al, 2004). Output 
includes phrase identification, and for simple 
noun phrases, labeling of heads and modifiers.  
[HEAD(MRI)] [revealed] [a MOD(lacunar), 
HEAD(infarction)] [in the MOD(left) MOD(internal), 
HEAD(capsule).] 
MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) maps sim-
ple noun phrases to UMLS Metathesaurus con-
cepts, as shown below. Associated semantic 
types are particularly important for subsequent 
processing. 
[HEAD(MRI){Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Di-
agnostic Procedure)}] [revealed] [a 
MOD(lacunar), HEAD(infarction) {Infarction, Lacu-
nar(Disease or Syndrome)}] [in the MOD(left) 
MOD(internal), HEAD(capsule) {Internal Cap-
sule(Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component)}.] 
47
This structure is the basis for extracting semantic 
predications, which relies on several mechan-
isms. Indicator rules map syntactic phenomena, 
such as verbs, nominalizations, prepositions, and 
modifier-head structure in the simple noun 
phrase to ontological predications. Examples in-
clude: 
reveal (verb) ? DIAGNOSES 
in (prep) ? LOCATION_OF 
SemRep currently has 630 indicator rules. Onto-
logical predications are based on a modified ver-
sion of the UMLS Semantic Network and have 
semantic types as arguments. For example:  
Diagnostic Procedure DIAGNOSES Disease or 
Syndrome 
Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component LOCA-
TION_OF Disease or Syndrome 
Construction of a semantic predication begins 
with the application of an indicator rule, and is 
then constrained by two things. Arguments must 
satisfy syntactic restrictions for the indicator and 
must have been mapped to Metathesaurus con-
cepts that match the arguments of the ontological 
predication indicated. As part of this processing, 
several syntactic phenomena are addressed, in-
cluding passivization, argument coordination, 
and some types of relativization. For both verb 
and preposition indicators, underspecified syn-
tactic rules simply ensure that subjects are on the 
left and objects on the right. Enhancing SemRep 
for nominalizations involved extending the syn-
tactic constraints for arguments of nominaliza-
tion indicators.  
3 Methods 
In order to gain insight into the principles under-
lying expression of nominal arguments, we first 
determined the 50 most common nominalizations 
in MEDLINE citations that also occur in the 
UMLS SPECIALIST Lexicon, and then analyzed 
a corpus of 1012 sentences extracted from 476 
citations containing those nominalizations. We 
further limited these sentences to those with no-
minalizations containing two overt arguments 
(since SemRep only extracts predications with 
two arguments), resulting in a final set of 383 
sentences. We determined 14 alternation patterns 
for nominalizations based on this analysis and 
devised an algorithm to accommodate them. We 
then conducted two evaluations, one to assess the 
effectiveness of the algorithm independently of 
other considerations and another to assess the 
contribution of enhanced nominalization 
processing to SemRep generally.  
3.1 Nominal Alternations  
Much work in identifying arguments of nomina-
lizations assigns semantic role, such as agent, 
patient, etc., but SemRep does not. In this analy-
sis, arguments are logical subject and object. Re-
lational nouns often allow only one argument 
(e.g. the weight of the evidence), and either one 
or both of the arguments of a nominalization or 
gerund may be left unexpressed. SemRep doesn?t 
interpret nominalizations with unexpressed ar-
guments. If both arguments appear, they fall into 
one of several patterns, and the challenge in no-
minalization processing is to accommodate these 
patterns. Cohen et al (2008) note several such 
patterns, including those in which both argu-
ments are to the right of the nominalization, cued 
by prepositions (treatment of fracture with sur-
gery), the nominalization separates the argu-
ments (fracture treatment with surgery, surgical 
treatment for fracture), and both arguments pre-
cede the nominalizations, as modifiers of it (sur-
gical fracture treatment and fracture surgical 
treatment).  
Cohen et al (2008) do not list several patterns 
we observed in the clinical domain, including 
those in which the subject appears to the right 
marked by a verb (the treatment of fracture is 
surgery) or as an appositive (the treatment of 
fracture, surgery), and those in which the subject 
appears to the left and the nominalization is ei-
ther in a prepositional phrase (surgery in the 
treatment of fracture, surgery in fracture treat-
ment) or is preceded by a verb or is parenthetical 
(surgery is (the best) treatment for fracture; sur-
gery is (the best) fracture treatment; surgery, the 
best fracture treatment). One pattern, in which 
both arguments are on the right and the subject 
precedes the object, is seen most commonly in 
the clinical domain when the nominalization has 
a lexically specified cue (e.g. the contribution of 
stem cells to kidney repair). The nominal alterna-
tion patterns are listed in Table 1. 
Generalizations about arguments of nominali-
zations are based on the position of the argu-
ments, both with respect to each other and to the 
nominalization, and whether they modify the 
nominalization or not. A modifying argument is 
internal to the simple noun phrase of which the 
nominalization is the head; other arguments 
(both to the left and to the right) are external. 
(Relativization is considered external to the sim-
ple noun phrase.)

Table 1. Patterns 
Argument cuing plays a prominent role in de-
fining these patterns. A cue is an overt syntactic 
element associated with an argument, and can be 
a preposition, a verb (most commonly a form of 
be), a comma, or parenthesis. A cued argument is 
in a dependency with the cue, which is itself in a 
dependency with the nominalization. The cue 
must occur between the nominalization and the 
argument, whether the argument is to the right 
(e.g. treatment of fracture) or to the left (e.g. 
surgery in the treatment). Prepositional cues for 
the objects of some nominalizations are stipu-
lated in the lexicon; some of these are obligatory 
(e.g. contribution ? to), while others are optional 
(treatment ? for).  
External arguments of nominalizations must 
be cued, and cues unambiguously signal the role 
of the argument, according to the following 
cuing rules (Cohen et al, 2008). Verbs, comma, 
parenthesis, and the prepositions by, with, and 
via cue subjects only. (By is used for semantic 
role agent and with for instrument, but SemRep 
does not exploit this distinction.) Of cues sub-
jects only if the nominalization has an obligatory 
(object) cue; it must cue objects otherwise. There 
is a class of nominalizations (e.g. cause) that do 
not allow a prepositionally cued subject. Consi-
derable variation is seen in the order of subject 
and object; however, if the subject intervenes 
between the nominalization and the object, both 
must have equal cuing status (the only possibili-
ties are that both be either uncued or cued with a 
preposition).  
3.2 Algorithm 
In extending SemRep for identifying arguments 
of nominalizations, existing machinery was ex-
ploited, namely shallow parsing, mapping simple 
noun phrases to Metathesaurus concepts, and the 
application of indicator rules to map nominaliza-
tions to enhanced Semantic Network ontological 
predications (which imposes restrictions on the 
semantic type of arguments). Finally, syntactic 
argument identification was enhanced specifical-
ly for nominalizations and exploits the linguistic 
generalizations noted. For example in the sen-
tence below, phrases have been identified and 
cervical cancer has been mapped to the Metathe-
saurus concept ?Cervix carcinoma? with seman-
tic type ?Neoplastic Process?, and vaccination to 
?Vaccination? (?Therapeutic or Preventive Pro-
cedure?). An indicator rule for prevention maps 
to the ontological predication ?Therapeutic or 
Preventive Procedure PREVENTS Neoplastic 
Process? (among others) in generating the predi-
cation: ?Vaccination PREVENTS Cervix carcino-
ma.? 
Therefore, prevention of cervical cancer with 
HPV vaccination may have a significant fi-
nancial impact.  
Processing to identify arguments for preven-
tion begins by determining whether the nomina-
lization has a lexically specified object cue. This 
information is needed to determine the cuing 
function of of. Since it is common for there to be 
at least one argument on the right, identification 
of arguments begins there. Arguments on the 
right are external and must be cued. If a cued 
argument is found, its role is determined by the 
argument cuing rules. Since prevention does not 
have a lexically specified cue, of marks its ob-
ject. Further, the semantic type of the concept for 
the object of of matches the object of the onto-
logical predication (?Neoplastic Process?).  
The algorithm next looks to the right of the 
first argument for the second argument. Since 
processing addresses only two arguments for 
nominalizations, subject and object, once the role 
49
of the first has been determined, the second can 
be inferred. For cued arguments, the process 
checks that the cue is compatible with the cuing 
rules. In all cases, the relevant semantic type 
must match the subject of the ontological predi-
cation. In this instance, with cues subjects and 
?Therapeutic or Preventive Process? matches the 
subject of the ontological predication indicated.  
If only one noun phrase to the right satisfies 
the argument cuing rules, the second argument 
must be on the left. A modifier immediately to 
the left of the nominalization (and thus an inter-
nal argument) is sought first, and its role inferred 
from the first argument. Since internal arguments 
are not cued, there is no need to ensure cuing 
compatibility. The predication ?Operative Sur-
gical Procedures TREATS Pregnancy, Ectopic? 
is found for resolution in  
Surgical resolution of an ectopic pregnancy 
in a captive gerenuk (Litocranius walleri wal-
leri).  
Resolution is an indicator for the ontological 
predication ?Therapeutic or Preventive Proce-
dure TREATS Disease or Syndrome.? Surgical 
maps to ?Operative Surgical Procedures? (?The-
rapeutic or Preventive Procedure?), which 
matches the subject of this predication, and ec-
topic pregnancy maps to ?Pregnancy, Ectopic? 
(?Disease or Syndrome?), which matches its ob-
ject.  Of marks the object of resolution. 
An argument to the left of a nominalization 
may be external, in which case a cue is neces-
sary. For preceding treatment satisfies this re-
quirement in the following sentence. 
Preclinical data have supported the use of 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) in 
combination for the treatment of indolent 
lymphoid malignancies. 
The two drugs in this sentence map to concepts 
with semantic type ?Pharmacologic Substance? 
and the malignancy has ?Neoplastic Process?, as 
above. There is an ontological predication for 
TREATS with subject ?Pharmacologic Substance?. 
After coordination processing in SemRep, two 
predications are generated for treatment:  
Cyclophosphamide TREATS Malignant lymphoid 
neoplasm 
Fludarabine TREATS Malignant lymphoid neop-
lasm 
If there is no argument to the right, both ar-
guments must be on the left. A modifier imme-
diately to the left of the nominalization is sought 
first. Given the properties of cuing (the cue in-
tervenes between the argument and the nominali-
zation), if both arguments occur to the left, at 
least one of them must be internal, since it is not 
possible to have more than one external argu-
ment on the left (e.g. *Surgery is fracture for 
treatment). The role of the first argument is 
found based on semantic type. The first modifier 
to the left of treatment in the following sentence 
is epilepsy, which has semantic type ?Disease or 
Syndrome?, matching the object of the ontologi-
cal predication for TREATS.  
Patients with most chances of benefiting from 
surgical epilepsy treatment 
The second modifier to the left, surgical maps to 
the concept ?Operative Surgical Procedures,? 
whose semantic type matches the subject of the 
ontological predication. These conditions allow 
construction of the predication ?Operative Sur-
gical Procedures TREATS Epilepsy.?   
In the next sentence, the indicator rule for pre-
diction maps to the ontological predication 
?Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein PREDISPOSES 
Disease or Syndrome.?  
The potential clinical role of measuring these 
apolipoproteins for ischemic stroke predic-
tion warrants further study. 
Ischemic stroke satisfies the object of this predi-
cation and apolipoproteins the subject. Since the 
external subject is cued by for, all constraints are 
satisfied and the predication ?Apolipoproteins 
PREDISPOSES Ischemic stroke? is generated.   
3.3 Evaluation 
Three-hundred sentences from 239 MEDLINE 
citations (titles and abstracts) were selected for 
annotating a test set. Some had previously been 
selected for various aspects of SemRep evalua-
tion; others were chosen randomly. A small 
number (30) were sentences in the GENIA event 
corpus (Kim et al, 2008) with bio-event-
triggering nominalizations. Annotation was con-
ducted by three of the authors. One, a linguist 
(A), judged all sentences, while the other two, a 
computer scientist (B) and a medical informatics 
researcher (C), annotated a subset. Annotation 
was not limited to nominalizations. The statistics 
regarding the individual annotations are given 
below. The numbers in parentheses show the 
number of annotated predications indicated by 
nominalizations.

C 132 244 (134) 
Table 2. Annotation statistics 
As guidance, annotators were provided UMLS 
Metathesaurus concepts for the sentences. How-
ever, they consulted the Metathesaurus directly 
to check questionable mappings. Annotation fo-
cused on the 25 predicate types SemRep ad-
dresses.  
We measured inter-annotator agreement, de-
fined as the F-score of one set of annotations, 
when the second is taken as the gold standard. 
After individual annotations were complete, two 
annotators (A and C) assessed all three sets of 
annotations and created the final reference stan-
dard. The reference standard has 569 predica-
tions, 300 of which (52.7%) are indicated by 
nominalizations. We further measured the 
agreement between individual sets of annotations 
and the reference standard. Results are given be-
low:

Table 3. Inter-annotator agreement 
We performed two evaluations. The first (ev-
al1) evaluated nominalizations in isolation, while 
the second (eval2) assessed the effect of the en-
hancements on overall semantic interpretation in 
SemRep. For eval1, we restricted SemRep to 
extract predications indicated by nominalizations 
only. The baseline was a nominalization argu-
ment identification rule which simply stipulates 
that the subject of a predicate is a concept to the 
left (starting from the modifier of the nominali-
zation, if any), and the object is a concept to the 
right. This baseline implements the underspecifi-
cation principle of SemRep, without any addi-
tional logic. We compared the results from this 
baseline to those from the algorithm described 
above to identify arguments of nominalizations. 
The gold standard for eval1 was limited to predi-
cations indicated by nominalizations.  
We investigated the effect of nominalization 
processing on SemRep generally in eval2, for 
which the baseline implementation was SemRep 
with no nominalization processing. The results 
for this baseline were evaluated against those 
obtained using SemRep with no restrictions. 
Typical evaluation metrics, precision, recall, and 
F-score, were calculated. 
4 Results and Discussion 
The results for the two evaluations are presented 
below.

Table 4. Evaluation results 
Results illustrate the importance of nominali-
zation processing for effectiveness of semantic 
interpretation and show that the SemRep metho-
dology naturally extends to this phenomenon. 
With a single, simple, rule (eval1 baseline), Se-
mRep achieves an F-score of 0.412. With addi-
tional processing based on linguistic generaliza-
tions, F-score improves more than 20 points. 
Further, the addition of nominalization 
processing not only enhances the coverage of 
SemRep (more than 30 points), but also increases 
precision (more than 10 points). While nominali-
zations are generally considered more difficult to 
process than verbs (Cohen et al, 2008), we were 
able to accommodate them with greater precision 
than other types of indicators, including verbs 
(0.743 vs. 0.64 in eval1 with NOM vs. eval2 
baseline) with our patterns.

Table 5. Results for molecular biology sentences 
 
Limiting the evaluation to sentences focusing on 
biomolecular interactions (from GENIA), while 
not conclusive due to the small number of sen-
tences (30), also shows similar patterns, as 
shown in Table 5. As expected, while overall 
51
quality of predications is lower, since molecular 
biology text is significantly more complex than 
that in the clinical domain, improvements with 
nominalization processing are clearly seen. 
Errors were mostly due to aspects of SemRep 
orthogonal to but interacting with nominalization 
processing. Complex coordination structure was 
the main source of recall errors, as in the follow-
ing example.  
RESULTS: The best predictors of incident 
metabolic syndrome were waist circumfe-
rence (odds ratio [OR] 1.7 [1.3-2.0] per 11 
cm), HDL cholesterol (0.6 [0.4-0.7] per 15 
mg/dl), and proinsulin (1.7 [1.4-2.0] per 3.3 
pmol/l). [PMID 14988303] 
While the system was able to identify the predi-
cation ?Waist circumference PREDISPOSES 
Metabolic syndrome,? it was unable to find the 
predications below, due to its inability to identify 
the coordination of waist circumference, HDL 
cholesterol, and proinsulin.

drome

DISPOSES Metabolic syndrome 
 
Mapping of noun phrases to the correct UMLS 
concepts (MetaMap) is a source of both false 
positives and false negatives, particularly in the 
context of the molecular biology sentences, 
where acronyms and abbreviations are common 
and their disambiguation is nontrivial (Okazaki 
et al, 2010). For example, in the following sen-
tence  
PTK inhibition with Gen attenuated both 
LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and 
TNF-alpha production in human monocytes. 
[PMID 10210645] 
PTK was mapped to ?Ephrin receptor EphA8? 
rather than to ?Protein Tyrosine Kinase?, causing 
both a false positive and a false negative.  
(FP) Genistein INHIBITS Ephrin receptor EphA8

Some errors were due to failure to recognize a 
relative clause by SemRep. Only the head of 
such a structure is allowed to be an argument 
outside the structure. In the sentence below, the 
subject of treatment is hyperthermic intraperito-
neal intraoperative chemotherapy, which is the 
head of the reduced relative clause, after cytore-
ductive surgery.

chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery for 
the treatment of abdominal sarcomatosis:

consecutive patients. [PMID 15112276] 
SemRep failed to recognize the relative clause, 
and therefore the nominalization algorithm took 
the noun phrase inside it as the subject of treat-
ment, since it satisfies both semantic type and 
argument constraints.

A small number of errors were due solely to 
nominalization processing. In the following sen-
tence, the object of contribution is cued with in, 
rather than lexically specified to, which causes a 
recall error.

Accurate identification of the arguments of 
nominalizations in the molecular biology sub-
domain is more challenging than in clinically-
oriented text. Some of the syntactic structure re-
sponsible for this complexity is discussed by K. 
B. Cohen et al (2009). In particular, they note 
the problem of an argument being separated from 
the nominalization, and point out the problem of 
specifying the intervening structure. Although 
we have not focused on molecular biology, the 
analysis developed for clinical medicine shows 
promise in that domain as well. One relevant ex-
tension could address the syntactic configuration 
in which intervening structure involves an argu-
ment of a nominalization shared with a verb oc-
curring to the left of the nominalization, as in-
duced and activation interact in the following 
sentence: 
IL-2 induced less STAT1 alpha activation 
and IFN-alpha induced greater STAT5 acti-
vation in NK3.3 cells compared with preacti-
vated primary NK cells. [PMID 8683106] 
This could be addressed with an extension of our 
rule that subjects of nominalizations can be cued 
with verbs. With respect to argument identifica-
tion, induce can function like a form of be.

5 Conclusion 
We discuss a linguistically principled implemen-
tation for identifying arguments of nominaliza-
tions in clinically focused biomedical text. The 
full range of such structures is rarely addressed 
by existing text mining systems, thus missing 
valuable information. The algorithm is imple-
mented inside SemRep, a general semantic inter-
preter for biomedical text. We evaluated the sys-
tem both by assessing the algorithm independent-
ly and by determining the contribution it makes 
to SemRep generally. The first evaluation re-
sulted in an F-score of 0.646 (P=0.743, 
R=0.569), which is 20 points higher than the 
baseline, while the second showed that overall 
SemRep results were increased to F-score 0.689 
(P=0.745, R=0.640), approximately 25 points 
better than processing without nominalizations. 
Since our nominalization processing is by ex-
tending SemRep, rather than by creating a dedi-
cated system, we provide the interpretation of 
these structures in a broader context. An array of 
semantic predications generated by mapping to 
an ontology (UMLS) normalizes the interpreta-
tion of verbs and nominalizations.  Processing is 
linguistically based, and several syntactic phe-
nomena are addressed, including passivization, 
argument coordination, and relativization. The 
benefits of such processing include effective ap-
plications for extracting information on genetic 
diseases from text (Masseroli et al, 2006), as 
well as research in medical knowledge summari-
zation (Fiszman et al, 2004; Fiszman et al, 
2009), literature-based discovery (Ahlers et al, 
2007; Hristovski et al, 2010), and enhanced in-
formation retrieval (Kilicoglu et al, 2008; T. 
Cohen et al, 2009).
