Abstract
Supervised learning algorithms for identify-
ing comparable sentence pairs from a domi-
nantly non-parallel corpora require resources
for computing feature functions as well as
training the classifier. In this paper we pro-
pose active learning techniques for addressing
the problem of building comparable data for
low-resource languages. In particular we pro-
pose strategies to elicit two kinds of annota-
tions from comparable sentence pairs: class
label assignment and parallel segment extrac-
tion. We also propose an active learning strat-
egy for these two annotations that performs
significantly better than when sampling for ei-
ther of the annotations independently.
1 Introduction
The state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) sys-
tems are statistical, requiring large amounts of paral-
lel corpora. Such corpora needs to be carefully cre-
ated by language experts or speakers, which makes
building MT systems feasible only for those lan-
guage pairs with sufficient public interest or finan-
cial support. With the increasing rate of social media
creation and the quick growth of web media in lan-
guages other than English makes it relevant for lan-
guage research community to explore the feasibility
of Internet as a source for parallel data. (Resnik and
Smith, 2003) show that parallel corpora for a variety
of languages can be harvested on the Internet. It is to
be observed that a major portion of the multilingual
web documents are created independent of one an-
other and so are only mildly parallel at the document
level.
There are multiple challenges in building compa-
rable corpora for consumption by the MT systems.
The first challenge is to identify the parallelism be-
tween documents of different languages which has
been reliably done using cross lingual information
retrieval techniques. Once we have identified a sub-
set of documents that are potentially parallel, the
second challenge is to identify comparable sentence
pairs. This is an interesting challenge as the avail-
ability of completely parallel sentences on the inter-
net is quite low in most language-pairs, but one can
observe very few comparable sentences among com-
parable documents for a given language-pair. Our
work tries to address this problem by posing the
identification of comparable sentences from com-
parable data as a supervised classification problem.
Unlike earlier research (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005)
where the authors try to identify parallel sentences
among a pool of comparable documents, we try to
first identify comparable sentences in a pool with
dominantly non-parallel sentences. We then build
a supervised classifier that learns from user annota-
tions for comparable corpora identification. Train-
ing such a classifier requires reliably annotated data
that may be unavailable for low-resource language
pairs. Involving a human expert to perform such
annotations is expensive for low-resource languages
and so we propose active learning as a suitable tech-
nique to reduce the labeling effort.
There is yet one other issue that needs to be solved
in order for our classification based approach to
work for truly low-resource language pairs. As we
will describe later in the paper, our comparable sen-
tence classifier relies on the availability of an ini-

tial seed lexicon that can either be provided by a hu-
man or can be statistically trained from parallel cor-
pora (Och and Ney, 2003). Experiments show that a
broad coverage lexicon provides us with better cov-
erage for effective identification of comparable cor-
pora. However, availability of such a resource can
not be expected in very low-resource language pairs,
or even if present may not be of good quality. This
opens an interesting research question - Can we also
elicit such information effectively at low costs? We
propose active learning strategies for identifying the
most informative comparable sentence pairs which a
human can then extract parallel segments from.
While the first form of supervision provides us
with class labels that can be used for tuning the fea-
ture weights of our classifier, the second form of su-
pervision enables us to better estimate the feature
functions. For the comparable sentence classifier to
perform well, we show that both forms of supervi-
sion are needed and we introduce an active learning
protocol to combine the two forms of supervision
under a single joint active learning strategy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we survey earlier research as relevant to
the scope of the paper. In Section 3 we discuss the
supervised training setup for our classifier. In Sec-
tion 4 we discuss the application of active learning to
the classification task. Section 5 discusses the case
of active learning with two different annotations and
proposes an approach for combining them. Section 6
presents experimental results and the effectiveness
of the active learning strategies. We conclude with
further discussion and future work.
2 Related Work
There has been a lot of interest in using compara-
ble corpora for MT, primarily on extracting paral-
lel sentence pairs from comparable sources (Zhao
and Vogel, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998). Some work
has gone beyond this focussing on extracting sub-
sentential fragments from noisier comparable data
(Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; Quirk et al, 2007).
The research conducted in this paper has two pri-
mary contributions and so we will discuss the related
work as relevant to each of them.
Our first contribution in this paper is the appli-
cation of active learning for acquiring comparable
data in the low-resource scenario, especially rele-
vant when working with low-resource languages.
There is some earlier work highlighting the need
for techniques to deal with low-resource scenar-
ios.(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) propose bootstrap-
ping using an existing classifier for collecting new
data. However, this approach works when there is
a classifier of reasonable performance. In the ab-
sence of parallel corpora to train lexicons human
constructed dictionaries were used as an alternative
which may, however, not be available for a large
number of languages. Our proposal of active learn-
ing in this paper is suitable for highly impoverished
scenarios that require support from a human.
The second contribution of the paper is to ex-
tend the traditional active learning setup that is suit-
able for eliciting a single annotation. We highlight
the needs of the comparable corpora scenario where
we have two kinds of annotations - class label as-
signment and parallel segment extraction and pro-
pose strategies in active learning that involve multi-
ple annotations. A relevant setup is multitask learn-
ing (Caruana, 1997) which is increasingly becom-
ing popular in natural language processing for learn-
ing from multiple learning tasks. There has been
very less work in the area of multitask active learn-
ing. (Reichart et al, 2008) proposes an extension of
the single-sided active elicitation task to a multi-task
scenario, where data elicitation is performed for two
or more independent tasks at the same time. (Settles
et al, 2008) propose elicitation of annotations for
image segmentation under a multi-instance learning
framework.
Active learning with multiple annotations also has
similarities to the recent body of work in learn-
ing from instance feedback and feature feedback
(Melville et al, 2005). (Druck et al, 2009) pro-
pose active learning extensions to the gradient ap-
proach of learning from feature and instance feed-
back. However, in the comparable corpora problem
although the second annotation is geared towards
learning better features by enhancing the coverage
of the lexicon, the annotation itself is not on the fea-
tures but for extracting training data that is then used
to train the lexicon.

3 Supervised Comparable Sentence
Classification
In this section we discuss our supervised training
setup and the classification algorithm. Our classifier
tries to identify comparable sentences from among a
large pool of noisy comparable sentences. In this pa-
per we define comparable sentences as being trans-
lations that have around fifty percent or more trans-
lation equivalence. In future we will evaluate the ro-
bustness of the classifier by varying levels of noise
at the sentence level.
3.1 Training the Classifier
Following (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), we use a
Maximum Entropy classifier to identify comparable
sentences. The classifier probability can be defined
as:
Pr(ci|S, T ) = 1Z(S, T )exp
?
?
n?
j=1
?jfij(ci, S, T )
?
?
where (S, T ) is a sentence pair, ci is the class, fij
are feature functions and Z(S) is a normalizing fac-
tor. The parameters ?i are the weights for the fea-
ture functions and are estimated by optimizing on a
training data set. For the task of classifying a sen-
tence pair, there are two classes, c0 = comparable
and c1 = non parallel. A value closer to one for
Pr(c1|S, T ) indicates that (S, T ) are comparable.
To train the classifier we need comparable sen-
tence pairs and non-parallel sentence pairs. While
it is easy to find negative examples online, ac-
quiring comparable sentences is non-trivial and re-
quires human intervention. (Munteanu and Marcu,
2005) construct negative examples automatically
from positive examples by pairing all source sen-
tences with all target sentences. We, however, as-
sume the availability of both positive and negative
examples to train the classifier. We use the GIS
learning algorithm for tuning the model parameters.
3.2 Feature Computation
The features are defined primarily based on trans-
lation lexicon probabilities. Rather than computing
word alignment between the two sentences, we use
lexical probabilities to determine alignment points
as follows: a source word s is aligned to a target
word t if p(s|t) > 0.5. Target word alignment is
computed similarly. Long contiguous sections of
aligned words indicate parallelism. We use the fol-
lowing features:
? Source and target sentence length ratio
? Source and target sentence length difference
? Lexical probability score, similar to IBM
model 1
? Number of aligned words
? Longest aligned word sequence
? Number of un-aligned words
Lexical probability score, and alignment features
generate two sets of features based on translation
lexica obtained by training in both directions. Fea-
tures are normalized with respect to the sentence
length.
Figure 1: Seed parallel corpora size vs. Classifier perfor-
mance in Urdu-English language pair
In our experiments we observe that the most in-
formative features are the ones involving the prob-
abilistic lexicon. However, the comparable corpora
obtained for training the classifier cannot be used for
automatically training a lexicon. We, therefore, re-
quire the availability of an initial seed parallel cor-
pus that can be used for computing the lexicon and
the associated feature functions. We notice that the
size of the seed corpus has a large influence on the
accuracy of the classifier. Figure 1 shows a plot with
71
the initial size of the corpus used to construct the
probabilistic lexicon on x-axis and its effect on the
accuracy of the classifier on y-axis. The sentences
were drawn randomly from a large pool of Urdu-
English parallel corpus and it is clear that a larger
pool of parallel sentences leads to a better lexicon
and an improved classifier.
4 Active Learning with Multiple
Annotations
4.1 Cost Motivation
Lack of existing annotated data requires reliable
human annotation that is expensive and effort-
intensive. We propose active learning for the prob-
lem of effectively acquiring multiple annotations
starting with unlabeled data. In active learning, the
learner has access to a large pool of unlabeled data
and sometimes a small portion of seed labeled data.
The objective of the active learner is then to se-
lect the most informative instances from the unla-
beled data and seek annotations from a human ex-
pert, which it then uses to retrain the underlying su-
pervised model for improving performance.
A meaningful setup to study multi annotation ac-
tive learning is to take into account the cost involved
for each of the annotations. In the case of compara-
ble corpora we have two annotation tasks, each with
cost modelsCost1 andCost2 respectively. The goal
of multi annotation active learning is to select the
optimal set of instances for each annotation so as to
maximize the benefit to the classifier. Unlike the tra-
ditional active learning, where we optimize the num-
ber of instances we label, here we optimize the se-
lection under a provided budget Bk per iteration of
the active learning algorithm.
4.2 Active Learning Setup
We now discuss our active learning framework for
building comparable corpora as shown in Algo-
rithm 1. We start with an unlabeled dataset U0 =
{xj =< sj , tj >} and a seed labeled dataset L0 =
{(< sj , tj >, ci)}, where c ? 0, 1 are class la-
bels with 0 being the non-parallel class and 1 being
the comparable data class. We also have T0 = {<
sk, tk >} which corresponds to parallel segments
or sentences identified from L0 that will be used in
training the probabilistic lexicon. Both T0 and L0
can be very small in size at the start of the active
learning loop. In our experiments, we tried with as
few as 50 to 100 sentences for each of the datasets.
We perform an iterative budget motivated active
learning loop for acquiring labeled data over k it-
erations. We start the active learning loop by first
training a lexicon with the available Tk and then us-
ing that we train the classifier over Lk. We, then
score all the sentences in the Uk using the model ?
and apply our selection strategy to retrieve the best
scoring instance or a small batch of instances. In the
simplest case we annotate this instance and add it
back to the tuning set Ck for re-training the classi-
fier. If the instance was a comparable sentence pair,
then we could also perform the second annotation
conditioned upon the availability of the budget. The
identified sub-segments (ssi , tti) are added back to
the training data Tk used for training the lexicon in
the subsequent iterations.

5 Sampling Strategies for Active Learning
5.1 Acquiring Training Data for Classifier
Our selection strategies for obtaining class labels for
training the classifier uses the model in its current
state to decide on the informative instances for the
next round of iterative training. We propose the fol-
lowing two sampling strategies for this task.
72
5.1.1 Certainty Sampling
This strategy selects instances where the current
model is highly confident. While this may seem
redundant at the outset, we argue that this crite-
ria can be a good sampling strategy when the clas-
sifier is weak or trained in an impoverished data
scenario. Certainty sampling strategy is a lot sim-
ilar to the idea of unsupervised approaches like
boosting or self-training. However, we make it a
semi-supervised approach by having a human in the
loop to provide affirmation for the selected instance.
Consider the following scenario. If we select an
instance that our current model prefers and obtain
a contradicting label from the human, then this in-
stance has a maximal impact on the decision bound-
ary of the classifier. On the other hand, if the label
is reaffirmed by a human, the overall variance re-
duces and in the process, it also helps in assigning
higher preference for the configuration of the deci-
sion boundary. (Melville et al, 2005) introduce a
certainty sampling strategy for the task of feature
labeling in a text categorization task. Inspired by
the same we borrow the name and also apply this
as an instance sampling approach. Given an in-
stance x and the classifier posterior distribution for
the classes as P (.), we select the most informative
instance as follows:
x? = argmaxxP (c = 1|x)
5.1.2 Margin-based Sampling
The certainty sampling strategy only considers the
instance that has the best score for the comparable
sentence class. However we could benefit from in-
formation about the second best class assigned to
the same instance. In the typical multi-class clas-
sification problems, earlier work shows success us-
ing such a ?margin based? approach (Scheffer et al,
2001), where the difference between the probabil-
ities assigned by the underlying model to the first
best and second best classes is used as the sampling
criteria.
Given a classifier with posterior distribution
over classes for an instance P (c = 1|x),
the margin based strategy is framed as x? =
argminxP (c1|x)? P (c2|x), where c1 is the best
prediction for the class and c2 is the second best
prediction under the model. It should be noted that
for binary classification tasks with two classes, the
margin sampling approach reduces to an uncertainty
sampling approach (Lewis and Catlett, 1994).
5.2 Acquiring Parallel Segments for Lexicon
Training
We now propose two sampling strategies for the sec-
ond annotation. Our goal is to select instances that
could potentially provide parallel segments for im-
proved lexical coverage and feature computation.
5.2.1 Diversity Sampling
We are interested in acquiring clean parallel seg-
ments for training a lexicon that can be used in fea-
ture computation. It is not clear how one could use a
comparable sentence pair to decide the potential for
extracting a parallel segment. However, it is highly
likely that if such a sentence pair has new cover-
age on the source side, then it increases the chances
of obtaining new coverage. We, therefore, propose
a diversity based sampling for extracting instances
that provide new vocabulary coverage . The scor-
ing function tc score(s) is defined below, where
V oc(s) is defined as the vocabulary of source sen-
tence s for an instance xi =< si, ti >, T is the set
of parallel sentences or segments extracted so far.
tc score(s) =
|T |?
s=1
sim(s, s?) ? 1|T | (1)
sim(s, s?) = |(V oc(s) ? V oc(s?)| (2)
5.2.2 Alignment Ratio
We also propose a strategy that provides direct in-
sight into the coverage of the underlying lexicon and
prefers a sentence pair that is more likely to be com-
parable. We call this alignment ratio and it can be
easily computed from the available set of features
discussed in Section 3 as below:
a score(s) = #unalignedwords#alignedwords (3)
s? = argmaxsa score(s) (4)
This strategy is quite similar to the diversity based
approach as both prefer selecting sentences that have
73
a potential to offer new vocabulary from the com-
parable sentence pair. However while the diver-
sity approach looks only at the source side coverage
and does not depend upon the underlying lexicon,
the alignment ratio utilizes the model for computing
coverage. It should also be noted that while we have
coverage for a word in the sentence pair, it may not
make it to the probabilistically trained and extracted
lexicon.
5.3 Combining Multiple Annotations
Finally, given two annotations and corresponding
sampling strategies, we try to jointly select the sen-
tence that is best suitable for obtaining both the an-
notations and is maximally beneficial to the classi-
fier. We select a single instance by combining the
scores from the different selection strategies as a
geometric mean. For instance, we consider a mar-
gin based sampling (margin) for the first annota-
tion and a diversity sampling (tc score) for the sec-
ond annotation, we can jointly select a sentence that
maximizes the combined score as shown below:
total score(s) = margin(s) ? tc score(s) (5)
s? = argmaxstotal score(s) (6)
6 Experiments and Results
6.1 Data
This research primarily focuses on identifying com-
parable sentences from a pool of dominantly non-
parallel sentences. To our knowledge, there is a
dearth of publicly available comparable corpora of
this nature. We, therefore, simulate a low-resource
scenario by using realistic assumptions of noise
and parallelism at both the corpus-level and the
sentence-level. In this section we discuss the pro-
cess and assumptions involved in the creation of our
datasets and try to mimic the properties of real-world
comparable corpora harvested from the web.
We first start with a sentence-aligned parallel cor-
pus available for the language pair. We then divide
the corpus into three parts. The first part is called
the ?sampling pool? and is set aside to use for draw-
ing sentences at random. The second part is used
to act as a non-parallel corpus. We achieve non-
parallelism by randomizing the mapping of the tar-
get sentences with the source sentences. This is a
slight variation of the strategy used in (Munteanu
and Marcu, 2005) for generating negative examples
for their classifier. The third part is used to synthe-
size a comparable corpus at the sentence-level. We
perform this by first selecting a parallel sentence-
pair and then padding either sides by a source and
target segment drawn independently from the sam-
pling pool. We control the length of the non-parallel
portion that is appended to be lesser than or equal
to the original length of the sentence. Therefore, the
resulting synthesized comparable sentence pairs are
guaranteed to contain at least 50% parallelism.
We use this dataset as the unlabeled pool from
which the active learner selects instances for label-
ing. Since the gold-standard labels for this corpus
are already available, which gives us better control
over automating the active learning process, which
typically requires a human in the loop. However,
our active learning strategies are in no way limited
by the simulated data setup and can generalize to the
real world scenario with an expert providing the la-
bels for each instance.
We perform our experiments with data from two
language pairs: Urdu-English and Spanish-English.
For Urdu-English, we use the parallel corpus NIST
2008 dataset released for the translation shared task.
We start with 50,000 parallel sentence corpus from
the released training data to create a corpus of
25,000 sentence pairs with 12,500 each of compa-
rable and non-parallel sentence pairs. Similarly, we
use 50,000 parallel sentences from the training data
released by the WMT 2008 datasets for Spanish-
English to create a corpus of 25,000 sentence pairs.
We also use two held-out data sets for training and
tuning the classifier, consisting of 1000 sentence
pairs (500 non-parallel and 500 comparable).
6.2 Results
We perform two kinds of evaluations: the first, to
show that our active learning strategies perform well
across language pairs and the second, to show that
multi annotation active learning leads to a good im-
provement in performance of the classifier.
6.2.1 How does the Active Learning perform?
In section 5, we proposed multiple active learn-
ing strategies for both eliciting both kinds of annota-
tions. A good active learning strategy should select
74
instances that contribute to the maximal improve-
ment of the classifier. The effectiveness of active
learning is typically tested by the number of queries
the learner asks and the resultant improvement in
the performance of the classifier. The classifier per-
formance in the comparable sentence classification
task can be computed as the F-score on the held out
dataset. For this work, we assume that both the an-
notations require the same effort level and so assign
uniform cost for eliciting each of them. Therefore
the number of queries is equivalent to the total cost
of supervision.
Figure 2: Active learning performance for the compara-
ble corpora classification in Urdu-English language-pair
Figure 3: Active learning performance for the compara-
ble corpora classification in Spanish-English language-
pair
Figure 2 shows our results for the Urdu-English
language pair, and Figure 3 plots the Spanish-
English results with the x-axis showing the total
number of queries posed to obtain annotations and
the y-axis shows the resultant improvement in accu-
racy of the classifier. In these experiments we do
not actively select for the second annotation but ac-
quire the parallel segment from the same sentence.
We compare this over a random baseline where the
sentence pair is selected at random and used for elic-
iting both annotations at the same time.
Firstly, we notice that both our active learn-
ing strategies: certainty sampling and margin-based
sampling perform better than the random baseline.
For the Urdu-English language pair we can see that
for the same effort expended (i.e 2000 queries) the
classifier has an increase in accuracy of 8 absolute
points. For Spanish-English language pair the ac-
curacy improvement is 6 points over random base-
line. Another observation from Figure 3 is that for
the classifier to reach an fixed accuracy of 68 points,
the random sampling method requires 2000 queries
while the from the active selection strategies require
significantly less effort of about 500 queries.
6.2.2 Performance of Joint Selection with
Multiple Annotations
We now evaluate our joint selection strategy that
tries to select the best possible instance for both
the annotations. Figure 4 shows our results for the
Urdu-English language pair, and Figure 5 plots the
Spanish-English results for active learning with mul-
tiple annotations. As before, the x-axis shows the
total number of queries posed, equivalent to the cu-
mulative effort for obtaining the annotations and the
y-axis shows the resultant improvement in accuracy
of the classifier.
We evaluate the multi annotation active learning
against two single-sided baselines where the sam-
pling focus is on selecting instances according to
strategies suitable for one annotation at a time. The
best performing active learning strategy for the class
label annotations is the certainty sampling (annot1)
and so for one single-sided baseline, we use this
baseline. We also obtain the second annotation for
the same instance. By doing so, we might be se-
lecting an instance that is sub-optimal for the sec-
ond annotation and therefore the resultant lexicon
may not maximally benefit from the instance. We
also observe, from our experiments, that the diver-
sity based sampling works well for the second anno-
75
tation and alignment ratio does not perform as well.
So, for the second single-sided baseline we use the
diversity based sampling strategy (annot2) and get
the first annotation for the same instance. Finally
we compare this with the joint selection approach
proposed earlier that combines both the annotation
strategies (annot1+annot2). In both the language
pairs we notice that joint selection for both anno-
tations performs better than the baselines.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed active learning with mul-
tiple annotations for the challenge of building com-
parable corpora in low-resource scenarios. In par-
ticular, we identified two kinds of annotations: class
labels (for identifying comparable vs. non-parallel
data) and clean parallel segments within the com-
parable sentences. We implemented multiple inde-
pendent strategies for obtaining each of the abve in
a cost-effective manner. Our active learning experi-
ments in a simulated low-resource comparable cor-
pora scenario across two language pairs show signif-
icant results over strong baselines. Finally we also
proposed a joint selection strategy that selects a sin-
gle instance which is beneficial to both the annota-
tions. The results indicate an improvement over sin-
gle strategy baselines.
There are several interesting questions for future
work. Throughout the paper we assumed uniform
costs for both the annotations, which will need to
be verified with human subjects. We also hypoth-
esize that obtaining both annotations for the same
sentence may be cheaper than getting them from two
different sentences due to the overhead of context
switching. Another assumption is that of the exis-
tence of a single contiguous parallel segment in a
comparable sentence pair, which needs to be veri-
fied for corpora on the web.
Finally, active learning assumes availability of an
expert to answer the queries. Availability of an ex-
pert for low-resource languages and feasibility of
running large scale experiments is difficult. We,
therefore, have started working on crowdsourcing
these annotation tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk) where it is easy to find people and quickly
run experiments with real people.
