Abstract
Most studies on speech-based emotion
recognition are based on prosodic and
acoustic features, only employing artifi-
cial acted corpora where the results cannot
be generalized to telephone-based speech
applications. In contrast, we present an
approach based on utterances from 1,911
calls from a deployed telephone-based
speech application, taking advantage of
additional dialogue features, NLU features
and ASR features that are incorporated
into the emotion recognition process. De-
pending on the task, non-acoustic features
add 2.3% in classification accuracy com-
pared to using only acoustic features.
1 Introduction
Certainly, the most relevant employment of
speech-based emotion recognition is that of a
telephone-based Interactive Voice Response Sys-
tem (IVR).
Emotion recognition for IVR differs insofar
to ?traditional? emotion recognition, that it can
be reduced to a binary classification problem,
namely the distinction between angry and non-
angry whereas studies on speech-based emotion
recognition analyze complete and relatively long
sentences covering the full bandwidth of human
emotions. In a way, emotion recognition in the
telephone domain is less challenging since a dis-
tinction between two different emotion classes,
angry and non-angry, is sufficient. We don?t have
to expect callers talking to IVRs in a sad, anxious,
happy, disgusted or bored manner. I.e., even if a
caller is happy, the effect on the dialogue will be
the same as if he is neutral. However, there still
remain challenges for the system developer such
as varying speech quality caused by, e.g., vary-
ing distance to the receiver during the call lead-
ing to loudness variations (which emotion recog-
nizers might mistakenly interpret as anger). But
also bandwidth limitation introduced by the tele-
phone channel and a strongly unbalanced distribu-
tion of non-angry and angry utterances with more
than 80% non-angry utterances make a reliable
distinction of the caller emotion difficult. While
hot anger with studio quality conditions can be de-
termined with over 90% (Pittermann et al, 2009)
studies on IVR anger recognition report lower ac-
curacies due to these limitations. However, there
is one advantage of anger recognition in IVR sys-
tems that can be exploited: additional information
is available from the dialogue context, the speech
recognizer and the natural language parser.
This contribution is organized as follows: first,
we introduce related work and describe our cor-
pus. In Section 4 we outline our employed features
with emphasis on the non-acoustic ones. Experi-
ments are shown in Section 5 where we analyze
the impact of the newly developed features before
we summarize our work in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Speech-based emotion research regarding tele-
phone applications has been increasingly dis-
cussed in the speech community. While in early
studies acted corpora were used, such as in (Ya-
coub et al, 2003), training and testing data in later
studies has been more and more based on real-
life data, see (Burkhardt et al, 2008),(Burkhardt
et al, 2009). Most studies are limited to acous-
tic/prosodic features that have been extracted out
of the audio data. Linguistic information was ad-
ditionaly exploited in (Lee et al, 2002) resulting in
128
a 45.7% accuracy improvement compared to using
only acoustic features. In (Liscombe et al, 2005)
the lexical and prosodic features were additionaly
enriched with dialogue act features leading to an
increase in accuracy of 2.3%.
3 Corpus Description
For our studies we employed a corpus of 1,911
calls from an automated agent helping to resolve
internet-related problems comprising 22,724 utter-
ances. Three labelers divided the corpus into an-
gry, annoyed and non-angry utterances (Cohen?s
? = 0.70 on whole corpus; L1 vs. L2 ? = 0.8,
L1 vs. L3 ? = 0.71, L2 vs. L3 ? = 0.59). The
reason for choosing three emotion classes instead
of a binary classification lies in the hope to find
clearer patterns for strong anger. A distinction be-
tween non-angry and somewhat annoyed callers
is rather difficult even for humans. The final la-
bel was defined based on majority voting resulting
in 90.2% non-angry, 5.1% garbage, 3.4% annoyed
and 0.7% angry utterances. 0.6% of the samples in
the corpus were sorted out since all three raters had
different opinions. The raters were asked to label
?garbage? when the utterance is incomprehensible
or consists of non-speech events. While the num-
ber of angry and annoyed utterances seems very
low, 429 calls (i.e. 22.4%) contained annoyed or
angry utterances.
4 Features
We created two different feature sets: one based
on typical acoustic/prosodic features and another
one to which we will refer as ?non-acoustic? fea-
tures consisting of features from the Automatich
Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language
Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Manager (DM)
and Context features.
4.1 Acoustic Features
The acoustic/prosodic features were extracted
with the aid of Praat (Boersma, 2001) and con-
sist of power, mean, rms, mean harmonicity, pitch
(mean, deviation, voiced frames, time step, mean
slope, minimum, maximum, range), voiced pitch
(mean, minimum mean, maximum mean, range),
intensity (mean, maximum, minimum, deviation,
range), jitter points, formants 1-5, MFCC 1-12.
The extraction was performed on the complete
short utterance.
4.2 Non-Acoustic Features
The second, i.e. non-acoustic, feature set is based
on features logged with the aid of the speech plat-
form hosting the IVR application and is presented
here in more detail. They include:
ASR features: raw ASR transcription of
caller?s utterance (Utterance) (unigram bag-of-
words); ASR confidence of returned utterance
transcription, as floating point number between 0
(least confident) and 1 (most confident) (Confi-
dence); names of all grammars active (Grammar-
Name); name of the grammar that returned the
parse (TriggeredGrammarName); did the caller
begin speaking before the prompt completed?
(?yes?, ?no?) (BargedIn); did the caller communi-
cate with speech (?voice?) or keypad (?dtmf?) (In-
putModeName); was the speech recognizer suc-
cessful (?Complete?) or not and if it was not suc-
cessful, an error message is recorded such as
?NoInput? or ?NoMatch? (RecognitionStatus)
NLU-Features: the semantic parse of the caller
utterance as returned by the activated grammar in
the current dialog module (Interpretation); given
caller speech input, we need to try and recognize
the semantic meaning. The first time we try to do
this, this is indicated with a value of ?Initial?. If
we were not returned a parse then we have to re-
prompt (?Retry1? or ?Timeout1?). Similar for if the
caller asks for help or a repetition of the prompt.
Etc. (LoopName)
DM-Features: the text of what the auto-
mated agent said prior to recording the user input
(PromptName); the number of tries to elicit a de-
sired response. Integer values range from 0 (first
try) to 7 (6th try) (RoleIndex); an activity may re-
quest substantive user input (?Collection?) or con-
firm previous substantive input (?Confirmation?)
(RoleName); within a call each event is sequen-
tially organized by these numbers (SequenceID);
the name of the activity (aka dialog module) that
is active (ActivityName); type of activity. Possible
values are: Question, PlatformValue, Announce-
ment, Wait, Escalate (ActivityType)
Context-Features: We further developed addi-
tional cumulative features based on the previous
ones in order to keep track of the NoMatch, NoIn-
puts and similar parameters serving as an indicator
for the call quality: number of non-empty NLU
parses (CumUserTurns); number of statements
and questions by the system (CumSysTurns); num-
ber of questions (CumSysQuestions); number of
129
help requests by the user (CumHelpReq); num-
ber of operator requests (CumOperatorReq); num-
ber of NoInput events (CumNoInputs); number
of NoMatch events (CumNoMatchs) number of
BargeIns (CumBargeIns).
5 Experiments
In order to prevent an adaption of the anger model
to specific callers we seperated the corpus ran-
domly into 75% training and 25% testing material
and ensured that no speaker contained in training
was used for testing. To exclude that we receive a
good classification result by chance, we performed
50 iterations in each test and calculated the per-
formance?s mean and standard deviation over all
iterations.
Note, that our aim in this study is less finding
an optimum classifer, than finding additional fea-
tures that support the distinction between angry
and non-angry callers. Support Vector Machines
and Artificial Neural Networks are thus not con-
sidered, although the best performances are re-
ported with those learning algorithms. A simi-
lar performance, i.e. only slightly poorer, can be
reached with Rule Learners. They enable a thor-
ough study of the features, leading to the decision
for one or the other class, since they produce a
human readable set of if-then-else rules. Our hy-
potheses on a perfect feature set can thus easily be
confirmed or rejected.
We performed experiments with two differ-
ent classes: ?angry? vs. ?non-angry? and ?an-
gry+annoyed? vs. ?non-angry?. Merging angry
and annoyed utterances aims on finding all callers,
where the customer satisfaction is endangered. In
both tasks, we employ a) only acoustic features
b) only ASR/NLU/DM/Context features and c) a
combination of both feature sets. The number of
utterances used for training and testing is shown in
Table 1.
As result we expect acoustic features to per-
form better than non-acoustic features. Among
the relevant non-acoustic features we assume as
an indicator for angry utterances low ASR confi-
dences and high barge-in rates, which we consider
as signal for the caller?s impatience. All tests have
been performed with the machine learning frame-
work RapidMiner (Mierswa et al, 2006) featuring
all common supervised and unsupervised learning
schemes.
Results are listed in Table 2, including preci-

sion and recall values. As expected, Test B (an-
gry vs. non-angry) has the highest accuracy with
87.23% since the patterns are more clearly sep-
arable compared to Test A (annoyed vs. non-
angry, 72.57%). Obviously, adding non-acoustic
features increases classification accuracy signifi-
cantly, but only where the acoustic features are
not expressive enough. While the additional in-
formation increases the accuracy of the combined
angry+annoyed task by 2.3 % (Test A), it does
not advance the distinction between only angry vs.
non-angry (Test B).
5.1 Emotional History
One could expect, that the probability of
an angry/annoyed turn following another an-
gry/annoyed turn is rather high and that this in-
formation could be exploited. Thus, we further
included two features PrevEmotion and PrevPre-
vEmotion, taking into account the two previous
hand-labeled emotions in the dialogue discourse.
If they would contribute to the recognition pro-
cess, we would replace them by automatically la-
belled ones. All test results, however, did not im-
prove.
5.2 Ruleset Analysis
For a determination of the relevant features in the
non-acoustic feature set, we analyzed the ruleset
generated by the RuleLearner in Test A. Interest-
ingly, a dominant feature in the resulting ruleset is
?AudioDuration?. While shorter utterances were
assigned to non-angry (about <2s), longer utter-
ances tended to be assigned to angry/annoyed. A
following analysis of the utterance length confirms
this rule: utterances labeled as angry averaged
2.07 (+/-0.73) seconds, annoyed utterances lasted
1.82 (+/-0.57) s and non-angry samples were 1.57
(+/- 0.66) s in average. The number of NoMatch

events (CumNoMatch) up to the angry turn played
a less dominant role than expected: only 8 samples
were assigned to angry/annoyed due to reoccur-
ring NoMatch events (>5 NoMatchs). Utterances
that contained ?Operator?, ?Agent? or ?Help? were,
as expected, assigned to angry/annoyed, however,
in combination with high AudioDuration values
(>2s). Non-angry utterances were typically better
recognized: average ASR confidence values are
0.82 (+/-0.288) (non-angry), 0.71 (+/- 0.36) (an-
noyed) and 0.56 (+/- 0.41) (angry).
6 Conclusion and Discussion
In IVR systems, we can take advantage of non-
acoustic information, that comes from the dia-
logue context. As demonstrated in this work,
ASR, NLU, DM and contextual features sup-
port the distinction between angry and non-angry
callers. However, where the samples can be sepa-
rated into clear patterns, such as in Test B, no ben-
efit from the additional feature set can be expected.
In what sense a late fusion of linguistic, dialogue
and context features would improve the classifier,
i.e. by building various subsystems whose opin-
ions are subject to a voting mechanism, will be
evaluated in future work. We will also analyze
why the linguistic features did not have any vis-
ible impact on the classifier. Presumably a combi-
nation of n-grams, bag-of-words and bag of emo-
tional salience will improve classification.
