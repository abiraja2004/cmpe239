Abstract
This paper presents an original approach
to part-of-speech tagging of fine-grained
features (such as case, aspect, and adjec-
tive person/number) in languages such as
English where these properties are gener-
ally not morphologically marked.
The goals of such rich lexical tagging
in English are to provide additional fea-
tures for word alignment models in bilin-
gual corpora (for statistical machine trans-
lation), and to provide an information
source for part-of-speech tagger induction
in new languages via tag projection across
bilingual corpora.
First, we present a classifier-combination
approach to tagging English bitext with
very fine-grained part-of-speech tags nec-
essary for annotating morphologically
richer languages such as Czech and
French, combining the extracted fea-
tures of three major English parsers,
and achieve fine-grained-tag-level syntac-
tic analysis accuracy higher than any indi-
vidual parser.
Second, we present experimental results
for the cross-language projection of part-
of-speech taggers in Czech and French via
word-aligned bitext, achieving success-
ful fine-grained part-of-speech tagging of
these languages without any Czech or
French training data of any kind.
1 Introduction
Most prior research in part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging has focused on supervised learning over a
tagset such as the Penn Treebank tagset for En-
glish, which is restricted to features that are mor-
phologically distinguished in the focus language.
Thus the only verb person/number distinction made
in the Brown Corpus/Penn Treebank tagset is VBZ
(3rd-person-singular-present), with no correspond-
ing person/number distinction in other tenses. Sim-
ilarly, adjectives in English POS tagsets typically
have no distinctions for person, number or case be-
cause such properties have no morphological surface
distinction, although they do for many other lan-
guages.
This essential limitation of the Brown/Penn POS
subtag inventory to morphologically realized dis-
tinctions in English dramatically simplifies the prob-
lem by reducing the tag entropy per surface form
(the adjective tall has only one POS tag (JJ) rather
than numerous singular, plural, nominative, ac-
cusative, etc. variants), increasing both the stand-
alone effectiveness of lexical prior models and word-
suffix models for part-of-speech tagging.
However, for many multilingual applications, in-
cluding feature-based word alignment in bilingual
corpora and machine translation into morphologi-
cally richer languages, it is helpful to extract finer-
grained lexical analyses on the English side that
more closely parallel the morphologically realized
tagset of the second (source or target) language.
In particular, prior work on translingual part-of-
speech tagger projection via parallel bilingual cor-
pora (e.g. Yarowsky et al, 2001) has been limited
to inducing part-of-speech taggers in second lan-
guages (such as French or Czech) that only assign
tags at the granularity of their source language (i.e.
49
the Penn Treebank-granularity distinctions from En-
glish). The much richer English tagsets achieved
here can allow these tagger projection techniques to
transfer richer tag distinctions (such as case and verb
person/number) that are important to the full analy-
sis of these languages, using only bilingual corpora
with the morphologically impoverished English.
For quickly retargetable machine translation, the
primary focus of effort is overcoming the extreme
scarcity of resources for the low density source lan-
guage. Sparsity of conditioning events for a transla-
tion model can be greatly reduced by the availabil-
ity of automatic source-language analysis. In this
research we attempt to induce models for the au-
tomatic analysis of morphological features such as
case, tense, number, and polarity in both the source
and target languages with this end in mind.
2 Prior Work
2.1 Fine-grained part-of-speech tagging
Most prior work in fine-grained part-of-speech tag-
ging has been limited to languages such as Czech
(e.g. Hajic? and Hladka?, 1998) or French (e.g. Fos-
ter etc.) where finer-grained tagset distinctions are
morphologically marked and hence natural for the
language. In support of supervised tagger learn-
ing of these languages, fine-trained tagset inven-
tories have been developed by the teams above
at Charles University (Czech) and Universite? de
Montre?al (French). The tagset developed by Hajic?
forms the basis of the distinctions used in this paper.
The other major approach to fine-grained tagging
involves using tree-based tags that capture grammat-
ical structure. Bangalore and Joshi (1999) have uti-
lized ?supertags? based on tree-structures of various
complexity in the tree-adjoining grammar model.
Using such tags, Brants (2000) has achieved the au-
tomated tagging of a syntactic-structure-based set of
grammatical function tags including phrase-chunk
and syntactic-role modifiers trained in supervised
mode from a treebank of German.
2.2 Classifier combination for part-of-speech
tagging
There has been broad work in classifier combination
at the tag-level for supervised POS tagging mod-
els. For example, Ma`rquez and Rodr??guez (1998)
have performed voting over an ensemble of decision
tree and HMM-based taggers for supervised En-
glish tagging. Murata et al (2001) have combined
neural networks, support vector machines, decision
lists and transformation-based-learning approaches
for Thai part-of-speech tagging. In each of these
cases, annotated corpora containing the full tagset
granularity are required for supervision.
Henderson and Brill (1999) have approached
parsing through classifier combination, using bag-
ging and boosting for the performance-weighted
voting over the parse-trees from three anonymous
statistical phrase-structure-based parsers. However,
as their switching and voting models assumed equiv-
alent phrase-structure conventions for merger com-
patibility, it is not clear how a dependency parsing
model or other divergent syntactic models could be
integrated into this framework. In contrast, the ap-
proach presented below can readily combine syntac-
tic analyses from highly diverse parse structure mod-
els by first projecting out all syntactic analyses onto
a common fine-grained lexical tag inventory.
2.3 Projection-based Bootstrapping
Yarowsky et al (2001) performed early work in the
cross-lingual projection of part-of-speech tag anno-
tations from English to French and Czech, by way of
word-aligned parallel bilingual corpora. They also
used noise-robust supervised training techniques to
train stand-alone French and Czech POS taggers
based on these projected tags. Their projected
tagsets, however, were limited to those distinctions
captured in the English Penn treebank inventory,
and hence failed to make many of the finer grained
distinctions traditionally assumed for French and
Czech POS tagging, such as verb person, number,
and polarity and noun/adjective case.
Probst (2003) pursued a similar methodology for
the purposes of tag projection, using a somewhat
expanded tagset inventory (e.g. including adjec-
tive number but not case), and focusing on target-
language monolingual modeling using morpheme
analysis. Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003) addressed
the problem of grammatical gender projection via
the use of small seed sets based on natural gender.
Another distinct body of work addresses the prob-
lem of parser bootstrapping based on syntactic de-
pendency projection (e.g. Hwa et al 2002), often
using approaches based in synchronous parsing (e.g.
Smith and Smith, 2004).

3 Tagsets
We use Penn treebank-style part-of-speech tags as
a substrate for further enrichment (for all of the ex-
periments described here, text was first tagged us-
ing the fnTBL part-of-speech tagger (Ngai and Flo-
rian, 2001)). Each Penn tag is mapped to a core
part-of-speech tag, which determines the set of fine-
grained tags further applicable to each word. The
fine-grained tags applicable to nouns, verbs, and ad-
jective are shown in Table 1. This paper concentrates
on these most important core parts-of-speech.
The example English sentence in Figure 1 illus-
trates several key points about our tagset. Some of
the information we are interested in is already ex-
pressed by the Penn-style tags ? the NN titles is plu-
ral; the VBD were is in the past tense. For these, our
goal is simply to make these facts explicit.
On the other hand, curious could also be meaning-
fully said to be semantically plural, and most impor-
tantly for us, the corresponding word in a translation
of this sentence into many other languages would
be morphologically plural. Similarly, the head verb
provoking is also semantically in the past tense, and
is likely to be translated to a past-tense form in many
languages, even though in this example the actual
tense marking is on were. We expect the ?past-
ness? of the action to be much more stable cross-
linguistically, than the particular division of labor
between the head word and the auxiliary. By prop-

agating these features from where they are explicit
to where they are not, we hope to make information
more directly available for projection. Another im-
portant class of information we would like to make
available concerns syntactic relations, which many
languages mark with morphological case. This is an
issue that involves deep, complex, and ambiguous
mappings, which we are not yet prepared to treat in
their fullness. For now, we observe that curious and
titles are both dominated by with.
Because of intent to mark whatever information
is recoverable, some of our tags require some in-
terpretation. For example, English has little or no
morphological realization of syntactic case, but the
essential information of case, relationship of a noun
with its governor, is recoverable from contextual
information, so we defined it in these terms. To
avoid loss of information, we chose to remain ag-
nostic about deeper analyses, such as the identifi-
cation of theta roles or predicate-argument relation-
ships, and restricted ourselves to a direct represen-
tation of surface relationships. We identified sub-
jects, direct and indirect objects, non-heads of noun
compounds, possessives, and temporal adjuncts, and
created a distinct tag for the objects of each distinct
preposition.
Our ideal would be to have as expansive and de-
tailed a tagset as possible, a ?quasi-universal? tagset
which could cover whatever set of distinctions might
be relevant for any language onto which we might

Figure 3: Examples of locally recoverable features
project our analysis. A completely universal tagset
would require that the morphological distinctions
made by the world?s languages come from a limited
pool of possibilities, based on non-arbitrary seman-
tic distinctions, and further would require that the
relevant semantic information be recoverable from
English text. The tagset we are using now is shaped
in part by exceptions to these conditions. For ex-
ample, we have put off implementing tagging of
gender given the notoriously arbitrary and inconsis-
tent assignment of grammatical gender across lan-
guages (although Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2003)
were able to show success on projection-based anal-
ysis of grammatical gender as well).
In the end, we have settled on a set of distinc-
tions very similar to those realized by the morpho-
logically richer of the European languages, with the
noticeable absence of gender. Table 1 describes the
features we chose on this basis (definiteness and
mood features were developed for English but not
projected to French or Czech, and are not treated in
this paper).
4 Methods ? English Tagging
The features we tagged vary widely in their degree
of morphological versus syntactic marking, and the
difficulty of their monolingual English detection.
For some, tagging is simply a matter of explicitly
separating information contained in the Penn part-
of-speech tags, while others can be tagged to a high
degree of accuracy with simple heuristics based on
local word and part-of-speech tag patterns. These
include number for nouns and adjectives, person
(trivially) for nouns, degree for adjectives, polarity,
voice, and aspect (perfectivity and progressivity) for
verbs, as well as tense for some verbs. Figure 3
shows example rules for some of these easier cases.
The more difficult features are those whose de-
tection requires some degree of syntactic analysis.
These include case, which summarizes the relation
of each noun with its governor, and the agreement-
based features: we define person, number, and case
for attributive adjectives by agreement with their
head nouns, number and person for verbs and predi-
cate adjectives by agreement with their subjects, and
tense for some verbs by agreement with their in-
flected auxiliaries.
We investigated four individual approaches for
the syntax-features ? a regular-expression-based
quasi-parser, a system based on Dekang Lin?s Mini-
Par (Lin, 1993), a system based on the Collins parser
(Collins, 1999), and one based on the CMU Link
Grammar Parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993),
as well as a family of voting-based combination
schemes.
4.1 Regular-expression Quasi-parser
The regular-expression ?quasi-parser? takes a direct
approach, using several dozen heuristics based on
regular-expression-like patterns over words, Penn
part-of-speech tags, and the output of the fnTBL
noun chunker. Use of the noun chunker fa-
cilitates identification of noun/dependent relation-
ships within chunks, and extends the range of pat-
terns identifying noun/governor relationships across
chunks.
The output of the quasi-parser consists of two
parts: a case tag for each noun in a sentence, and
a set of agreement links across which other features
are then spread. We call this a direct approach be-
cause the links are defined operationally, directly in-
dicating the spreading action, rather than represent-
ing any deeper syntactic analysis.
In the diagram of the example sentence below, an
arrow from one word to another indicates that the
former takes features from the latter. The example
also shows the context patterns by which the nouns
in the sentence receive case.

4.2 MiniPar and the CMU Link Grammar
Parser
For MiniPar, the Collins parser, and the CMU
link grammar parser, we developed for each a set
of minimal-complexity heuristics to transform the
parser output into the specific conceptions of depen-
dency and case we had developed for the first pass.
52
MiniPar produces a labeled dependency graph,
which yields a straightforward extraction of the in-
formation needed for this task. Case tagging is a
simple matter of mapping the set of dependency la-
bels to our case inventory. Our agreement links
are almost a subset of MiniPar?s dependencies (with
some special treatment of subject/auxiliary/main-
verb triads, as shown in the example sentence).
The figure below presents MiniPar?s raw output
for the example sentence, along with some exam-
ple dependency-label/case-tag rules. The agreement
links extracted from the dependency graph are iden-
tical (in this case) to those produced by the regular-
expression quasi-parser.

The output of the CMU link grammar parser has
properties similar to MiniPar, and thus tag extraction
was handled in a similar fashion.
4.3 Collins Parser
The Collins Parser produces a Penn-Treebank-style
constituency tree, with head labels. Although we
could have used the head-labels to operate on the
dependency graph as with MiniPar, we chose to con-
centrate on addressing the weakest point of our pre-
vious systems, the identification of case. Our algo-
rithm traces the path from each noun to the root of
the tree, stopping at the first node which we judged
to reliably indicate case.
We did not directly extract any further informa-
tion from the Collins parser output. Instead, the
remainder of the system is identical to the regular-
expression quasi-parser. However, because the sys-
tem uses nominative case to identify verb sub-
jects, we did expect to see some improvements in
agreement-based features as well.

4.4 Parser Combination
The fine-grained taggers based on the four partic-
ipating parsers exhibited significant differences in
their strengths and weaknesses, suggesting poten-
tial benefit from combining them. Lacking tag-level
numerical scores and development data for weight-
training, we restricted ourselves to simple voting
mechanisms. We chose to do all of the combinations
at the end of the process, voting separately on tags
for specific features of specific words. Without tag-
level probabilities from the one-best parser outputs,
we were still able to use the combination protocols
to achieve a coarse-grained confidence measure.
We compared a series of seven combination pro-
tocols of increasing leniency to investigate preci-
sion/recall tradeoffs. The strictest, ?4:0?, produces
an output only when there are four votes for the fa-
vored tag, and no votes for any other. Analogously,
protocols ?3:0?, ?2:0? and ?1:0? also allow no dissent,
but allow progressively more abstentions. Continu-
ing the sequence, protocol ?2:1? proposes a tag as
long as there is a clear majority, ?2:2? as long as sup-
porters are not outnumbered by dissenters, and ?1:3?
whenever possible. To break ties in the latter two
protocols, we favored first the CMU Link Parser,
then Collins, then MiniPar, then Regexp. (Lacking
sufficient labeled data for fine-tuning, we ordered
them arbitrarily.)
5 Evaluation of English POS Tagging
Before we began the development of our taggers, we
created standard tagging guidelines, and hand anno-
tated a 3013-word segment of the English side of the
Canadian Hansards, to be used for evaluation.

Figure 5: Precision versus Recall ? Verb number
Table 2 shows system accuracy on test data in
a forced-choice evaluation, where abstentions were
replaced by the most common tag for the each situa-
tion (the combination system is that one biased most
heavily towards recall.)
In addition to the individual features, we also list
?pseudo-French? and ?pseudo-Czech?. These rep-
resent exact-match accuracies for composite fea-
tures comprising those features typically realized in
French or Czech POS taggers. For example, pseudo-
Czech verb accuracy of 67.1% indicates that for
67.1% of verb instances, the Czech-realized features
of number, tense, perfectivity, progressivity, polar-
ity, and voice were all correct. These give an indica-
tion of the quality of the starting point for crosslin-
gual bootstrapping to the respective languages.
Besides the forced-choice scenario, we were also
interested in the effect of allowing abstentions for
low-confidence cases. Table 3 shows the F-measure
of precision and recall for the individual systems, as
well as a range of combination systems. Figures 4
and 5 show (for two example features) the clear pre-
cision/recall tradeoff. Performance of the consensus
systems is higher than the individual parser-based
taggers at all levels of tag precision or recall.
Unfortunately, because MiniPar does its own inte-
grated tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, we
found that a significant portion of the errors seemed
to stem from discrepancies where MiniPar disagreed
on the segmentation or the core part-of-speech of the
words in question.
6 Cross-lingual POS Tag Projection and
Bootstrapping
Our cross-lingual POS tag projection process is sim-
ilar to Yarowsky et al (2001). It begins by perform-
ing a statistical sentence and word alignment of the
bilingual corpora (described below), and then trans-
fers both the coarse- and fine-grained tags achieved
from classifier combination on the English side via
the higher confidence word alignments (based on the
intersection of the 1-best word alignments induced
from French to English and English to French. The
projected tags then serve as noisy monolingual train-
ing data in the source language.
There are several notable differences and exten-
sions: The first major difference is that the projected
fine-grained tag set is much more detailed, including
such additional properties as noun case, adjective
54
case and number, and verb person, number, voice,
and polarity. Because these span the subtag features
normally assumed for Czech and French part-of-
speech taggers, the projection work presented here
for the first time shows the translingual projection
and induction of full-granularity Czech and French
taggers, rather than the much less complete and
coarser-grained prior projection work.
The other major differences are in the method
of target-language monolingual tagger generaliza-
tion from the projected tags. We pursue a combi-
nation of trie-based lexical prior models and local-
agreement-based context models. The lexical prior
trie model, as illustrated in Figure 6 for noun num-
ber, shows how the hierarchically-smoothed lexical
prior conditioned on variable length suffixes can as-
sign noun number probabilities to both previously
seen words (with full-word-length suffixes stored)
and to new words in test data, based on backoff to
partially matching suffixes.
The context models are based on exploiting agree-
ment phenomena of the fine-grained tag features in
local context.  
	 	ff	flfi for each word
token is a distance-weighted linear interpolation of
the posterior tag distributions assigned to its neigh-
bors by the trie-based lexical-prior model. Finally
  subtag  word fi is an equally-weighted linear inter-
polation of the   subtag  affix fi trie model probabil-
ity and   subtag  context fi context-agreement prob-
ability. Table 4 contrasts the performance of these
two models in isolation and combination.
All of these models condition their probabilities
first on the core part-of-speech of a word. We used
the methods of Yarowsky et al (2001) to develop
a core part-of-speech tagger for French, based only
on the projected core tags, and used this as a basis
for fine-grained tags. We also ran experiments iso-
lating the question of fine-grained tagging, assuming
as input externally supplied core tags from the gold-
standard data. Table 4 shows results under both of
these assumptions.
For French, the training data was 15 million
words from the Canadian Hansards. Word align-
ments were produced using GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2000) set to produce a maximum of one English
word link for each French word (i.e., a French-to-
English model). The test data was 111,000 words of
text from the Laboratoire de Recherche Applique?e
en Linguistique Informatique at the Universite? de
Montre?al, annotated with person, number, and tense.

Several factors contributed to a fairly successful
set of results. The quality of the alignments is sub-
jectively very good; the morphological system of
French is relatively simple, and is a good match for
our suffix tries; Perhaps most importantly, the map-
pings between the English and the French tagsets
were for the most part simple and consistent. The
most prominent exception is verb tense.
For Czech, the training and testing data were from
the Reader?s Digest corpus. We used the first 63,000
words for testing, and the remaining 551,000 for
training, ignoring the translations of the test data and
the gold-standard tags on the training data.
It should be noted that the baseline (most likely
tag) performance is actually a supervised model us-
ing the target language monolingual goldstandard
data frequencies. The other results based on translin-
gual projection have no knowledge of the true most
likely tag, and hence occasionally underperform this
supervised ?baseline?. Finally, one of the major rea-
sons for lower Czech performance is the currently
very poor quality of the bilingual word alignments.
However, using these diverse POS subtags as fea-
tures offers the potential for substantially improved
word alignment for morphologically rich languages,
one of the central downstream benefits of this re-
search.
7 Conclusion
We have demonstrated the feasibility of automati-
cally annotating English text with morphosyntactic
information at a much finer POS tag granularity than
in the standard Brown/Penn tagset, but at a POS de-
tail appropriate for tagging morphologically richer
language such as Czech or French. This is accom-
plished by using a classifier combination strategy to
integrate the analyses of four independent parsers,
achieving a consensus tagging with higher accuracy
than the best component parser.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the re-
sulting fine-grained POS tags can be successfully
