ALGOKITHMISATION OF LINGUISTIC RESEARCH 
USING THE STRUCTURAL-PROBABILISTIC 
PROPERTIES OF LANGUAGE UNITS 
First of all, I must confess that the algorithmisation i  question is 
only a by-product of the structural-probabilistic analysis, whose main 
and openly immodest purpose is to re-write anew the whole book of 
language theory, and especially of its development. 
Nevertheless, the algorithmisation of linguistic research, both par- 
tial and in full, is feasible, and has already been done in dozens of exper- 
iments during the last 15 years. This algorithmisation is essentially 
based upon the assumption that quantitative characteristics are an 
inherent part of the language structure. 
In order to prove this hypothesis, let us consider the so-called 
"intuitive statistics ": first, its facts, then their theoretical interpret- 
at\]on.

If you ask a Russian man in the street, what series of words would 
be easier to prolong, the upper or the lower one, nine times out often 
(or, better to say, 99 times out of 100), he gives a quick and correct 
answer. 
And how to interprete this well-verified and therefore undeniable 
fact? Does this knowledge, belonging to the man in the street, consti- 
tute a part of the language structure inside his brain, or is it something 
beyond that structure?

TABLE 2. 
I. PALEONTOLOGY,  SUN, SOUP, .... 
II. EVENT(S),  CLOUD(S), VEGETABLE(S),., . .  
Now let us turn to such a simple case as plural form of nouns. Of 
course, it is possible to say: the planet of two suns, these two soups are 
incompatible, the distinguished professors do have different paleontologies, but 
all these cases are rarities of the kind, and we know the fact without 
any count. 
On the other hand, the plurals of the second group are quite com- 
mon, and occur as often as (or even more frequently) than their respec- 
tive singulars. Consequendy, every native speaker of English feels the 
difference between class I and class n, once more not having counted 
anything at all.

Psycholinguistic experiments prove that a man, sufficiently mature, 
has a probabilistic ladder in his mind, on the five steps of which not 
only the life situations, but also language phenomena are disposed;

AWRA?~: Usually about 30 % of the whole set 
of noun occurences are plural. 
A. Singularia tantum 
B. Predominantly singular class (1-10 %) 
C. Average class (20 %-40 %) 
D. Predominantly plural class (50 %-90 %) 
E. Pluralia tantum 
ALGORITHMISATION OF LINGUISTIC RESEARCH 157 
Returning to the singulars and plurals, we may observe that there 
exists a probabilistic scale of nouns which divides all of them into five 
groups, according to their respective proportions between plural and 
singular forms. 
Thus we have come closely to the conceptions of categorial measure 
and its classifying role. The figures in the table 4 express the categ- 
orial measure of plurality; of course it could be done in terms of 
singularity. 
The short time, which is at my disposal, does not permit me to supply 
you with strict mathematical definitions, the latter being too compli- 
cated to be understandable at first glance. 
T~r~E 5. 
Any strong governing is a case of high categorial 
measure (CM), e.g. : 
Verb CM Class 
LOVE 0.98 4. (High transitivity) 
KNOW 0.51 3. (Middle t.) 
WORK 0.02 2. (Low t.) 
LAUGH 0 1. (Intransitivity) 
Average factual occurrence of a direct object is 35 ~/o 
of factual verb occurrences in English texts. 
Traditional structural linguistics has already elaborated a conception 
which has some kinship to the notion of categorial measure; I mean the 
so-called "strong governing ". But the limits of the phenomenon have 
never been established, - at least, unanimously. 
Of course, the boundaries between classes 4,3,2,1, are not thin lines, 
they have some probabilistic thickness, but such is the very nature of 
the system of classes under consideration here.

These four classes are a clear case of a probabilistic 
distinctive f ature (PDF). Another one is represent- 
ed by the five classes based on the CM of plural- 
ity/singularity. 
Here we proceed to a more sophisticated notion of the correla- 
tional function which is defined as a ratio of the individual categorial 
measure of a processed linguistic unit to the average categorial 
measure. 
When the correhtional function is equal or near to 1, we have a 
typical representative of the set, whose properties are standard (or quasi- 
standard) from the considered point of view. 
If the CF substantially exceeds 1 (the boundary of substantiality 
is determined by factor analysis), then we have met a representative of 
an upper class (whatever its name). 
Last, if the CF is substantially ess than 1, then before us there is an 
item from a lower class. Sometimes, it is very important o make a 
distinction between the lower class and the zero class, as well as between 
the higher class and the absolute class. This particular situation may be 
found in the case of plurality/singularity. 
The categorial measure being the basis for the classification and for 
establishing oppositions, we come to the notion of probabilistic distinc- 
tive feature, which may be defined (without mathematical details and 
therefore not too strictly) as a feature generating quantitative differences,

and the latter ones, when strong and stable enough, may be defined as 
creating qualitative oppositions at the level of mental perception.

A case of probabilistic complementary distribution 
(PCD). 
Probabilistic distinctive features are not independent of each other. 
Of course, it is not oflqcially forbidden to say: 
I know him, and his habits, and his wish to do it exactly as usual, and 
that he never would do it another way, 
but such examples are very rare. For all practical purposes, we may con- 
sider transitivity and commentabilitity as nearly absolutely excluding each 
other. By the way, it is wrong to interpret he latter as a particular 
case of the former; English to hope, French esp3rer, German hoffen, and 
Russian HA~EFITbCH, - they all are intransitive, and at the same time 
commentable, which proves the point. 
So, when the possibility of simultaneous realisation of two (or more) 
PDF's is near to zero (or equal to), then we have the right to speak 
about a probabilistic omplementary distribution.

A heuristic task: to investigate the (English)verb and to dis- 
cover PCD's, as many cases as possible. 
A Routine For Rs Solution 
1. Fix all the factual syntactic links of verbs in a given corpus 
of texts. 
2. Find the average CM for each type of link. 
3. Sort out a prescribed quantity of the most frequent verbs 
in each type of link. 
4. Measure the CF's, i.e. the individual values of them for each 
verb sorted out, thus establishing the PDF's. 
5. Correlate the PDF values considering them as components 
of a multi-dimensional vector. 
6. Dine well if you have found a new case of a PCD: it's rarer 
than a wife who neglects a new vogue more often than 
once a year. 
It may be easily seen, that all the procedures included in the set of 
routines admit algorithmisation and subsequent computerisation (ex- 
cept number 6, for obvious reasons).
