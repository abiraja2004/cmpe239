Abstract
In this paper we present a semantic role la-
beling system submitted to the task Multi-
level Semantic Annotation of Catalan and
Spanish in the context of SemEval?2007.
The core of the system is a memory?based
classifier that makes use of full syntactic in-
formation. Building on standard features,
we train two classifiers to predict separately
the semantic class of the verb and the seman-
tic roles.
1 Introduction
Semantic role labelling (SRL) has been addressed
in the CoNLL?2004 and CoNLL?2005 Shared
Tasks (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004; Carreras and
Ma`rquez, 2005) for English. In the task Multilevel
Semantic Annotation of Catalan and Spanish of the
SemEval competition 2007, the target are two differ-
ent languages. The general SRL task consists of two
tasks: prediction of semantic roles (SR) and predic-
tion of the semantic class of the verb (SC).
The data provided in the task (Ma`rquez et al,
2007) are sentences annotated with lemma, POS
tags, syntactic information, semantic roles, and the
semantic classes of the verb. A training corpus for
Catalan (ca.3LB) and another for Spanish (sp.3LB)
are provided. Although the setting is similar to
the CoNLL?Shared Task 2005, three relevant differ-
ences are that the corpora are significantly smaller,
that the syntactic information is based on a manu-
ally corrected treebank, which contains also syntac-
tic functions (i.e. direct object, indirect object, etc.),
and that the set of semantic roles is larger, especially
for core arguments.
Our goal is to check whether simple individual
systems could produce competitive results in both
subtasks, and whether they would be robust enough
when applied to two languages and to the held?out
test sets provided.
2 System description
We approach the SRL task as two classification
problems: prediction of SR and prediction of SC.
We hypothesize that the two problems can be solved
in the same way for both languages. We build two
very similar systems that differ only in some of the
features used, as we explain below.
The task is solved in three phases: 1) A pre?
processing phase that is very similar to the sequen-
tialization in (Ma`rquez et al, 2005). We call it focus
selection. It consists of identifying the potential can-
didates to be assigned a semantic role or a semantic
verb class. 2) The classification. 3) Some limited
postprocessing.
2.1 Focus selection
The system starts by finding the target verb (which
is marked in the corpus as such). Then, it finds
the complete form of the verb (that in the corpus is
tagged as verb group, infinitive, gerund, etc.) and
the clause boundaries in order to look for the siblings
of the verb that are under the same clause. Our as-
sumption is that all siblings of the verb are potential
candidates for semantic roles. The focus selection
process produces two groups of focus tokens: on the
one hand, the verbs and, on the other, the siblings of
183
the verbs. These tokens will be the instances in each
training set. Table 1 shows the number of training
and test instances for each subtask.

2.2 Classification
In both systems we approach the classification task
in one step, predicting directly the SR and the SC
class. This means that in the SR task we do not
perform a previous classification to select the tokens
that might be assigned a role. We assume that all
verbs belong to a class. As for the SR, we assume
that most siblings of the verb will have a class, ex-
cept for those that have syntactic functions AO, ET,
MOD, NEG, IMPERS, PASS, and VOC. The sib-
lings that do not have a semantic role are assigned
the NONE tag. Because the corpus is small and be-
cause the amount of instances with a NONE class is
proportionally low, we do not consider it necessary
to filter these cases.
Regarding the learning algorithm, we use the
IB1 classifier as implemented in TiMBL (version
5.1) (Daelemans et al, 2004), a supervised induc-
tive algorithm for learning classification tasks based
on the k nearest neighbor (k-nn) algorithm. In IB1,
similarity is defined by a feature?level distance met-
ric between a test instance and a memorized training
instance. The metric combines a per?feature value?
based distance metric with global feature weights
that account for relative differences in importance
of the features.
The TiMBL parameters used in the systems are
the IB1 algorithm, the Jeffrey Divergence as feature
metric, MVDM threshold at level 1, weighting us-
ing GainRatio, k=11, and weighting neighbors as
function of their Inverse Linear Distance (for details
we refer the reader to the TiMBL reference guide
(Daelemans et al, 2004)).
As for the features, we started by using the same
feature set for both classifiers and then, after some
experimentation, we decided to use slightly differ-
ent feature sets for the two sub-tasks. Most of the
features we designed are features that have become
standard for the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez,
2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005). In our system,
the features relate to the verb, the verb siblings, what
we take to be the content word of the siblings, the
clause, and the relation verb?arguments. Addition-
ally, we added lexical features extracted from the
verb lexicon provided for the task, and from Word-
Net.
After experimenting with 323 features, we se-
lected 98 for the SR task and 77 for the SC subclass.
In order to select the features, we started with a basic
system, the results of which were used as a baseline.
Every new feature that was added to the basic system
was evaluated in terms of average accuracy in 10-
fold cross-validation experiments; if it improved the
performance on held-out data, it was added to the se-
lection. One problem with this hill-climbing method
is that the selection of features is determined by the
order in which the features have been introduced.
We also performed experiments applying the feature
selection process reported in (Tjong Kim Sang et al,
2005), a bi-directional hill climbing process. How-
ever, experiments with this advanced method did not
produce a better selection of features.
The features for the SR prediction subtask are the
following:
? Features on the verb (6). They are shared by all
the instances that represent phrases belonging to the
same clause:
VForm; VLemma; VCau: binary feature that indicate if the
verb is in a causative construction with hacer, fer or if the main
verb is causar; VPron, VImp, VPass: binary features that indi-
cate if the verb is pronominal, impersonal, and in passive form
respectively.
? Features on the sibling in focus (12):
SibSynCat: syntactic category; SibSynFunc: syntactic
function; SibPrep: preposition; SibLemW1, SibPOSW1,
SibLemW2, SibPOSW2, SibLemW3, SibPOSW3: lemma
and POS tag of the first, second and third words of the sibling;
SibRelPos: position of the sibling in relation to the verb (PRE
or POST); Sib+1RelPos: position of the sibling next to the cur-
rent phrase in relation to the verb (PRE or POST); SibAbsPos:
absolute position of the sibling in the clause.
? Features that describe the properties of the content
word (CW) of the focus sibling (13): in the case of
prepositional phrases the CW is the head of the first
noun phrase; in cases of coordination, we only take
the first element of the coordination.
184
CWord; CWLemma; CWPOS: we take only the first char-
acter of the POS tags provided; CWPOSType: the type of
POS, second character of the POS tags provided; CWGender;
CWne: binary feature that indicates if the CW is a named en-
tity; CWtmp, CWloc: binary features that indicate if the CW
is a temporal or a locative adverb respectively; CW+2POS,
CW+3POS: POS of the second and third words after CW.
CWwnsc1, CWwnsc2, CWwnsc3: additionally, if the CW
is a noun, we extract information from WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) about the first, second, and third more frequent seman-
tic classes of the CW in WordNet. We cannot decide on a sin-
gle one because the corpus is not disambiguated. The seman-
tic class corresponds to the lexicographer files in WN3.0. For
nouns there are 25 file numbers.
? Features on the clause (24):
CCtot: total number of siblings with function CC (cir-
cumstancial complement); SUJRelPos, CAGRelPos, CDRel-
Pos, CIRelPos, ATRRelPos, CPREDRelPos, CREGRelPos:
relative positions of siblings with functions SUJ, CAG, CD,
CI,ATR, CPRED, and CREG in relation to verb (PRE or
POST); SEsib: binary feature that indicates if the clause con-
tains a verbal se; SIBtot: total number of verb siblings in
the clause; SynFuncSib8, SynCatSib8, PrepSib8,W1Sib8,
W2Sib8, W3Sib8, W4Sib8, SynFuncSib9, SynCatSib9,
PrepSib9, W1Sib9, W2Sib9, W3Sib9, W4Sib9: syntactic
function, syntactic category, preposition, and first to fourth
word of siblings 8 and 9.
? Features extracted from the lexicon of verbal
frames (43) that the task organizers provided. We
access the lexicon to check if it is possible for a verb
to have a certain semantic role. We check it for all
semantic role classes, except for ArgX-Ag, ArgX-
Cau, ArgX-Pat, ArgX-Tem because they proved not
to be informative. The features are binary.
For the SC prediction task the features are similar,
but not exactly the same. Both systems contain some
features about all candidate arguments. We point out
the differences:
? Features that are in the SR system and that are not
in the SC system:
Verb form (VForm), verb lemma (VLemma), absolute po-
sition of the sibling in the clause (SibAbsPos), function of
the sibling (SibSynFunc), preposition of the sibling (SibPrep),
POS tag of the second and third words after CW (CW+2POS,
CW+3POS), information about the WN classes of the CW
(CWwnsc1, CWwnsc2, CWwnsc3), feature about the CW be-
ing a named entity (CWne, SIBtot), syntactic function, syn-
tactic category, preposition and first to fourth word of sib-
lings 8 and 9 (SynFuncSib8, SynCatSib8, PrepSib8,W1Sib8,
W2Sib8, W3Sib8, W4Sib8, SynFuncSib9, SynCatSib9,
PrepSib9, W1Sib9, W2Sib9, W3Sib9, W4Sib9).
? Features that are only in the SC system:
AllCats: vector of the syntactic categories of the siblings in
the order that they appear in the clause; AllFuncs: vector of the
functions of the siblings in the order that they appear; AllFuncs-
Bin vector with eight binary values that represent if a sibling
with that function is present or not; Sib+1Prep, Sib+2Prep:
prepositions of the two siblings after the verb.
2.3 Postprocessing
As for the postprocessing phase, it consists of six
simple rules to correct some basic errors in predict-
ing some types of ArgM arguments. It only applies
to the SR task. The rules are the following ones:
1. If prediction = ArgM?LOC, ArgM?MNR or ArgM?ADV,
and either {SibPrep = ?durante? or ?durant?}, or {SibSynCat =
sn and one of the WN semantic classes = 28}, then prediction =
ArgM-TMP.
2. If prediction = ArgM?LOC, ArgM?MNR or ArgM?ADV,
and CWLemma is a temporal adverb, then prediction = ArgM?
TMP.
3. If prediction = ArgM?TMP and one of the WN classes = 15,
then prediction = ArgM?LOC.
4. If prediction = ArgM?TMP, ArgM-MNR or ArgM-ADV, and
CWLemma = locative adverb, then prediction = ArgM-LOC.
5. If prediction = ArgM-TMP or ArgM-ADV, and CWwnsc1 =
15, and SibPrep = ?en? or ?desde? or ?hacia? or ?a? or ?des de?
or ?cap a?, then prediction = ArgM?LOC.
6. If prediction = ArgM?ADV and CWLemma = causal con-
junction, then prediction = ArgM?CAU.
We are aware of the fact that these are very simple
rules and that more elaborate postprocessing tech-
niques can be applied, like the ones used in (Tjong
Kim Sang et al, 2005) in order to make sure that the
same role was not predicted more than once in the
same clause.

3 Results
The overall official results of the system are shown
in Table 2. The SC system performs better (over-
all F1 = 86.46) than the SR system (overall F1 =
83.78). In global, the systems perform better for
Catalan (overall F1 = 85.24) than for Spanish (over-
all F1 = 84.04), although the SC system performs
better for Catalan (89.37 vs. 86.46), and the SR sys-
tem performs better for Spanish (84.14 vs 83.40).
Striking results are that the SR system gets signif-
icantly better results with the held?out test for Span-
ish, and that both of the complete SRL systems get
significantly better results with the held?out test for
Spanish. This might be due to differences in the pro-
cess of gathering and annotation of the corpus.

Table 3 shows detailed results on the Spanish
CESS?ECE corpus for the SR task. Low scores are
generally related to low frequency of the SR in the
training corpus, and high scores are related to high
frequency or to overt marking of the SR.
4 Conclusions
We have presented two memory?based SRL systems
that make use of full syntactic information and ap-
proach the tasks in three steps. Results show that
rather simple individual systems can produce com-
petitive results in both tasks, and that they are ro-
bust enough to be applied to two languages and to
the held?out test sets provided. Improvements of the
systems would consist in improving the focus selec-
tion step, and applying more elaborate techniques
for feature selection and postprocessing.
