VerbNet overview, extensions, mappings and applications 
(Karin Kipper Schuler, Anna Korhonen, Susan Brown) 
 
Abstract: 
The goal of this tutorial is to introduce and discuss VerbNet, a broad coverage verb lexicon 
freely available on-line. VerbNet contains explicit syntactic and semantic information for classes 
of verbs and has mappings to several other widely-used lexical resources, including WordNet, 
PropBank, and FrameNet.  Since its first release in 2005 VerbNet is being used by a large 
number of researchers as a means of characterizing verbs and verb classes.  
The first part of the tutorial will include an overview of the original Levin verb classification; 
introduce the main VerbNet components, such as thematic roles and syntactic and semantic 
representations, and present a comparison with other available lexical resources.  
During the second part of the tutorial, we will explore VerbNet extensions (how new classes 
were derived and created through manual and semi-automatic processes), and we will present 
on-going work on automatic acquisition of Levin-style classes in corpora. The latter is useful for 
domain-adaptation and tuning of VerbNet for real-world applications which require this.  
The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to discussing the current status of VerbNet; 
including recent work mapping to other lexical resources, such as PropBank, FrameNet, 
WordNet, OntoNotes sense groupings, and the Omega ontology.  We will also present changes 
designed to regularize the syntactic frames and to make the naming conventions more 
transparent and user friendly.  Finally, we will describe some applications in which VerbNet has 
been used.

Short biographical description of the presenters: 
Karin Kipper Schuler  
University of Colorado 
kipper@verbs.colorado.edu 
 
Karin Kipper Schuler received her PhD from the Computer Science Department of the 
University of Pennsylvania. Her primary research is aimed at the development and 
evaluation of large-scale computational lexical resources. During the past couple of 
years she worked for the Mayo Clinic where she was involved in applications related to 
bio/medical informatics including automatic extraction of named entities and relations 
from clinical data and development of knowledge models to guide this data extraction.  
 
Anna Korhonen 
University of Cambridge 
alk23@cam.ac.uk 
 
Anna Korhonen received her PhD from the Computer Laboratory of the University of 
Cambridge in the UK. Her research focuses mainly on automatic acquisition of lexical 
information from texts. She has developed techniques and tools for automatic lexical 
acquisition for English and other languages, and has used them to acquire large lexical 
resources , extend manually built resources, and help NLP application tasks (e.g. parsing, 
word sense disambiguation, information extraction) . She has applied the techniques to 
different domains (e.g. biomedical) and has also used them to advance on research in 
related fields (e.g. cognitive sciences).  
 
Susan Brown 
University of Colorado 
susan.brown@colorado.edu 
 
Susan Brown is currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the 
University of Colorado under Dr. Martha Palmer?s supervision. Susan?s research focuses 
on lexical ambiguity, especially as it pertains to natural language processing tasks.  Her 
research methodologies include psycholinguistic experimentation, corpus study, and 
annotation analysis.  She has also been involved in the development of large-scale 
lexical resources and the design and construction of a lexically based ontology.
