Abstract
Lexical resources are key components for
applications related to human language technology.
Various models of lexical resources have been
designed and implemented during the last twenty
years and the scientific community has now gained
enough experience to design a common standard at
an international level. This paper thus describes the
ongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF
(Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how it
can be concretely implemented for the design of an
on-line morphological resource for French in the
Morphalou project.
1 Introduction
Lexical resources play a crucial role in most
applications related to human language technology.
They may be used by both human readers and
automatic processors for a wide range of activities
that require an even wider variety of lexical
structures. Some applications may demand broad
linguistic coverage, where the word is the entry
point and all the possible senses are attached to
them, whereas other applications could require a
concept-based organization of the lexical data,
from which the relevant words (or terms) may be
derived. Some applications barely need more then
a simple list of words, whereas other may require a
precise morpho-syntactic, syntactic and semantic
description of the various lexical entries.
Furthermore, the huge cost of creating and
maintaining a lexical resource in any of these
domains requires that they should not be designed
in isolation but that they may potentially be linked
with one another for mutual enrichment.
As a consequence, we believe that there is a
strong need for more widely accepted methods for
specifying lexical structures, so that the conditions
under which the corresponding databases can
exchange data are precisely defined. Moreover, it
seems that enough knowledge has been gathered
across the years to contemplate the idea that such
technical principles and methods could be the
source of an international standard that would
preserve the possibility of both describing various
types of formats and ensuring interoperability
among them.
This paper will present such a methodology as
currently under discussion in the context of ISO
committee TC 37/SC 4 in its on-going project
called LMF (Lexical Markup Framework, which
will become the future ISO 24613 standard). This
international context also provides us with a
unique opportunity to experiment with these most
recent proposals in the context of the concrete
necessity to deploy an open morphological
dictionary for French (the Morphalou project). We
will centre the discussion here on mapping the
modelling principles that have been agreed upon so
far in the LMF project with the actual requirements
associated with the design of a morphological
lexicon, hoping that it may lead to similar activities
on lexical modelling in the future.
2 Standards for lexical resources
Before describing the ongoing standardization
efforts within the LMF project, it is essential to get
an idea of the actual background available to us in
lexical representation at large and see how LMF
may build upon, or rather receive input from, other
past or ongoing standardization activities.
Lexical structures can classically be viewed
according to the way they organize the relation
between words and senses: either senses are
considered as subdivisions of the lexical entry (the
semasiological view of lexical data, which is the
one usually applied in print dictionaries) or on the
contrary, it is assumed that words (or ?terms?) are
described as ways of expressing a priori concepts,
(the onomasiological view).
The onomasiological view has formed the basis
for most previous standardization efforts since it is
at the focus of many applied contexts. This trend
started quite a while ago when the first standards
for thesaurus representation were issued in the
documentary field (ISO 2788 and ISO 5964).
Those standards basically organize lexical matter
as hierarchies of terms (e.g. broader-narrower
terms), with the possibility of adding some basic
lexical information (e.g. equivalences). More
recently, the terminological field has provided
more elaborate standards within ISO committee
TC 37, starting from the definition of an initial
SGML/XML-based  represen ta t ion  for
terminologies (ISO 12200), and progressing on to
the design of a flexible platform for specifying
terminological structures (ISO 16642). The main
problem with the onomasiological view is that
even if it is well suited for providing homogeneous
lexical descriptions within an application domain,
it is hardly extensible when broader linguistic
coverage is required.
In contrast, the semasiological view allows an
exhaustive survey of lexical content for a given
language. In particular, it provides the basis for any
classical editorial (or print) dictionary, but the wide
variety of possible dictionary formats seems to
have hampered the development of international
standards in this domain. The two main initiatives
that can be cited here are on the one hand the ISO
1951 standard dedicated solely to the
representation of dictionary entries, and on the
other hand, the seminal work done within the TEI
1
on print dictionaries, which, even though it has
already been applied to some large scale projects
such as the OED
2
, the Deutsches W?rterbuch
3
 or
the Anglo-Norman dictionary
4
, has never been
considered by publishers in particular as a real
international standard. As a consequence, many
relevant projects such as the TLFi
5
 ( Dendien &
Pierrel, 2003) have designed their own proprietary
structure for the description of their lexical
archives.
If one moves away from classical dictionaries
proper and considers lexical resources dedicated to
the domain of NLP, there are numerous projects
that have worked toward the definition of
standardized lexical structures in the domain of
NLP (Multext for basic morphological lexica;
Genelex, Simple, Isle/Mile for complex
multilingual entries; OLIF 1&2 for translation
lexica, etc.), but none of them has lead to a
standard that reflects a wide international
consensus and that is effectively maintained by an
authoritative body.
From a more theoretical point of view, it has
been shown that such lexical structures can be
modelled as feature structures (Ide et ali, 1995;
Veronis & Ide, 1992), leading to inheritance
properties within entries (Ide et ali, 2000), as
partially implemented in the TEI Print Dictionary
chapter (Ide &Veronis, 1995). It has also been

shown that, with respect to describing the micro-
structure of such lexica, at least three
configurations are possible: 2-layered, 3-layered
and 7-layered models. In the 2-layered approach,
following Ferdinand de Saussure (1974), a word is
described by a signifier/signified pair, corres-
ponding to a morphological/semantic description.
The syntactic behaviour of the word is then
systematically attached to the semantic description.
This is the approach that has been retained for
LMF. In the 3-layer approach (Antoni-Lay et ali,
1994), a word is described by three units: a
morphological, a syntactic and a semantic unit as
in Genelex or Eagles. It should be noted that due to
the fact that the syntactic unit is a mandatory
connection between morphology and semantics,
such a model is necessarily heavy and complex. In
the 7-layered approach (Mel?cuk et ali, 1995), a
word is described by various units in surface
phonology, deep phonology, surface morphology,
deep morphology, surface syntax, deep syntax and
semantics. This approach imposes a heavy burden
on the lexical description task.
Let us stress here the necessity of guaranteeing
that the methods used to describe onomasiological
and semasiological structures shall not be
completely different, so that it is possible (as
required by industrial applications in particular) to
combine various kinds of lexical resources, but
also to open the way for lexical architectures to
combine concept-based and word-based
descriptions as evidenced in the EDR dictionary
6
,
the Papillon project
7
, or IBM?s TransLexis
resource.
3 The Lexical Markup Framework project
The LMF proposal, as currently being developed
in ISO committee TC 37/SC 4, is conceived as a
generic platform for the specification of lexical
structures at any level of linguistic description. As
such, it does not provide one single model, but
rather a mechanism by which implementers com-
bine elementary lexical subsystems to design
models that can be both as close as possible to their
needs and comparable to any other lexical models
based on the same principles and, possibly, on the
same components.
The underlying data model for LMF follows the
general principles of the linguistic annotation
scheme design stated in Ide & Romary, 2003 and
implemented in the context of ISO standard 16642
for the representation of terminological data
(Romary, 2001). Those principles provide a
mechanism for combining a given structural

 http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/
metamodel that informs the general organization of
a certain level of linguistic information (morpho-
logy, syntax, etc.) with elementary descriptors (so-
called data categories). Data categories reflect
basic linguistic concepts (e.g. /part of speech/,
/grammatical  number/, /paucal number/, etc.) and
allow for recording language-specific properties
independently of linguistic level specific models.
In order to share data categories within the
community, on-going work (in ISO/TC 37) is in
the process of deploying an on-line registry
8
 of
them, especially for use in conjunction with the
other standardization activities.
According to these principles, LMF consists of
the following elements:
? a core metamodel (i.e. the structural skeleton
shared by any linguistic description at the
lexical level);
? mechanisms for attaching lexical extensions
(see below) to the core metamodel in order to
build up more complex metamodels;
? mechanisms for selecting data categories used
for lexical description and for determining how
they relate to a metamodel;
? mechanisms for expressing any combination of
the core metamodel and data categories as
XML structures, i.e. by deciding to implement
a given data category (/gender/) as an XML
element rather than as an attribute and by
providing the corresponding vocabularies
(?gen?, ?gender?, ?genre?);
? methods for describing how to extend LMF to
analyze, design, and describe a variety of more
specific lexical resources.
As shown in Figure 1, the core metamodel of
LMF is organized as a purely hierarchical structure
built upon the following components:
The Lexical database component gathers up all
information related to a given lexicon;
The Global information component groups
together all the metadata  (e.g. version,
contributors, up-date, etc.) that can be globally
attached to the lexicon (see 4.4);
The Lexical entry component comprises the
elementary lexical unit in a lexical database. This
component can, of course, be iterated, but no
specific constraint is expressed as to  its level of
granularity in a lexical database (e.g. proper
treatment of homonyms), since this depends highly
on languages and local editorial practices;
The Form component groups together all the
general graphical or phonetic descriptions attached
to the lexical entry (reference orthographic form,
transliteration, hyphenation, pronunciation, etc.);
                                                       
8
 An experimental on-line data category registry is
accessible under http://syntax.loria.fr
Finally, the Sense component is the one that
actually organizes the lexical entry since it can be
both repeated and further subdivided into senses.
In a word-to-sense lexical structure, it is indeed
thought that this central way of organizing a lexical
entry should be part of the metamodel.

Figure 1: Core model and lexical extensions in LMF
In order to specify more complex models than
would be expressible with just the core metamodel,
LMF introduces the notion of lexical extensions.
Those extensions correspond to clusters of com-
ponents dedicated to the representation of a
specific type of lexical information (e.g. morpho-
logy, syntactic constructions, transfer patterns
(socalled interlingua), and theory dependant lexi-
cographical approaches such as Mel?cuk et al
1995 or V?ronis, 2000). Each lexical extension is
characterized by an anchor component, which is
either a component of the core metamodel or of
another lexical extension when more complex
combinations are being considered (e.g. descrip-
tion of morphological operations used to extend a
simple morphological lexical extension).
The future LMF standard as such should not
provide a specific list of data categories to be used
for lexical descriptions. This would by far be too
complex given, as we have seen, the potential
variety of applications. It is thus expected that
implementers will systematically refer to the
ISO/TC 37 data category registry to find the
adequate descriptive background for their own
purposes. Still, we can outline the basic types of
data categories that one could encounter in an LMF
based application, namely:
? data categories that may be considered as
rather specific to the domain of lexical
description: these are typically those attached
to the Form component (/pronunciation/,
/syllabification/, /stress pattern/ etc.) or to the
Sense component (e.g. /definition/, /example/,
/etymology/, etc.). Some of these categories
have already been partially described in the
?old? ISO 12620:1999 standard, but a more
precise list should be compiled as the work on
LMF is being completed;
? data categories that relate to a specific level of
linguistic description such as morphology, syn-
tax, etc. The strategy here is to avoid defining
ad hoc descriptors dedicated to lexical struc-
tures and to enforce coherence with other stan-
dardization activities by adopting those asso-
ciated with the development of related stan-
dards. For instance, data categories such as
/grammatical category/, /grammatical gender/
or /grammatical case/ should be shared
between POS tagging applications and corres-
ponding lexical descriptions;
? data categories corresponding to metadata des-
criptors used to document the production and
maintenance of a lexical database, a lexical
entry and probably, of any component in a
lexical structure (see 4.4).
To conclude this brief presentation of LMF,
which can only be considered to be a snapshot of
the ongoing discussions about it, it is important to
consider how it provides a whole standardization
spectrum for implementers who will want to apply
it for their own purposes. At a first level, they can
limit themselves to the core model, to standardized
lexical extensions and to the data categories that
are available in the DCR. Doing so, they will have
the certainty of being fully interoperable with any
other implementation that has adopted the same
scope. If necessary, it is possible for implementers
to define some proprietary data categories or
maybe their own lexical extensions, knowing that
the corresponding part of their lexical model will
probably require more work if they wants to
interchange data with other applications. Still, such
a strategy is probably the optimal one in the
current stage of LMF, since, for instance, we do
not know yet which lexical extensions will be
sufficiently consensual to be further adopted as
international standards. This is indeed the spirit in
which the Morphalou project has been established,
i.e. to design a simple morphological lexical
extension to the LMF core principles and see how
it could be validated when confronted with the real
development of a lexical resource. In the long run,
we do expect that some combinations of the core
metamodel and some standardized lexical
extensions may also be seen as possible future
standards when they match specific industrial
needs (e.g. transfer lexica ? la OLIF) or existing
practices (e.g. TEI Print Dictionary format).
4 An LMF-based model for a morphological
lexicon
4.1 Requirements for a morphological lexicon
Morphological dictionaries typically associate
inflected word forms (for example plural nouns or
past tense verb forms) with values for relevant
morphological features, such as gender and num-
ber for adjectives or person and tense for verbs. In
addition, there is often a link to one particular word
form, conventionally chosen as being the lemma.
Those dictionaries are basic resources in the field
of NLP (needed for any application based on
tagged and/or lemmatized input data) and in the
field of computer-assisted language acquisition.
Most existing morphological resources for NLP
(MulText, V?ronis 1999; LEFFF
9
, Cl?ment &
Sagot) occur as text files, whose lines display the
inflected word form, one or more morphological
tags (relative to a given tag-set) and the lemma.
This kind of representation, directly inspired by
one specific type of usage of such resources (i.e.
morphological tagging) takes the inflected form as
an entry point. At the same time, the
morphological point of view is an extensional one,
in the sense that the resource explicitly contains the
list of all inflected forms for one lemma.
Furthermore, the linguistic concepts underlying the
morphological description are not directly
transparent and accessible, since the tags are
generally synthetic tags for a set of values relative
to a set of relevant features. Finally, if any
metadata (such as the contributor or the last up-
date) are associated with such a resource, they are
often encoded in proprietary formats and there is
no possibility to parameterize their scope to
various description levels of the lexicon.
Starting from these observations, we tested LMF
as a formal framework for the design of a
morphological dictionary for French, based on
existing data originally compiled during the
digitization of a wide coverage French dictionary
(TFLi). From a theoretical point of view, the aim
of this experiment is to test the suitability of LMF
at a quite simple level of lexical description. On
the practical side, we wish to generate a resource
that is accessible on-line and that implements the
standardization proposals of ISO/TC 37/SC 4, and
that is application-independent, well documented,
extensible and provides the possibility to add
further lexical description levels, such as syntactic
and semantic information. Therefore, we have tried
to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of
current morphological dictionaries by structuring
the data around lemmas rather than around
inflected forms, by proposing a data model that
combines the co-occurrence of extensional and
intensional morphological information (lists of
inflexions vs. reference to inflexion classes or
paradigms) and by paying special attention to the
issue of the metadata necessary to qualify the
identification of the source data (origin,
contributor, up-date, etc.) and the status of the data
(validated by an editorial committee, testified in a
corpus, etc.).

4.2 The lexical model of Morphalou
The underlying lexical model of the Morphalou
project is a direct application of the LMF prince-
ples with the sole addendum of a simple lexical
extension dedicated to the description of morpho-
logy. This extension can be directly linked to the
lexical entry component of the core metamodel. It
associates a single morphological description
(Morphology component) to each lexical entry.
This morphological description is made up of two
sub-components:
? a Paradigm  component that refers to or
possibly describes the inflexion rules that
govern the flexional behaviour of the entry;
? an Inflexion component that groups together
zero up to n  inflected forms related to the
lexical entry.

Figure 2: Lexical extension for morphology
As stated in section 3, to build up a full model
for a concrete lexical database, one needs to
associate a selection of data categories anchored at
the different components of the metamodel (core
metamodel + morphological lexical extension).
To the Lexical entry component, we basically
associate to this component the data categories
/lemma/ and /grammatical category/. A /key form/
is used in order to uniquely identify the entry
within the lexical database. Possible orthographic
variants may be recorded as /spelling variant/?s.
Finally, depending on editorial choices, one could
also decide to attach /gender/ information here, for
example for nouns, in the case that gender
variation is not considered as inflexional variation,
as opposed to adjectives.
To the Inflexion component: beside /word form/,
which identifies the actual inflected form in the
component, it is necessary to associate the set of
morphological features to provide a unique
specification of the inflexion. The corresponding
data categories are complementary to the general
grammatical category of the entry: /gender/ and
/number/ for adjectives; /tense/, /person/, /number/
and /mood/ for verbs, etc. Appendix 1 provides a
complete list of the data categories we have
considered for the first version of the database;
? Paradigm component: here we essentially need
a /paradigm identifier/ to identify the inflexion
class to which the lexical entry belongs. In
order to integrate further data categories for the
description of the inflexion rules, we still need
to investigate linguistic practices for different
language families.
4.3 Implementing the model: basic examples
 Example 1 implements, in a generic XML
format (GMT, see Romary 2001), a simple lexical
entry and its morphological extension for the
French noun chat (?cat?). The data categories
associated with the lexical entry are /lemma/,
/grammatical category/ and /key form/,
respectively taking the values of chat, noun and
chat_1. The morphology component contains the
identification of the plural inflexion paradigm for
regular French nouns (/fr-s-plural/) and the
complete list of inflected word forms with
associated morphological features, i.e. /number/.
Example 1
<struct type=?lexical entry?>
<feat type=?lemma?>chat</feat>
<feat type=?grammatical category?>common
noun </feat>
<feat type=?key form?>chat_1</feat>
<struct type=?morphology?>
<struct type=?paradigm?>
<feat type=?paradigm identifier?>
fr-s-plural</feat>
</struct>
<struct type=?inflexion?>
<feat type=?word form?>chat</feat>
<feat type=?number?>singular</feat>
</struct>
<struct type=?inflexion?>
<feat type=?word form?>chats</feat>
<feat type=?number?>plural</feat>
</struct>
</struct>
</struct>
In the case that spelling variants exist such as
cheik vs. cheikh (Example 2), these are referred to
in the lexical entry component by means of the
data category /spelling variant/ and an associated
pointer to the /key form/ of the related lexical
entry. Additional mechanisms such as unification
may be envisaged in order to avoid duplication of
the lexical information that is independent from
this variation (syntactic or semantic information,
for example).
Example 2
<struct type=?lexical entry?>
<feat type=?lemma?>cheikh</feat>
<feat type=?spelling variant?
 target=?#cheik_noun?</feat>
<feat type=?grammatical category?>
common noun</feat>
<feat type=?key form?>cheikh_1</feat>
<struct type=?morphology?>
?
</struct>
</struct>
Example 3 to Example 5 ? afghan, ?afghani?,
used as masculine and feminine noun and as an
adjective ?  shows how data categories, here
/gender/, can be used in a flexible way. Depending
on editorial practices, the implementers may, for
example, chose to attach this feature to the lexical
entry for nouns, and to the inflexion component for
adjectives. They will thus consider masculine and
feminine forms of a noun as different lexical
entries (afghan_1 vs. afghane), while grouping
variations for adjectives into one single gender
(afghan_2).

<struct type=?lexical entry?>

4.4 Integrating metadata descriptors
One important issue for the management, up-
dating and distribution of lexical databases is the
appropriate management of metadata, related either
to the identification of data sources or to the
characterization of the data.
Our proposal is based on several international
initiatives related to the definition of descriptors
for language data collections (cf. OLAC
10
,
IMDI
11
). We currently identify those descriptors
that may be relevant for lexical databases, such as
the language identifiers (ISO 16620) or the ?roles?
defined in OLAC (depositor, developer, research-
er, annotator, sponsor, etc.). Concerning data
characterization, existing standards (ISO 16620)
also contain an inventory of possible useful des-
criptors related to the updating process (origination
date, input date, modification date, approval date,
withdrawal date, etc.).
Additional information should be more speci-
fically related to the morphological extension: One
could for example wish to keep track of morpho-
syntactic tags (relative to a given tagset, such as
Multext) currently used to refer to certain in-
flexions (see Example 6). Other useful metadata
would be information about testimony and fre-
quency of inflected forms in corpora, completeness
of an inflexion list (relevant for defective verbs
such as pleuvoir (?to rain?) or indication of special
usages (diachronic, diatopic or diastratic variation).
Example 6
<struct type=?inflexion?>
<brack>
<feat type=?POS tag?>Nms__</feat>
<feat type=?tagset?>Multext</feat>
</brack>
<feat type=?word form?>chat</feat>
<feat type=?number?>singular</feat>
<struct/>
4.5 Morphalou?: current state
The basic model described in this paper (apart
from inflexion paradigms and metadata descrip-
tors, currently under definition) has been used to
build an electronic lexical database of inflected
forms for French
12
. It contains 539413 inflected
forms distributed over 68075 lemmas, converted
from data previously collected at the ATILF
laboratory. The whole database is encoded in
XML. Since we envisage on-line access and the
ability to up-date the data, we devoted particular
attention to the interfaces and to documentation.
The database is searchable through the web, via a
graphical interface or direct XPath queries. The
                                                       
10
 http://www.language-archives.org/
11
 http://www.mpi.nl/IMDI/
12
 http://loreley.loria.fr/morphalou/
graphical interface allows for lemmatization of a
given form and generation of all inflected forms
for a given lemma, whereas the XPath requests
allows for combining search criteria over any
combination of features and strings (for example,
all lexical entries for common nouns having an
inflected form containing the string aba). The next
steps are the development of a JAVA API and web
services to integrate search results directly into
NLP applications and the development of an
editorial line for efficient and coherent update of
the database. Preliminary updating experiments
based on freely accessible morphological databases
such as LEFFF and ABU
13
 are currently running
and reveal the most important problems to be
tackled (conversion of the input format, efficient
comparison of two XML files, linguistic validation
procedures and interfaces for submitted data,
fusion of lexical data).
