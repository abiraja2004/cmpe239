Abstract
A challenge in dialogue act recognition
is the mapping from noisy user inputs to
dialogue acts. In this paper we describe
an approach for re-ranking dialogue act
hypotheses based on Bayesian classifiers
that incorporate dialogue history and Au-
tomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) N-best
information. We report results based on
the Let?s Go dialogue corpora that show
(1) that including ASR N-best information
results in improved dialogue act recogni-
tion performance (+7% accuracy), and (2)
that competitive results can be obtained
from as early as the first system dialogue
act, reducing the need to wait for subse-
quent system dialogue acts.
1 Introduction
The primary challenge of a Dialogue Act Recog-
niser (DAR) is to find the correct mapping be-
tween a noisy user input and its true dialogue
act. In standard ?slot-filling? dialogue sys-
tems a dialogue act is generally represented as
DialogueActType(attribute-value pairs), see Sec-
tion 3. While a substantial body of research has
investigated different types of models and meth-
ods for dialogue act recognition in spoken dia-
logue systems (see Section 2), here we focus on
re-ranking the outputs of an existing DAR for eval-
uation purposes. In practice the re-ranker should
be part of the DAR itself. We propose to use mul-
tiple Bayesian classifiers to re-rank an initial set
of dialogue act hypotheses based on information
from the dialogue history as well as ASR N-best
lists. In particular the latter type of information
helps us to learn mappings between dialogue acts
and common mis-recognitions. We present exper-
imental results based on the Let?s Go dialogue cor-
pora which indicate that re-ranking hypotheses us-
ing ASR N-best information can lead to improved
recognition. In addition, we compare the recogni-
tion accuracy over time and find that high accuracy
can be obtained with as little context as one system
dialogue act, so that there is often no need to take
a larger context into account.
2 Related Work
Approaches to dialogue act recognition from spo-
ken input have explored a wide range of meth-
ods. (Stolcke et al, 2000) use HMMs for dialogue
modelling, where sequences of observations cor-
respond to sequences of dialogue act types. They
also explore the performance with decision trees
and neural networks and report their highest ac-
curacy at 65% on the Switchboard corpus. (Zim-
mermann et al, 2005) also use HMMs in a joint
segmentation and classification model. (Grau et
al., 2004) use a combination of Naive Bayes and
n-grams with different smoothing methods. Their
best models achieve an accuracy of 66% on En-
glish Switchboard data and 89% on a Spanish cor-
pus. (Sridhar et al, 2009; Wright et al, 1999)
both use a maximum entropy classifier with n-
grams to classify dialogue acts using prosodic fea-
tures. (Sridhar et al, 2009) report an accuracy of
up to 74% on Switchboard data and (Wright et al,
1999) report an accuracy of 69% on the DCIEM
Maptask Corpus. (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2006)
maintain an N-best list of slot values using logis-
tic regression. (Surendran and Levow, 2006) use
a combination of linear support vector machines
(SVMs) and HMMs. They report an accuracy of
65.5% on the HCRC MapTask corpus and con-
clude that SVMs are well suited for sparse text and
dense acoustic features. (Gamba?ck et al, 2011)
use SVMs within an active learning framework.
They show that while passive learning achieves an
accuracy of 77.8% on Switchboard data, the ac-
tive learner achieves up to 80.7%. (Henderson et
al., 2012) use SVMs for dialogue act recognition
from ASR word confusion networks.

is a list of dialogue acts with confidence scores, and the output is the same list of dialogue acts but with
recomputed confidence scores. A dialogue act is represented as DialogueActType(attribute-value pairs).
Several authors have presented evidence in
favour of Bayesian methods. (Keizer and op den
Akker, 2007) have shown that Bayesian DARs
can outperform baseline classifiers such as deci-
sion trees. More generally, (Ng and Jordan, 2001)
show that generative classifiers (e.g. Naive Bayes)
reach their asymptotic error faster than discrimina-
tive ones. As a consequence, generative classifiers
are less data intensive than discriminative ones.
In addition, several authors have investigated
dialogue belief tracking. While our approach
is related to belief tracking, we focus here on
spoken language understanding under uncertainty
rather than estimating user goals. (Williams, 2007;
Thomson et al, 2008) use approximate inference
to improve the scalability of Bayes nets for be-
lief tracking and (Lison, 2012) presents work on
improving their scalability through abstraction.
(Mehta et al, 2010) model user intentions through
the use of probabilistic ontology trees.
Bayes nets have also been applied to other
dialogue-related tasks, such as surface realisa-
tion within dialogue (Dethlefs and Cuaya?huitl,
2011) or multi-modal dialogue act recognition
(Cuaya?huitl and Kruijff-Korbayova?, 2011). In the
following, we will explore a dialogue act recogni-
tion technique based on multiple Bayesian classi-
fiers and show that re-ranking with ASR N-best in-
formation can improve recognition performance.
3 Re-Ranking Dialogue Acts Using
Multiple Bayesian Networks
Figure 1 shows an illustration of our dialogue act
re-ranker within a pipeline architecture. Here, pro-
cessing begins with the user?s speech being inter-
preted by a speech recogniser, which produces a
first N-best list of hypotheses. These hypotheses
are subsequently passed on and interpreted by a
dialogue act recogniser, which in our case is rep-
resented by the Let?s Go parser. The parser pro-
duces a first set of dialogue act hypotheses, based
on which our re-ranker becomes active. A full
dialogue act in our scenario consists of three el-
ements: dialogue act types, attributes (or slots),
and slot values. An example dialogue act is in-
form(from=Pittsburgh Downtown). The dialogue
act re-ranker thus receives a list of hypotheses
in the specified form (triples) from its preceding
module (a DAR or in our case the Let?s Go parser)
and its task is to generate confidence scores that
approximate true label (i.e. the dialogue act really
spoken by a user) as closely as possible.
We address this task by using multiple Bayesian
classifiers: one for classifying a dialogue act type,
one for classifying a set of slots, and the rest for
classifying slot values. The use of multiple classi-
fiers is beneficial for scalability purposes; for ex-
ample, assuming 10 dialogue act types, 10 slots,
10 values per slot, and no other dialogue con-
text results in a joint distribution of 1011 parame-
ters. Since a typical dialogue system is required to
model even larger joint distributions, our adopted
approach is to factorize them into multiple inde-
pendent Bayesian networks (with combined out-
puts). A multiple classifier system is a power-
ful solution to complex classification problems in-
volving a large set of inputs and outputs. This
approach not only decreases training time but has
also been shown to increase the performance of
classification (Tax et al, 2000).
A Bayesian Network (BN) models a joint prob-
ability distribution over a set of random variables
and their dependencies, see (Bishop, 2006) for
an introduction to BNs. Our motivation for us-
ing multiple BNs is to incorporate a fairly rich di-
alogue context in terms of what the system and
user said at lexical and semantic levels. In con-
trast, using a single BN for all slots with rich di-
alogue context faces scalability issues, especially
for slots with large numbers of domain values,
and is therefore not an attractive option. We
denote our set of Bayesian classifiers as ? =
{?dat, ?att, ..., ?val(i)}, where BN ?dat is used to
rank dialogue act types, BN ?att is used to rank
attributes, and the other BNs (?val(i)) are used to
315
rank values for each slot i. The score of a user
dialogue act (< d, a, v >) is computed as:
P (d, a, v) = 1Z
?
P (d|pad)P (a|paa)P (v|pav),
where d is a dialogue act type, a is an attribute
(or slot), v is a slot value, pax is a parent random
variable, andZ is a normalising constant. This im-
plies that the score of a dialogue act is the product
of probabilities of dialogue act type and slot-value
pairs. For dialogue acts including multiple slot-
value pairs, the product above can be extended ac-
cordingly. The best and highest ranked hypothesis
(from space H) can be obtained according to:
< d, a, v >?= arg max
<d,a,v>?H
P (d, a, v).
In the following, we describe our experimental
setting. Here, the structure and parameters of our
classifiers will be estimated from a corpus of spo-
ken dialogues, and we will use the equations above
for re-ranking user dialogue acts. Finally, we re-
port results comparing Bayesian classifiers that
make use of ASR N-best information and dialogue
context against Bayesian classifiers that make pre-
dictions based on the dialogue context alone.
4 Experiments and Results
4.1 Data
Our experiments are based on the Let?s Go corpus
(Raux et al, 2005). Let?s Go contains recorded in-
teractions between a spoken dialogue system and
human users who make enquiries about the bus
schedule in Pittsburgh. Dialogues are driven by
system-initiative and query the user sequentially
for five slots: an optional bus route, a departure
place, a destination, a desired travel date, and a
desired travel time. Each slot needs to be explic-
itly (or implicity) confirmed by the user. Our anal-
yses are based on a subset of this data set contain-
ing 779 dialogues with 7275 turns, collected in the
Summer of 2010. From these dialogues, we used
70% for training our classifiers and the rest for
testing (with 100 random splits). Briefly, this data
set contains 12 system dialogue act types1, 11 user
dialogue act types2, and 5 main slots with varia-
tions3. The number of slot values ranges between
1ack, cant help, example, expl conf, go back, hello,
impl conf, more buses, request, restart, schedule, sorry.
2affirm, bye, go back, inform, negate, next bus, prevbus,
repeat, restart, silence, tellchoices.

formation in the remaining random variables.
102 and 103 so that the combination of all possi-
ble dialogue act types, attributes and values leads
to large amounts of triplets. While the majority
of user inputs contain one user dialogue act, the
average number of system dialogue acts per turn
is 4.2. Note that for the user dialogue act types,
we also model silence explicitly. This is often not
considered in dialogue act recognisers: since the
ASR will always try to recognise something out
of any input (even background noise), typical dia-
logue act recognisers will then try to map the ASR
output onto a semantic interpretation.
4.2 Bayesian Networks
We trained our Bayesian networks in a supervised
learning manner and used 43 discrete features (or
random variables) plus a class label (also discrete).
The feature set is described by three main subsets:
25 system-utterance-level binary features4 derived
from the system dialogue act(s) in the last turn; 17
user-utterance-level binary features5 derived from
(a) what the user heard prior to the current turn,
or (b) what keywords the system recognised in its

list of speech recognition hypotheses; and 1 word-
level non-binary feature (* nbest) corresponding
to the slot values in the ASR N-best lists.
Figure 2 shows the Bayes net corresponding to
the classifier used to rank location names. The
random variable from desc is the class label, the
random variable from desc nbest (marked with an
asterisk) incorporates slot values from the ASR
N-best lists, and the remaining variables model
dialogue history context. The structure of our
Bayesian classifiers were derived from the K2 al-
gorithm6, and their parameters were derived from
maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, we
performed probabilistic inference using the Junc-
tion tree algorithm7. Based on these data and
tools, we trained 14 Bayesian classifiers: one for
scoring dialogue act types, one for scoring at-
tributes (slots), and the rest for scoring slot values.
4.3 Experimental Results
We compared 7 different dialogue act recognisers
in terms of classification accuracy. The compar-
ison was made against gold standard data from
a human-labelled corpus. (Semi-Random) is a
recogniser choosing a random dialogue act from
the Let?s Go N-best parsing hypotheses. (Inci) is
our proposed approach considering a context of i
system dialogue acts, and (Ceiling) is a recogniser
choosing the correct dialogue act from the Let?s
Go N-best parsing hypotheses. The latter was used
as a gold standard from manual annotations, which
reflects the proportion of correct labels in the N-
best parsing hypotheses.
We also assessed the impact of ASR N-best in-
formation on probabilistic inference. To this end,
we compared Bayes nets with a focus on the ran-
dom variable ?* nbest?, which in one case con-
tains induced distributions from data and in the
other case contains an equal distribution of slot
values. Our hypothesis is that the former setting
will lead to better performance.
Figure 3 shows the classification accuracy of
our dialogue act recognisers. The first point to no-
tice is that the incorporation of ASR N-best infor-
mation makes an important difference. The per-
formance of recogniser IncK (K being the num-
ber of system dialogue acts) is 66.9% without
ASR N-best information and 73.9% with ASR N-
best information (the difference is significant8 at

p < 0.05). The latter represents a substantial im-
provement over the semi-random baseline (62.9%)
and Lets Go dialogue act recognizer (69%), both
significant at p < 0.05. A second point to notice is
that the differences between Inci (? i>0) recognis-
ers were not significant. We can say that the use of
one system dialogue act as context is as competi-
tive as using a larger set of system dialogue acts.
This suggests that dialogue act recognition carried
out at early stages (e.g. after the first dialogue act)
in an utterance does not degrade recognition per-
formance. The effect is possibly domain-specific
and generalisations remain to be investigated.
Generally, we were able to observe that more
than half of the errors made by the Bayesian clas-
sifiers were due to noise in the environment and
caused by the users themselves, which interfered
with ASR results. Detecting when users do not
convey dialogue acts to the system is therefore still
a standing challenge for dialogue act recognition.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We have described a re-ranking approach for user
dialogue act recognition. Multiple Bayesian clas-
sifiers are used to rank dialogue acts from a set of
dialogue history features and ASR N-best infor-
mation. Applying our approach to the Let?s Go
data we found the following: (1) that including
ASR N-best information results in improved di-
alogue act recognition performance; and (2) that
competitive results can be obtained from as early
as the first system dialogue act, reducing the need
to include subsequent ones.
Future work includes: (a) a comparison of our
317
Bayesian classifiers with other probabilistic mod-
els and forms of training (for example by us-
ing semi-supervised learning), (b) training dia-
logue act recognisers in different (multi-modal and
multi-task) domains, and (c) dealing with random
variables that contain very large domain values.
