The text mining community has shown significant impact for use of text mining in 
drug discovery and basic research.  So far, there have been a lot of point 
solutions that have solved a particular problem or augmented a valuable 
database.  The next step is integrating text mining as part of the entire literature 
analytic solution and delivering it effectively and comprehensively to support 
research in academia, biotechs and pharmaceuticals.
