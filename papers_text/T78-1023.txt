ON THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF VISUAL MENTAL IMAGES 
Stephen Michael Kosslyn 
Harvard University 
There  has  long  been cons iderab le  
cont roversy  over  the  onto log ica l  s ta tus  
of  menta l  images .  Most  recent ly ,  members  
of the  A . I .  communi ty  have  argued for  the  
su f f i c iency  of "propos i t iona l  
representat ion"  and  have  res i s ted  the  
not ion  that  o ther  sor ts  of  
representat ions  are  funct iona l  in the  
human mind .  The  purpose  of th i s  paper  is 
to  rev iew what  I take  to be the  best  
ev idence  that  images  are  d i s t inc t  
funct iona l  representat ions  in human 
memory .  Be fore  rev iewing  these  data ,  
however ,  I o f fe r  a pre l iminary  de f in i t ion  
of  what  I mean by a "v i sua l  menta l  
image. "  Th is  de f in i t ion  ar i ses  out  of 
the  "cathode  ray  tube"  metaphor  
o r ig ina l ly  in t roduced in Koss lyn  (1974,  
1975,  1976)  and  la ter  imp lemented  in a 
computer  s imu la t ion  by Koss lyn  & Shwar tz  
(1977a,  in p ress ) .  On th i s  v iew,  images  
are  spat ia l  representat ions  in ac t ive  
memory  generated  f rom more  abst rac t  
representat ions  in Long- term memory ;  
these  spat ia l  representat ions  are  ab le  to  
be  in terpreted  ( " inspected" )  by 
procedures  that  c lass i fy  them in to  
var ious  semant ic  categor ies .  
1.0 A pre l iminar  7 de f in i t ion  of a v i sua l  
menta l  image 
I w ish  to de f ine  a "v i sua l  menta l  
image"  in te rms of f i ve  bas ic  k inds  of 
p roper t ies .  Images  are o f ten  
d i s t ingu ished  f rom more  d i sc re te ,  
p ropos i t iona l  or  l ingu is t i c  
representat ions  because  they  supposed ly  
have  "ana logue"  proper t ies .  Thus ,  the  
f i r s t  two  proper t ies  noted  be low descr ibe  
ana logue  representat ions  as a c lass .  
Goodman (1968) ,  Pa lmer  ( in p ress ) ,  
Shepard  (1975) ,  S loman (1975) ,  and  o thers  
have  prov ided  in fo rmat ive  and  deta i led  
d i scuss ions  of re levance  here ,  and  I w i l l  
d raw f ree ly  on these  sources  in the  
present  d i scuss ion .  
1) Images  can  capture  cont inuous  
var ia t ions  in shape .  Th is  cont inu i ty  
The  work  repor ted  here  was  suppor ted  
by NSF  Grants  BNS 76-16987 and  BNS 77-21782.  
I w ish  to thank  Wi l la  Rouder  for  her  ass i s tanCean "abst rac t  f i r s t -o rder  i somorph ism."  
in p repar ing  the  manuscr ip t .  
p roper ty  imp l ies  that  image 
representat ions  are  both  semant ica l ly  and 
syntact i ca l ly  "dense"  or  
"und i f fe rent ia ted"  in the  ext reme 
(Goodman,  1968,  p. 136 f f . ) .  For  
example ,  a read ing  on a t i re  pressure  
gauge is an ana logue  representat ion  to 
some extent ,  because  every  read ing  a long  
the  cont inuous  sca le  has  mean ing  (and so 
i t  is semant ica l ly  dense) ;  if the  gauge 
had  an in f in i ty  of mark ings  of  
pounds-per -square  inch ,  the  sca le  wou ld  
be syntact i ca l ly  dense  and  read ings  on it  
wou ld  be pure ly  ana logue .  In cont ras t ,  
d i sc re te  representat ions  are  not  
semant ica l ly  or  syntact i ca l ly  dense ,  but  
a re  d i f fe rent ia ted  ( i .e . ,  separab le  and  
d is t inc t ) .  For  example ,  each  read ing  of  
a d ig i ta l  c lock ,  in cont ras t  to the  
t rad i t iona l  d ia l  var ie ty ,  is ent i re ly  
unambiguous  in te rms of i ts  ident i ty  
( i .e? ,  is syntact i ca l l y  d is t inc t )  and  i ts  
mean ing  ( i .e . ,  is semant ica l ly  d i s t inc t ) .  
Images  are both  semant ica l ly  and  
syntac ica l ly  dense .  
2) Par t  and  parce l  of  the  cont inu i ty  
proper ty  is the  proper ty  that  ana logue  
representat ions  are  not  a rb i t ra r i l y  
re la ted  to the i r  re ferents .  Because  
ana logue  representat ions  can  be ar ranged 
on  a cont inuum (e .g . ,  of s i ze ) ,  a symbo l  
ind icat ing  a va lue  fa l l ing  between two 
others  (e .g . ,  an in termed ia te  s i ze )  must  
re fer  to a va lue  of the  re ferent  fa l l ing  
between the  two ind icated  by the  o thers  
(e .g . ,  an ob jec t  of  in termed ia te  s i ze ) .  
Hence ,  un l i ke  d i sc re te  representat ions ,  
any  g iven  ana logue  representat ion  cannot  
be ass igned an arb i t ra ry  mean ing  ( th is  
po in t  was  f i r s t  b rought  to  my at tent ion  
by  Wi lk ins ,  1977) .  
Because  of th i s  requ i rement ,  
por t ions  of images  of  sur faces  or  ob jec ts  
( invo lv ing  two or  th ree  d imens ions)  bear  
a one- to -one  s t ructura l  i somorph ism to 
the  cor respond ing  por t ions  of  the  
re ferent .  That  is, por t ions  of  the 
representat ion  cor respond to por t ions  of 
the  re ferent ,  and  the  spat ia l  re la t ions  
between por t ions  of the  re ferent  are  
preserved  in the  image.  Th is  p roper ty  
has  been descr ibed  by Shepard  (1975)  as 
In 
167 
th i s  case ,  there  is not  a genu ine  
f i r s t -o rder  i somorph ism,  where  a t r iang le  
is  ac tua l ly  represented  by someth ing  
t r iangu lar  in the  bra in ,  but  there  is a 
more  abst rac t  i somorph ism where  a 
t r iang le  is represented  by a set  of 
representat ions  cor respond ing  to the  
ver t i ces  and  s ides  s tand ing  in the  proper  
re la t ions .  Thus ,  images  dep ic t ,  not  
descr ibe  '. wh i le  any  symbo l  can  be used  
to  represent  an ob jec t  or  par t  thereof  in 
a descr ip t ion ,  the  par t i cu la r  
representat ion  of  such  in an image is 
const ra ined  by o ther  
representat ions - -g iven  that  the  
in terpor t ion  spat ia l  re la t ions  must  be 
re ta ined  in the  image representat ion .  
The  fo l low ing  three  add i t iona l  
p roper t ies  fo l low f rom our  CRT metaphor :  
3} Images  occur  in a spat ia l  med ium 
that  is equ iva lent  to  a Euc l idean  
coord inate  space .  Th is  does  not  mean 
that  there  is l i te ra l ly  a sc reen  in the  
head.  i Rather ,  locat ions  are  accessed  
such  that  the  spat ia l  p roper t ies  of  
phys ica l  space  are  preserved .  A per fec t  
example  of th i s  is a s imp le  
two-d imens iona l  a r ray  s tored  in a 
computer ' s  memory :  There  is no phys ica l  
mat r ix  in the  memory  banks ,  but  because  
of  the  way  in wh ich  ce l l s  are  re t r ieved ,  
one  can  sens ib ly  speak  of the  in ter -ce l l  
re la t ions  in te rms of ad jacency ,  
d i s tance ,  and  o ther  geometr i c  p roper t ies .  
4) The  same sor ts  of representat ions  
that  under l ie  sur face  images  a l so  
under l ie  the  cor respond ing  percepts .  
Hence ,  in add i t ion  to  reg is ter ing  spat ia l  
p roper t ies  l i ke  those  of p ic tures ,  images  
dep ic t  sur face  proper t ies  of ob jec ts ,  
l l ke  texture  and co lo r .  Thus ,  a l though 
the  image i t se l f  is not  mot t led ,  or  
g reen ,  or  la rge  or smal l ,  i t  can  
represent  such  proper t ies  in the  same way 
they  are  represented  in our  percepts .  
That  is, the  image representat ions  must  
be ab le  to a t ta in  s ta tes  that  p roduce  the  
Qua l ia ,  the  exper ience  of see ing  texture ,  
co lo r ,  s i ze  and  so on.  
5) F ina l ly ,  by d in t  of  the  
s t ruc tura l  ident i ty  of image 
representat ions  and  those  under ly ing  the  
cor respond ing  percept ,  images  may be 
appropr ia te ly  processed  by mechan isms 
usua l ly  recru i ted  on ly  dur ing  
l i ke -moda l i ty  percept ion ,  For  example ,  
one  may eva luate  an image in te rms of i ts  
"s i ze"  ( i .eo ,  be ing  dep ic ted- - the  
representat ion  i t se l f  is n~i ther  la rge  
nor  smal l}  in the  same way one  wou ld  
eva luate  the  representat ion  evoked wh i le  
ac tua l ly  see ing  the  ob jec t ,  
Images ,  then ,  share  v i r tua l ly  a l l  
the  proper t ies  of  percepts ,  as opposed  to  
proper t ies  of  p ic tures  or  ob jec ts  
themse lves .  I re f ra in  f rom mak ing  a 
i. A l though there  cou ld  be, if images  
occur  as topograph ic  pro jec t ions  on the  
sur face  of the cor tex l  th i s  k ind  of  space  
is a subset  of the  one I am def in ing  
here ,  however .  
complete  ident i ty  because  of a c ruc ia l  
d i f fe rence :  Perceptua l  representat ions  
are  "dr iven"  f rom the  per iphery ,  whereas  
images  are somehow formed f rom memory .  
Hence ,  in both  cases  there  may be 
par t i cu la r  k inds  of  "capac i ty  
l im i ta t ions"  that  in f luence  proper t ies  of  
the  representat ion .  For  example  (and  
th i s  is an empi r i ca l  quest ion} ,  images  
may be coarser  and  less  deta i led  than  the  
cor respond ing  percept  because  of  memory  
capac i ty  l im i ts .  
These  proper t ies  of  images  can  be 
fu r ther  unders tood  in cont ras t  to  
proper t ies  of  "propos i t iona l "  
representat ions .  Cons ider  the  two 
representat ions  of  a ba l l  on a box  
i l lus t ra ted  in F igure  I. A propos i t iona l  
representat ion  must  have:  1) a funct ion  
or  re la t ion ;  2} at  leas t  one  argument ;  3} 
ru les  of fo rmat ion ;  and  4) a t ru th  va lue .

Figure i. Two representations of a ball on a box. 
In cont ras t :  
1) Images  do  not  conta in  
ident i f i ab ly  d i s t inc t  re la t ions ;  
re la t ions  on ly  emerge  f rom the  
cong lomerate  o f  the  components  be ing  
represented  together .  Thus ,  one  needs  
two components  be fore  a re la t ion  l i ke  
"on"  can  be represented .  
2} Images  do not  conta in  a rguments .  
The  components  of  an image are  not  
d i sc re te  ent i t ies  that  can  be re la ted  
together  in p rec ise  ways .  The  box ,  fo r  
example ,  can  be decomposed in to  faces ,  
edges ,  and  so on- -and  these  are  cer ta in ly  
not  a rguments  in and  of themse lves .  
3) Images  do not  seem to  have  a 
syntax  (except  perhaps  in the  roughest  
sense} .  That  is,  a re la t ion  l l ke  "on"  
requ i res  two  arguments  in o rder  to  c reate  
a we l l - fo rmed propos i t ion ;  "on  box"  is an 
unacceptab le  f ragment .  In cont ras t ,  any  
syntax  d ic ta t ing  "we l l - fo rmedness"  of  
p ic tures  or  images  w i l l  p robab ly  depend 
on  som e sor t  o f  in teract ion  w i th  a 
"semant ic  component , "  w i l l  depend on what  
an  image is supposed  to  be an image of.  
As  we a l l  know,  " imposs ib le  p ic tures"  a re  
c reated  regu lar ly  (e .g . ,  by  ar t i s ts  such  
as  Escher ) ,  and  ru les  that  govern  the  
nature  of ob jec ts  in the  wor ld  may not  
168 
necessar i l y  const ra in  the  th ings  that  one  
can  dep ic t  in a p ic ture .  
4) Fiy a l ly ,  un l i ke  a propos i t ion ,  an 
image does  not  have  a t ru th  va lue .  In 
fac t ,  as Wi t tgenste in  (1953} po in ted  out ,  
there  is noth ing  in t r ins ic  in a p ic ture  
o f  a man wa lk ing  up a h i l l  that  p revents  
one  f rom in terpret ing  it  as a p ic ture  of  
a man s l id ing  downh i l l  backwards .  The  
mean ing  of  an image,  and  hence  i ts  t ru th  
va lue ,  a re  ass igned by processes  that  
work  over  the  representat ion  and  are  not  
inherent  in the  representat ion  i t se l f .

A key  proper ty  of images  is that  
they  embody spat ia l  ex tent .  If images  
are  funct iona l ,  then ,  we shou ld  expect  
th i s  p roper ty  to a f fec t  some fo rms of 
p rocess ing  that  invo lve  us ing  images .  
Koss lyn ,  Ba l l ,  & Re iser  (1978} repor t  a 
number  of  exper iments  that  demonst ra te  
that  more  t ime is requ i red  to scan  
fu r ther  d i s tances  across  menta l  images .  
In one  s tudy ,  peop le  imaged a map 
conta in ing  seven  locat ions  and  scanned 
between a l l  poss ib le  pa i rs  o f  locat ions .  
T ime to  scan  increased  l inear ly  w i th  
increas ing  d i s tance  between the  21 
poss ib le  pa i rs  o f  locat ions ,  each  of  
wh ich  was  separated  by a un ique  d is tance .  
There  were  no  e f fec ts  of  d i s tance  in a 
cont ro l  cond i t ion  where  sub jec ts  focused  
on  a locat ion  in the  image but  then  
s imply  dec ided  whether  another  ob jec t  was  
present ,  w i thout  be ing  asked  to  scan  to  
that  locat ion .  
In another  exper iment ,  peop le  imaged 
schemat ic  faces  where in  the  eyes  were  
e i ther  l lght  or  dark  and  located  e i ther  
3, 4, or  5 inches  above  the  mouth ;  in a l l  
o ther  respects  the  faces  were  ident ica l .  
A f te r  a g iven  face  had  been removed,  a 
sub jec t  was  asked  to  focus  on the  mouth  
and  then  to:  image the  face  as la rge  as 
poss ib le  w i thout  it seeming  to over f low,  
o r  image it ha l f  of  th i s  s i ze ,  or  image 
i t  so  la rge  sub jec t ive ly  that  on ly  the  
mouth  was  le f t  v i s ib le  in the  image.  
Fo l low ing  th i s ,  the  word  " l ight"  or  
"dark"  was  presented .  As soon  as e i ther  
word  had  occur red ,  the  sub jec t  was  to  
"g lance  up"  to  the  eyes  of  the  imaged 
face  and  see  whether  or  not  they  were  
appropr ia te ly  descr ibed  by the  word .  
T ime to  judge  whether  the  eyes  were  l ight  
o r  dark  increased  l lnear ly  w i th  d i s tance  
f rom the  mouth .  Fur ther ,  overa l l  
scann ing  t imes  were  reduced when peop le  
were  asked  to "shr ink"  an imaged face  
menta l ly  p r io r  to  scann ing  it ,  and  t imes  
were  increased  when sub jec ts  "expanded"  a 
face before  scann ing .  These  resu l t s  a re  
d i f f i cu l t  to  exp la in  i f  images  are  s imple  
"abst rac t  p ropos i t iona l "  l i s t  s t ruc tures ,  
but  fo l low natura l ly  if images  are  
spat ia l  representat ions  that  p reserve  
metr i c  d i s tance  in fo rmat ion .  
2 .2  Measur in~ the  v i sua l  ang le  of  the  
mind 's  eye  
The  not ion  that  images  embody 
spat ia l  ex tent  suggests  that  they  may 
have  spat ia l  boundar ies ;  a f te r  a l l ,  they  
do not  extend  on indef in i te ly .  If images  
occur  in a spat ia l  representat iona l  
med ium,  then  the i r  max imal  spat ia l  ex tent  
may be const ra ined  by the  extent  of  the  
med ium i t se l f .  Koss lyn  ( in p ress}  used  
the  fo l low ing  parad igm in an a t tempt  to 
tes t  th i s  idea :  Peop le  were  asked  to 
image an  ob jec t  as if i t  were  be ing  seen  
f rom very  fa r  away .  Then ,  they  were  
asked  to imag ine  wa lk ing  towards  the  
ob jec t  and  were  asked  if  it appeared  to 
loom la rger ;  a l l  sub jec ts  repor ted  that  
i t  d id  (of the  sub jec ts  who cou ld  do the  
task  at  a l l ,  wh ich  was  usua l ly  on ly  about  
80% of the  peop le  tes ted} .  Fur ther ,  
these  sub jec ts  c la imed that  the  image 
loomed so la rge  at  one  po in t  that  it 
seemed to "over f low."  At  th i s  po in t ,  the  
sub jec t  was  to  "s top"  in h i s /her  menta l  
wa lk  and  to es t imate  how far  away the  
ob jec t  wou ld  be i f  s /he  were  ac tua l ly  
see ing  i t  at  that  sub jec t ive  s i ze .  We 
d id  th i s  bas ic  exper iment  in a var ie ty  of 
ways ,  hav ing  sub jec ts  image var ious  sor ts  
o f  p ic tures  or  image an imals  when g iven  
jus t  the i r  names  and  s i zes ;  in add i t ion ,  
sub jec ts  es t imated  d is tance  by verba l ly  
assess ing  feet  and  inches  or  responded by 
mov ing  a t r ipod  apparatus  the  appropr ia te  
d i s tance  f rom a b lank  wa l l .  
If images  occur  in a ~spat ia l l y  
const ra ined  med ium,  then  the  la rger  the  
imaged ob jec t ,  the  fu r ther  away it  shou ld  
seem at the  po in t  of  over f low.  In 
add i t ion ,  a constant  ang le  shou ld  be 
subtended by the  imaged ob jec ts  (wh ich  
ranged in ac tua l  s i ze )  at  the  po in t  of  
over f low.  Us ing  s imple  t r igonometry ,  we 
were  ab le  to compute  the  "v i sua l  ang le  of 
the  mind 's  eye"  f rom the  es t imated  
d is tances  and  longest  ax is  of each  imaged 
ob jec t .  In a l l  of  our  exper iments ,  the  
bas ic  resu l t s  were  the  same:  F i r s t ,  
peop le  c la imed that  smal le r  ob jec ts  
seemed to over f low at  nearer  apparent  
d i s tances  than  d id  la rger  ob jec ts  ( the 
cor re la t ion  between ob jec t  s i ze  and  
d is tance  was  a lways  very  h igh} ,  and  
d is tance  usua l ly  inc reased  l inear ly  w i th  
s i ze  of the  imaged ob jec t .  Second,  the  
ca lcu ia ted  "v i sua l  ang le"  at the  po in t  of  
over f low remained  constant  fo r  
d l f fe rent -s i zed  ob jec ts  when sub jec ts  
imaged p ic tures  or  ob jec ts  that  had  jus t  
been  presented .  The  actua l  s i ze  of the  
ang le  var ied ,  however ,  depend ing  on 
ins t ruct ions :  More  s t r ingent  de f in i t ions  
o f  "over f low"  resu l ted  in smal le r  ang les .  
These  las t  f ind ings  imp ly  that  images  do 
not  over f low at  a d i s t inc t  po in t ,  but  
seem to  fade  of  g radua l ly  towards  the  
per iphery .  (The best  es t imate  of the 
max imal  ang le  subtended by an image wh i le  
s t i l l  remain ing  ent i re ly  v i s ib le  seemed 
to  be around 20 degrees .}  
In another  exper iment ,  we asked  
169 
peop le  to scan  images  of  l ines  subtend ing  
d i f fe rent  amounts  of  v i sua l  a rc  and  we 
ca lcu la ted  how many msec  were  requ i red  to 
scan  each  degree .  These  peop le  a l so  
scanned an  image of a l lne  they  had  
const ructed  to be as long  as poss ib le  
w i thout  e i ther  end  over f low ing .  The  
v i sua l  a rc  subtended by th i s  " longest  
poss ib le  non-over f low ing  l lne"  was  
in fe r red  f rom the  t ime requ i red  to scan  
across  it. Th is  es t imate  was  very  c lose  
to  one  obta ined  us ing  the  techn ique  
descr ibed  above  and  to one  obta ined  by 
s imply  ask ing  peop le  to  ind icate  the  
sub jec t ive  s i ze  of a longest  
non-over f low lng  l ine  by ho ld ing  the i r  
hands  apar t  so as to span  the  length  of  
the  longest  l ine .  
2.3 E f fec ts  of  sub jec t ive  s i ze  on ease  
o'~--"seeing" par ts  of  menta l  images  
If asked  wh ich  is h igher  o f f  the  
ground,  a horse 's  knees  or  the  t ip  of i ts  
ta i l ,  many  peop le  c la im to  image the  
beast  and  to " inspect"  the  image,  
eva luat ing  the  quer ied  re la t ion .  It 
makes  sense  to  suspect ,  then ,  that  images  
might  be appropr ia te ly  processed  by the  
same sor ts  o f  c lass i f i ca tory  procedures  
used  in categor i z ing  perceptua l  
representat ions .  If so, then  we might  
expect  const ra in ts  that  a f fec t  ease  of 
c lass i fy ing  par ts  perceptua l ly  a l so  to 
a f fec t  ease  of imagery  c lass i f i ca t ion .  
Par ts  of smal le r  ob jec ts  are  "harder  to 
see"  in percept ion ,  fo r  example ,  and  a l so  
may be harder  to  "see"  in imagery .  Th is  
resu l t  was  in fac t  obta ined  (see Koss lyn ,  
1975) ;  par ts  o f  sub jec t ive ly  smal le r  
images  of  ob jec ts  d id  requ i re  more  t ime 
to  c lass i fy  menta l ly  than  d id  par ts  of  
sub jec t ive ly  la rger  imaged ob jec ts .  In 
add i t ion ,  s imp ly  vary ing  the  s i ze  of the  
par t  ~ s_s a l so  a f fec ted  t ime to examine  
an  image.  In th i s  case ,  smal le r  
par ts - - l i ke  a cat ' s  c laws- - requ i red  more  
t ime to  see on an image than  d id  la rger  
par ts - - l i ke  i t s  head .  Th is  las t  resu l t  
was  obta ined  (Koss lyn ,  1976)  even  though 
the  smal le r  par ts  were  more  s t rong ly  
assoc ia ted  w i th  the  an imal  in quest ion ,  
and  were  more  qu ick ly  ver i f ied  as 
be long ing  to the  an imal  when imagery  was  
not  used  (more  h igh ly  assoc ia ted  
proper t ies  are  typ ica l ly  a f f i rmed as 
appropr ia te  more  qu ick ly  than  less  
assoc ia ted  ones  in s tud ies  of "semant ic  
memory" - - see  Smi th ,  Shoben & R ips ,  19~4) .  
These  f ind ings ,  then ,  not  on ly  a re  
cons is tent  w i th  the  not ion  that  images  
are  funct iona l  spat ia l  representat ions  
that  may be in terpreted  by o ther  
processes ,  but  a l so  serve  to  d i s t ingu ish  
between process ing  imag ina l  and  
non- imag ina l  representat ions .  
2 .4  E f fec ts  o~f sub jec t ive  s i ze  on la ter  
memory  
If par ts  of  sub jec t ive ly  smal le r  
images  are  less  d i s t inc t ,  then  one might  
expect  that  the  imaged ob jec t  i t se l f  
wou ld  be more  d i f f i cu l t  to  ident i fy .  
Thus ,  if one  actua l ly  encodes  a 
sub jec t ive ly  smal l  image in to  memory ,  
one 's  ab i l i ty  to reca l l  the  ob jec t  la ter  
shou ld  be poorer  than  if the  image had  
been la rger - - i f  in fac t  the  image i t se l f  
is  reca l led  and  inspected  when one t r ies  
to  reca l l  the  encoded words  or  ob jec ts .  
Koss lyn  & A lper  (1977)  asked  sub jec ts  to 
const ruct  images  of the ob jec ts  named by 
pa i rs  of  words .  Somet imes  one  of the  
images  was  to be very  smal l  sub jec t ive ly  
and  somet imes  both  images  were  to be 
"normal"  s i zes .  When a surpr i se  memory  
tes t  for  the  words  was  la ter  
admin is tered ,  memory  was  in fac t  worse  i f  
one  member  of  a pa i r  in i t ia l l y  had  been 
imaged at a sub jec t ive ly  smal l  s i ze .  
Th is  resu l t  was  rep l i ca ted  in severa l  
s tud ies ,  each  of wh ich  cont ro l led  for  
d i f fe rent  poss ib le  confound ings  (e .g . ,  
l ess  "depth  of p rocess ing"  may have  
occur red  when peop le  const ructed  
sub jec t ive ly  smal le r  images) .  
2 .5  T rans forming  v i sua l  images  
Cooper  & Shepard  (1973a,  1973b)  and  
o thers  have  demonst ra ted  that  
inc reas ing ly  more  t ime is requ i red  when 
one  " ro ta tes"  a menta l  image through 
progress ive ly  greater  a rcs .  S imi la r ly ,  
we  have  found that  more  t ime is requ i red  
to  expand or cont ract  images  to greater  
degrees  (Koss lyn  & Shwar tz ,  1977b) ,  as 
d id  Seku lar  & Nash  (1971) .  A 
propos i t iona l  mode l  of the  sor t  o f fe red  
by  G ips  (1974)  does  not  lead  us to expect  
these  resu l t s .  A spat ia l  mode l ,  where in  
a p ic tor ia l  image is t rans formed,  seems 
to  imp ly  in a s t ra ight fo rward  manner  that  
images  w i l l  pass  th rough in termed ia te  
pos i t ions  as they  are  t rans formed,  g iven  
that  the  same image is be ing  re ta ined  and  
processed .  
3.0 Conc lus ions  
On my v iew,  the  most  pars imon ious ,  
s t ra ight fo rward  accounts  of a l l  these  
data  w i l l  inc lude  the  not ion  that  images  
are  funct iona l  representat ions  in human 
memory .  I have  no doubt  that  a l te rnat ive  
non- imagery  accounts  can  be fo rmulated  
for  each  set  of  resu l t s ,  but  the  
co l lec t ion  of  each  of  these  ind iv idua l  
accounts  w i l l  l i ke ly  be more  ad hoc ,  post  
hoc  and  cumbersome than  the  imagery  
accounts .
