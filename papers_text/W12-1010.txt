Abstract
Even though NLP tools are widely used for
contemporary text today, there is a lack of
tools that can handle historical documents.
Such tools could greatly facilitate the work
of researchers dealing with large volumes
of historical texts. In this paper we pro-
pose a method for extracting verbs and their
complements from historical Swedish text,
using NLP tools and dictionaries developed
for contemporary Swedish and a set of nor-
malisation rules that are applied before tag-
ging and parsing the text. When evaluated
on a sample of texts from the period 1550?
1880, this method identifies verbs with an
F-score of 77.2% and finds a partially or
completely correct set of complements for
55.6% of the verbs. Although these re-
sults are in general lower than for contem-
porary Swedish, they are strong enough to
make the approach useful for information
extraction in historical research. Moreover,
the exact match rate for complete verb con-
structions is in fact higher for historical
texts than for contemporary texts (38.7%
vs. 30.8%).
1 Introduction
Today there is an abundance of NLP tools that
can analyse contemporary language and extract
information relevant to a particular user need, but
there is a real lack of tools that can handle histor-
ical documents. Historians and other researchers
working with older texts are still mostly forced to
manually search large amounts of text in order to
find the passages of interest to their research. De-
veloping tools to facilitate this process is a great
challenge, however, as historical texts vary greatly
in both spelling and grammar between different
authors, genres and time periods, and even within
the same text, due to the lack of spelling conven-
tions. In addition to this, there is a shortage of
annotated resources that can be used for the de-
velopment and evaluation of new tools.
The work presented in this paper has been car-
ried out in cooperation with historians, who are
studying what men and women did for a living
in the Early Modern Swedish society. Currently,
the historians are manually extracting segments
describing work activities from a number of his-
torical texts, and entering them into a database,
the Gender and Work Database. Their work so far
has shown that the typical segment describing an
activity of work is a verb construction, that is, a
verb together with its complements (A?gren et al,
2011). (Examples of such segments can be found
below in Table 1.) It is very likely that the manual
effort and the time needed by the historians to find
these segments and enter them into the database
could be substantially reduced if verbs and their
complements were automatically extracted and
presented to the historian. This would give a gen-
eral overview of the content of a text, and the
task of the historian would be to select those seg-
ments that are actually describing work activities.
By linking extracted segments back to larger pas-
sages of text, historians would also be able to find
additional segments that were missed by the first
automatic extraction. The core of such a system
would be a component for identifying verb con-
structions in running text.
We propose a method for automatically iden-
tifying verbs and their complements in various
types of historical documents, produced in the
Early Modern Swedish period (1550?1800). The
method is based on using existing NLP tools for
65
contemporary Swedish, in particular a part-of-
speech tagger and a syntactic parser, and auto-
matically normalising the input text into a more
modern orthography before running it through
the tagger and parser. In order to increase the
precision of complement extraction, we use va-
lency dictionaries to filter out unlikely comple-
ments in the output of the syntactic parser. Using
this method, we are able to identify verbs with
an F-score of 77.2% and find a partially or com-
pletely correct set of complements for 55.6% of
the verbs. To our knowledge, extracting verb con-
structions from historical texts is a task that has
not been directly addressed in previous research,
which means that these results are also important
in setting benchmarks for future research.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
reviews related work. Section 3 describes the
method for identification of verbs and comple-
ments in more detail. Section 4 presents the data
and evaluation metrics used in our experiments,
and Section 5 discusses the results of the evalua-
tion. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
Using NLP tools for analysing historical texts is
still to a large extent unexplored. There is how-
ever a growing interest in this area, and there have
been attempts to analyse historical texts (1) by us-
ing contemporary NLP tools as they are, (2) by
using such tools in combination with normalisa-
tion rules and/or dictionaries covering historical
language variation, and (3) by training new tools
on annotated historical corpora.
Pennacchiotti and Zanzotto (2008) concluded
that contemporary NLP tools are not suitable as
they are for analysing historical text. They tried
to use a contemporary dictionary, morphological
analyser and part-of-speech tagger to analyse Ital-
ian texts from the period 1200?1881. In their ex-
periments, the dictionary only covered approxi-
mately 27% of the words in the oldest text, as
compared to 62.5% of the words in a contem-
porary Italian newspaper text. Consequently, the
morphological analyser based on the dictionary
reached an accuracy of only 48%, as compared
to 91% for contemporary text. Similarly, the part-
of-speech tagger used reached an accuracy of only
54%, as compared to 97% for contemporary text.
Oravecz et al (2010) included a standardis-
ation/normalisation step in their work on semi-
automatically annotating a corpus of Old Hun-
garian. Normalisation was performed using a
noisy channel model combined with morphologi-
cal analysis filtering and decision tree reranking.
Combining these methods, they reached a normal-
isation precision of 73.3%.
Rocio et al (1999) used a grammar of contem-
porary Portuguese to syntactically annotate me-
dieval Portuguese texts. A dictionary and inflec-
tional rules for medieval Portuguese were added
to the parser, to make it suitable for handling these
texts. This approach proved to be successful for
partial parsing of medieval Portuguese texts, even
though there were some problems remaining con-
cerning grammar limitations, dictionary incom-
pleteness and insufficient part-of-speech tagging.
Sa?nchez-Marco et al (2011) adapted an ex-
isting NLP tool to deal with Old Spanish. The
adapted tool had an accuracy of 94.5% in find-
ing the right part of speech, and 89.9% accuracy
in finding the complete morphological tag. The
adaptation was performed on the basis of a 20 mil-
lion token corpus of texts from the 12th to the 16th
century, and included expansion of the dictionary,
modification of tokenisation and affixation rules,
and retraining of the tagger. The retraining was
based on a gold standard of 30,000 tokens, where
the tokens were first pre-annotated with the con-
temporary tagger, and then manually corrected.
Adding new words to the dictionary had the high-
est impact on the results. This was done by au-
tomatically generating word forms through map-
ping old spelling variants to their contemporary
counterparts.
Pettersson and Nivre (2011) presented a study
on automatically extracting verbs from Swedish
17th century texts, using contemporary language
technology tools combined with normalisation
of the input text. The verb extraction process
included an iterative process of normalisation
and morphological analysis, followed by part-of-
speech tagging for disambiguation of competing
interpretations and for analysing words still un-
known to the morphological analyser after all nor-
malisation rules had been applied. Using this
method, verbs were extracted with 82% precision
and 88% recall. The study also included the re-
sults of using only the part-of-speech tagger for
verb recognition, i.e., dropping the morphologi-
cal analyser. This resulted in a small decrease in
precision to 81% and in recall to 86%.

3 Extraction of Verb Constructions
In this paper, we will focus on adapting existing
NLP tools by adding normalisation rules prior to
processing. We will mainly follow the method-
ology for verb extraction described in Petters-
son and Nivre (2011), but adding the extraction
of not only the verbs themselves, but also their
adherent complements. It would perhaps have
been desirable to use tools specifically trained for
analysing historical texts. This would however be
a resource-demanding task, considering the lack
of annotated data and the language variation, and
is currently not a realistic scenario.
The goal is to automatically extract verbs and
relevant complements from historical texts, in or-
der to give an overview of the contents and present
segments that are possibly describing work activ-
ities. In this context, we use the term complement
in a broad sense and do not impose a sharp dis-
tinction between complements and adjuncts, es-
pecially not for prepositional phrases. This is mo-
tivated by the fact that in the Gender and Work
Database, both segments that would traditionally
be seen as complements and phrases that would
rather be categorised as adjuncts have been con-
sidered relevant.
A closer look at the database shows that 67%
of the entered segments consist of a verb with a
direct object. Other common constructions are
verbs with a prepositional complement (11%),
verbs with both a direct object and a preposi-
tional complement (10%), and (intransitive) verbs
without complements (7%). Table 1 illustrates
the most common construction types found in
the database, which have been used to define the
rules for extracting complements from parsed sen-
tences. There were also a small number of seg-
ments (8 in total), that we were not able to cate-
gorise.
3.1 System Overview
The extraction of verbs and their complements is
basically performed in five steps:
1. Tokenisation
2. Normalisation
3. Part-of-speech tagging
4. Parsing
5. Extraction of verb constructions

Table 1: Segments describing work activities in the

plements in brackets. Grammatical functions: dobj =
direct object, pcomp = prepositional complement, in-
trans = intransitive, indobj = indirect object, infc = in-
finitive clause, subc = subordinate clause.
Tokenisation is performed with a simple tokeniser
for Swedish that has not been adapted for histori-
cal texts.
3.2 Normalisation
After tokenisation, each word is normalised to a
more modern spelling using a set of 29 hand-
crafted rules. The rules were developed us-
ing a text sample from Per Larssons dombok,
a selection of court records from 1638 (Edling,
1937), a sample that has not been used in sub-
sequent evaluation. An example of a normalisa-
tion rule is the transformation of the letter com-
bination sch into sk, as in the old spelling schall
that is normalised to the contemporary spelling
skall (?shall/should?). Some additional rules were
also formulated based on the reformed Swedish
spelling introduced in 1906 (Bergman, 1995).
This set of rules includes the transformation of
double vowels into a single vowel, as in so?o?ka,
which is normalised into so?ka (?search?).
67
3.3 Part-of-speech Tagging
The purpose of part-of-speech tagging in our ex-
periments is both to find the verbs in the text and
to prepare for the parsing step, in which the com-
plements are identified. Part-of-speech tagging is
performed using HunPOS (Hala?csy et al, 2007),
a free and open source reimplementation of the
HMM-based TnT-tagger by Brants (2000). The
tagger is used with a pre-trained language model
based on the Stockholm-Umea? Corpus (SUC), a
balanced, manually annotated corpus of different
text types representative of the Swedish language
in the 1990s, comprising approximately one mil-
lion tokens (Gustafson-Capkova? and Hartmann,
2006). Megyesi (2009) showed that the HunPOS
tagger trained on SUC, is one of the best perform-
ing taggers for (contemporary) Swedish texts.
3.4 Parsing
The normalised and tagged input text is parsed us-
ing MaltParser version 1.6, a data-driven depen-
dency parser developed by Nivre et al (2006a).
In our experiments, the parser is run with a pre-
trained model1 for parsing contemporary Swedish
text, based on the Talbanken section of the
Swedish Treebank (Nivre et al, 2006b). The
parser produces dependency trees labeled with
grammatical functions, which can be used to iden-
tify different types of complements.
3.5 Extraction of Verb Constructions
The extraction of verb constructions from the
tagged and parsed text is performed in two steps:
1. Every word form analysed as a verb by the
tagger is treated as the head of a verb con-
struction.
2. Every phrase analysed as a dependent of the
verb by the parser is treated as a complement
provided that it has a relevant grammatical
function.
The following grammatical functions are defined
to be relevant:
1. Subject (SS)
2. Direct object (OO)
3. Indirect object (IO)
1http://maltparser.org/mco/swedish parser/swemalt.html
4. Predicative complement (SP)
5. Prepositional complement (OA)
6. Infinitive complement of object (VO)
7. Verb particle (PL)
Subjects are included only if the verb has been
analysed as a passive verb by the tagger, in which
case the subject is likely to correspond to the di-
rect object in the active voice.
In an attempt to improve precision in the com-
plement extraction phase, we also use valency
dictionaries for filtering the suggested comple-
ments. The valency frame of a verb tells us what
complements the verb is likely to occur with.
The assumption is that this information could
be useful for removing unlikely complements,
i.e., complements that are not part of the valency
frame for the verb in question. The following
example illustrates the potential usefulness of this
method:
J midler tijd kom greffuinnans gotze fougte thijtt
However, the Countess? estate bailiff came there
In this case, the parser analysed the partial noun
phrase greffuinnans gotze (?the Countess? estate?)
as a direct object connected to kom (?came?).
However, since the word kom is present in the va-
lency dictionaries, we know that it is an intransi-
tive verb that does not take a direct object. Hence,
this complement can be removed. The valency
dictionaries used for filtering are:
1. The Lexin dictionary, containing 3,550 verb
lemmas with valency information.2
2. The Parole dictionary, containing 4,308 verb
lemmas with valency information.3
3. An in-house machine translation dictionary,
containing 2,852 verb lemmas with valency
information.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Data
In order to evaluate the accuracy of our method,
we have used ten texts from the period 1527?
1737. The text types covered are court records
2http://spraakbanken.gu.se/lexin/valens lexikon.html
3http://spraakdata.gu.se/parole/lexikon/swedish.parole.lexikon.html
68
and documents related to the Church. In total,
there are 444,075 tokens in the corpus, distributed
as follows (number of tokens in parentheses):
Court records:
1. Per Larssons dombok (subset),1638(11,439)
2. Hammerdals tingslag, 1649?1686 (66,928)
3. Revsunds tingslag, 1649?1689 (101,020)
4. Vendels socken, 1615?45 (59,948)
5. Vendels socken, 1736?37 (55,780)
6. O?stra ha?rads i Njudung,1602?1605(34,956)
Documents related to the Church:
1. Va?stera?s recess, 1527 (12,193)
2. 1571 a?rs kyrkoordning (49,043)
3. Uppsala mo?tes beslut, 1593 (26,969)
4. 1686 a?rs kyrkolag (25,799)
A gold standard of 40 randomly selected sen-
tences from each text was compiled, i.e., in total
400 sentences. The gold standard was produced
by manually annotating the sentences regarding
verbs and complements. Because sentences are
much longer in these texts than in contemporary
texts, the 400 sentences together contain a total of
3,105 verbs. Each word form that was interpreted
as a verb was annotated with the tag VB, and com-
plements were enclosed in brackets labeled with
their grammatical function. This is illustrated in
Figure 1, which shows an annotated segment from
the test corpus.
For comparison with contemporary text, we
make use of a subset of the Stockholm-Umea? Cor-
pus of contemporary Swedish text, SUC (Ejerhed
and Ka?llgren, 1997). This subset contains those
segments in SUC that have been syntactically
annotated and manually revised in the Swedish
Treebank. In total, the subset includes approxi-
mately 20,000 tokens. Since the tagger used in the
experiments on historical texts is trained on the
whole of SUC, we had to slightly modify the ex-
traction algorithm in order not to evaluate on the
same data as the tagger has been trained. When
testing the algorithm on contemporary text, we
therefore trained a new model for the tagger, in-
cluding all tokens in SUC except for the tokens
reserved for evaluation.

4.2 Evaluation Metrics
In order to get a more fine-grained picture of the
system?s performance, we want to evaluate three
different aspects:
1. Identification of verbs
2. Identification of complements
3. Identification of holistic verb constructions
The identification of verbs depends only on the
part-of-speech tagger and can be evaluated using
traditional precision and recall measures, compar-
ing the tokens analysed as verbs by the tagger to
the tokens analysed as verbs in the gold standard.
The identification of complements depends on
both the tagger and the parser and can also be
69
evaluated using precision and recall measures.
In this case, every complement identified by the
parser is compared to the complements annotated
in the gold standard. Precision is the number of
correct complements found by the parser divided
by the total number of complements output by
the parser, while recall is the number of correct
complements found by the parser divided by the
number of complements in the gold standard.
We do not take the labels into account when
assessing complements as correct or incorrect.
The motivation for this is that the overall aim
of the complement extraction is to present verb
expressions to historians, for them to consider
whether they are describing work activities or
not. In this context, only textual strings will
be of interest, and grammatical function labels
are ignored. For example, assume that the gold
standard is:
lefverere [IO honom] [OO Sa?dh]
deliver [IO him] [OO grain]
and that the system produces:
lefverere [OO honom]
deliver [OO him]
In this context, the complement honom (?him?)
will be regarded as correct, even though it has
been analysed as a direct object instead of an
indirect object. On the other hand, the evaluation
of complement identification is strict in that
it requires the complement found to coincide
exactly with the complement in the gold standard.
For example, assume the gold standard is:
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss do?dh]
asked [OA about her husband?s death]
and that the system produces:
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss]
asked [OA about her husband?s]
In this case, the complement will not be regarded
as correct because it does not cover exactly the
same textual string as the gold standard annota-
tion.
The identification of holistic verb construc-
tions, that is, a verb and all its complements,
depends on the identification of verbs and com-
plements, as well as the optional filtering of
complements using valency dictionaries. Here
we want to evaluate the entire text segment
extracted in a way that is relevant for the intended
application of the system. First of all, this means
that partially correct constructions should be
taken into account. Consider again the earlier
example:
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss do?dh]
asked [OA about her husband?s death]
and assume that the system produces:
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss]
asked [OA about her husband?s]
As noted above, this complement would be con-
sidered incorrect in the precision/recall evaluation
of complement extraction, even though only one
word is missing as compared to the gold standard,
and the output would probably still be valuable to
the end-user. Secondly, we should consider the to-
tal segment extracted for a verb including all com-
plements, rather than inspecting each complement
separately.
In order to reflect partially correct comple-
ments and take the total segment extracted for
each verb into account, we use a string-based
evaluation method for the identification of holis-
tic verb constructions. In this evaluation, all la-
bels and brackets are removed before comparing
the segments extracted to the segments in the text
corpus and each extracted instance is classified as
falling into one of the four following categories:
? Fully correct complement set (F)
? Partially correct complement set (P)
? Incorrect complement set (I)
? Missing complement set (M)
A complement set is regarded as fully correct if
the output string generated by the system is iden-
tical to the corresponding gold standard string.
Since labels and brackets have been removed,
these analyses will be regarded as identical:
lemnat [IO swaranden] [OO tid]
given [IO the defendant] [OO time]
70
lemnat [OO swaranden tid]
given [OO the defendant time]
A complement set is regarded as partially correct
if the output string generated by the system has a
non-empty overlap with the corresponding gold
standard string. For example, the following three
sets of analyses will be considered as partially
correct (gold standard top, system output bottom):
lefverere [IO honom] [OO Sa?dh]
deliver [IO him] [OO Grain]
lefverere [OO honom]
deliver [OO him]
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss do?dh]
asked [OA about her husband?s death]
effterfra?gat [OA om sinss manss]
asked [OA about her husband?s]
betale [PL a?ter] [IO ha?r Mattz] [OO Ra?gen]
pay [PL back] [IO mister Mattz] [OO the Rye]
betale [OO a?ter ha?r Mattz]
pay [OO back mister Mattz]
A (non-empty) complement set is regarded as in-
correct if the output string has no overlap with the
gold standard string. Finally, a complement set is
regarded as missing if the output string is empty
but the gold standard string is not. It is worth not-
ing that the four categories are mutually exclusive.
5 Results and Discussion
In this section, we evaluate the identification of
verbs, complements and holistic verb construc-
tions using the data and metrics described in the
previous section.
5.1 Verbs
Results on the identification of verbs using part-
of-speech tagging, with and without normalisa-
tion, are reported in Table 2. As can be seen, recall
drastically increases when normalisation rules are
applied prior to tagging, even though the normal-
isation rules used in this experiment are formu-
lated based on a subset of one single 17th cen-
tury text, and the test corpus contains samples of
various text types ranging from 1527?1737. Nor-
malisation also has a small positive effect on pre-
cision, and the best result for historical texts is
78.4% precision and 76.0% recall. This is slightly

Raw 75.4 60.0 66.9
Norm 78.4 76.0 77.2

normalised input text. Norm = Normalisation of input

section 4.1.
lower than the results presented by Pettersson and
Nivre (2011) where only 17th century text was
used for evaluation, indicating that the normalisa-
tion rules are somewhat biased towards 17th cen-
tury text, and that the results could be improved
if normalisation were adapted to specific time pe-
riods. It is also worth noting that the results are
substantially lower for historical text than the re-
sults for contemporary text, with precision and re-
call at 99.1%, but still high enough to be useful in
the intended context of application.
Tokens that are still erroneously analysed by
the tagger include the following cases:
? tokens where the old spelling is identical
to an existing, but different, word form
in contemporary language; for example,
the spelling skal would in contemporary
language be considered a noun (?shell?)
but in the old texts this spelling is used
for a word that is nowadays spelled skall
(?shall/should?) and should be regarded as a
verb;
? ambiguous words; for example, past partici-
ples are often spelled the same way as the
corresponding past tense verb, but participles
are not regarded as verb forms in our experi-
ments;4
? tokens that have not been normalised enough
and thus do not correspond to a word form
recognised by the tagger, e.g., the word
form lemnas which in contemporary lan-
guage should be spelled as la?mnas (?be
left?).
4Participles are only used adjectivally in Swedish, as the
perfect tense is formed using a distinct supine form of the
verb.

5.2 Complements
Recall and precision for the identification of com-
plements using parsing are presented in Table 3.
In this case, normalisation has a smaller effect
than in the case of tagging and affects precision
more than recall. Adding a filter that eliminates
unlikely complements based on the valency frame
of the verb in existing dictionaries predictably im-
proves precision at the expense of recall and re-
sults in a small F-score improvement.
Again, the best scores on the historical texts
are much lower than the corresponding results for
contemporary text, with an F-score of 28.8% in
the former case and 69.5% in the latter, but it is
worth remembering that precision and recall on
exactly matching complements is a harsh metric
that is not directly relevant for the intended appli-
cation. Finally, it is worth noting that the valency
filter has a large negative impact on recall for the
modern texts, resulting in a decrease in the F-
score, which indicates that the parser in this case
is quite successful at identifying complements (in
the wide sense) that are not covered by the va-
lency dictionaries.
5.3 Verb Constructions
As argued in section 4.2, precision and recall mea-
sures are not sufficient for evaluating the extrac-
tion of holistic verb constructions. A more rele-
vant assessment is made by counting the number
of fully correct, partially correct, incorrect and
missing complement sets for the verbs identified.
Table 4 summarises the results in accordance with
this metric.
First of all, we see that normalisation again has
a rather small effect on overall results, increas-

ing the number of fully correct constructions and
decreasing the number of incorrect constructions,
but also leading to an increase in the number of
missing complements. Adding the valency fil-
ter to remove unlikely complements has a simi-
lar effect and increases the percentage of correctly
extracted verb constructions to 38.7% while de-
creasing the share of incorrect constructions to
18.9%. However, it also increases the percent-
age of verbs with missing complement sets from
20.8% to 25.5%. This is partly due to the fact
that some of the verbs are used in a slightly dif-
ferent way in historical text as compared to con-
temporary text, meaning that the valency frames
are not as reliable. For example, the verb avsta?
(?refrain?) in the historical corpus is used with a
direct object, as in Anders Andersson afsta?dt sitt
skatte hemman (?Anders Andersson refrained his
homestead?), whereas in a contemporary context
this verb would more likely be used with a prepo-
sitional complement, avsta? fra?n na?gonting (?re-
frain from something?).
In total, 55.6% of the verbs are assigned a fully
or partially correct set of complements. This is
again lower than the result for contemporary texts
(78.7%), but the difference is smaller than for the
previous metrics, which is encouraging given that
the evaluation in this section is most relevant for
the intended application. Moreover, it is worth
noting that the difference is mostly to be found
in the category of partially correct constructions,
where the best result for modern texts is 54.2%,
to be compared to 16.9% for the historical texts.
With respect to fully correct constructions, how-
ever, the results are actually better for the histor-
72
ical texts than for the modern texts, 38.7% vs.
30.8%, a rather surprising positive result.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a method for automatically ex-
tracting verbs and their complements from histor-
ical Swedish texts, more precisely texts from the
Early Modern era (1550?1800), with the aim of
providing language technology support for histor-
ical research. We have shown that it is possible
to use existing contemporary NLP tools and dic-
tionaries for this purpose, provided that the input
text is first (automatically) normalised to a more
modern spelling. With the best configuration of
our tools, we can identify verbs with an F-score
of 77.2% and find a partially or completely cor-
rect set of complements for 55.6% of the verbs.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
results of their kind.
In addition to presenting a method for the iden-
tification of verb constructions, we have also pro-
posed a new evaluation framework for such meth-
ods in the context of information extraction for
historical research. As a complement to standard
precision and recall metrics for verbs and their
complements, we have evaluated the text seg-
ments extracted using the categories fully correct,
partially correct, incorrect, and missing. One
important topic for future research is to validate
this evaluation framework by correlating it to the
perceived usefulness of the system when used
by historians working on the Gender and Work
Database. Preliminary experiments using a proto-
type system indicate that this kind of support can
in fact reduce the time-consuming, manual work
that is currently carried out by historians and other
researchers working with older texts.
Another topic for future research concerns the
variation in performance across time periods and
text types. In the current evaluation, court records
and papers related to the Church ranging from
1527 to 1737 have been sampled in the gold stan-
dard. It would be interesting to explore in more
detail how the program performs on the oldest
texts as compared to the youngest texts, and on
court records as compared to the other genres.
