Abstract
This paper presents the first round of the
task on Cross-lingual Textual Entailment for
Content Synchronization, organized within
SemEval-2012. The task was designed to pro-
mote research on semantic inference over texts
written in different languages, targeting at the
same time a real application scenario. Par-
ticipants were presented with datasets for dif-
ferent language pairs, where multi-directional
entailment relations (?forward?, ?backward?,
?bidirectional?, ?no entailment?) had to be
identified. We report on the training and test
data used for evaluation, the process of their
creation, the participating systems (10 teams,
92 runs), the approaches adopted and the re-
sults achieved.
1 Introduction
The cross-lingual textual entailment task (Mehdad et
al., 2010) addresses textual entailment (TE) recog-
nition (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) under the new
dimension of cross-linguality, and within the new
challenging application scenario of content synchro-
nization.
Cross-linguality represents a dimension of the TE
recognition problem that has been so far only par-
tially investigated. The great potential for integrat-
ing monolingual TE recognition components into
NLP architectures has been reported in several ar-
eas, including question answering, information re-
trieval, information extraction, and document sum-
marization. However, mainly due to the absence of
cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) recognition
components, similar improvements have not been
achieved yet in any cross-lingual application. The
CLTE task aims at prompting research to fill this
gap. Along such direction, research can now ben-
efit from recent advances in other fields, especially
machine translation (MT), and the availability of: i)
large amounts of parallel and comparable corpora in
many languages, ii) open source software to com-
pute word-alignments from parallel corpora, and iii)
open source software to set up MT systems. We
believe that all these resources can positively con-
tribute to develop inference mechanisms for multi-
lingual data.
Content synchronization represents a challenging
application scenario to test the capabilities of ad-
vanced NLP systems. Given two documents about
the same topic written in different languages (e.g.
Wiki pages), the task consists of automatically de-
tecting and resolving differences in the information
they provide, in order to produce aligned, mutually
enriched versions of the two documents. Towards
this objective, a crucial requirement is to identify the
information in one page that is either equivalent or
novel (more informative) with respect to the content
of the other. The task can be naturally cast as an
entailment recognition problem, where bidirectional
and unidirectional entailment judgments for two text
fragments are respectively mapped into judgments
about semantic equivalence and novelty. Alterna-
tively, the task can be seen as a machine translation
evaluation problem, where judgments about seman-
tic equivalence and novelty depend on the possibility
to fully or partially translate a text fragment into the
other.

?no entailment? judgments for SP/EN CLTE pairs.
The recent advances on monolingual TE on the
one hand, and the methodologies used in Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) on the other, offer
promising solutions to approach the CLTE task. In
line with a number of systems that model the RTE
task as a similarity problem (i.e. handling similar-
ity scores between T and H as useful evidence to
draw entailment decisions), the standard sentence
and word alignment programs used in SMT offer a
strong baseline for CLTE. However, although repre-
senting a solid starting point to approach the prob-
lem, similarity-based techniques are just approx-
imations, open to significant improvements com-
ing from semantic inference at the multilingual
level (e.g. cross-lingual entailment rules such as
?perro???animal?). Taken in isolation, similarity-
based techniques clearly fall short of providing an
effective solution to the problem of assigning direc-
tions to the entailment relations (especially in the
complex CLTE scenario, where entailment relations
are multi-directional). Thanks to the contiguity be-
tween CLTE, TE and SMT, the proposed task pro-
vides an interesting scenario to approach the issues
outlined above from different perspectives, and large
room for mutual improvement.
2 The task
Given a pair of topically related text fragments (T1
and T2) in different languages, the CLTE task con-
sists of automatically annotating it with one of the
following entailment judgments (see Figure 1 for
Spanish/English examples of each judgment):
? bidirectional (T1?T2 & T1?T2): the two
fragments entail each other (semantic equiva-
lence);
? forward (T1?T2 & T16?T2): unidirectional
entailment from T1 to T2;
? backward (T16?T2 & T1?T2): unidirectional
entailment from T2 to T1;
? no entailment (T16?T2 & T16?T2): there is
no entailment between T1 and T2 in both direc-
tions;
In this task, both T1 and T2 are assumed to be
true statements. Although contradiction is relevant
from an application-oriented perspective, contradic-
tory pairs are not present in the dataset created for
the first round of the task.
3 Dataset description
Four CLTE corpora have been created for the fol-
lowing language combinations: Spanish/English
(SP-EN), Italian/English (IT-EN), French/English
(FR-EN), German/English (DE-EN). The datasets
are released in the XML format shown in Figure 1.
3.1 Data collection and annotation
The dataset was created following the crowdsourc-
ing methodology proposed in (Negri et al., 2011),
which consists of the following steps:
1. First, English sentences were manually ex-
tracted from copyright-free sources (Wikipedia
and Wikinews). The selected sentences repre-
sent one of the elements (T1) of each entail-
ment pair;
2. Next, each T1 was modified through crowd-
sourcing in various ways in order to ob-
tain a corresponding T2 (e.g. introduc-
ing meaning-preserving lexical and syntactic
changes, adding and removing portions of
text);
3. Each T2 was then paired to the original T1,
and the resulting pairs were annotated with one
of the four entailment judgments. In order to
reduce the correlation between the difference
in sentences? length and entailment judgments,
400
only the pairs where the difference between the
number of words in T1 and T2 (length diff ) was
below a fixed threshold (10 words) were re-
tained.1 The final result is a monolingual En-
glish dataset annotated with multi-directional
entailment judgments, which are well dis-
tributed over length diff values ranging from 0
to 9;
4. In order to create the cross-lingual datasets,
each English T1 was manually translated into
four different languages (i.e. Spanish, German,
Italian and French) by expert translators;
5. By pairing the translated T1 with the cor-
responding T2 in English, four cross-lingual
datasets were obtained.
To ensure the good quality of the datasets, all the
collected pairs were manually checked and corrected
when necessary. Only pairs with agreement between
two expert annotators were retained. The final result
is a multilingual parallel entailment corpus, where
T1s are in 5 different languages (i.e. English, Span-
ish, German, Italian, and French), and T2s are in En-
glish. It?s worth mentioning that the monolingual
English corpus, a by-product of our data collection
methodology, will be publicly released as a further
contribution to the research community.2
3.2 Dataset statistics
Each dataset consists of 1,000 pairs (500 for training
and 500 for test), balanced across the four entail-
ment judgments (bidirectional, forward, backward,
and no entailment).
For each language combination, the distribu-
tion of the four entailment judgments according to
length diff is shown in Figure 2. Vertical bars rep-
resent, for each length diff value, the proportion
of pairs belonging to the four entailment classes.
As can be seen, the length diff constraint applied
to the length difference in the monolingual English
1Such constraint has been applied in order to focus as much
as possible on semantic aspects of the problem, by reduc-
ing the applicability of simple association rules such as IF
length(T1)>length(T2) THEN T1?T2.

to non participants in July 2012.
pairs (step 3 of the creation process) is substantially
reflected in the cross-lingual datasets for all lan-
guage combinations. In fact, as shown in Table 1,
the majority of the pairs is always included in the
same length diff range (approximately [-5,+5]) and,
within this range, the distribution of the four classes
is substantially uniform. Our assumption is that such
data distribution makes entailment judgments based
on mere surface features such as sentence length in-
effective, thus encouraging the development of alter-
native, deeper processing strategies.

4 Evaluation metrics and baselines
Evaluation results have been automatically com-
puted by comparing the entailment judgments re-
turned by each system with those manually assigned
by human annotators. The metric used for systems?
ranking is accuracy over the whole test set, i.e. the
number of correct judgments out of the total number
of judgments in the test set. Additionally, we calcu-
lated precision, recall, and F1 measures for each of
the four entailment judgment categories taken sep-
arately. These scores aim at giving participants the
possibility to gain clearer insights into their system?s
behavior on the entailment phenomena relevant to
the task.
For each language combination, two baselines
considering the length difference between T1 and T2
have been calculated (besides the trivial 0.25 accu-
racy score obtained by assigning each test pair in the
balanced dataset to one of the four classes):
? Composition of binary judgments (Bi-
nary). To calculate this baseline an SVM
classifier is trained to take binary entailment
decisions (?YES?, ?NO?). The classifier uses
length(T1)/length(T2) as a single feature to
check for entailment from T1 to T2, and
length(T2)/length(T1) for the opposite direc-
tion. For each test pair, the unidirectional

judgments returned by the two classifiers are
composed into a single multi-directional judg-
ment (?YES-YES?=?bidirectional?, ?YES-
NO?=?forward?, ?NO-YES?=?backward?,
?NO-NO?=?no entailment?);
? Multi-class classification (Multi-class). A
single SVM classifier is trained with the same
features to directly assign to each pair one of
the four entailment judgments.
Both the baselines have been calculated with the
LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2011), using a
linear kernel with default parameters. Baseline re-
sults are reported in Table 2.
Although the four CLTE datasets are derived from
the same monolingual EN-EN corpus, baseline re-
sults present slight differences due to the effect of
translation into different languages.

5 Submitted runs and results
Participants were allowed to submit up to five runs
for each language combination. A total of 17 teams
registered to participate in the task and downloaded
the training set. Out of them, 12 downloaded the
test set and 10 (including one of the task organizers)
submitted valid runs. Eight teams produced submis-
sions for all the language combinations, while two
teams participated only in the SP-EN task. In total,
92 runs have been submitted and evaluated (29 for
SP-EN, and 21 for each of the other language pairs).

Despite the novelty and the difficulty of the problem,
these numbers demonstrate the interest raised by the
task, and the overall success of the initiative.

Table 3: Accuracy results (92 runs) over the 4 lan-
guage combinations. Highest, average, median and low-
est scores are calculated considering the best run for each
team (*task organizers? system).
Accuracy results are reported in Table 3. As can
be seen from the table, overall accuracy scores are
quite different across language pairs, with the high-
est result on SP-EN (0.632), which is considerably
higher than the highest score on DE-EN (0.558).
This might be due to the fact that most of the partic-
ipating systems rely on a ?pivoting? approach that
addresses CLTE by automatically translating T1 in
the same language of T2 (see Section 6). Regard-
ing the DE-EN dataset, pivoting methods might be
penalized by the lower quality of MT output when
German T1s are translated into English.
The comparison with baselines results leads to in-
teresting observations. First of all, while all systems
significantly outperform the lowest 1-class baseline
(0.25), both other baselines are surprisingly hard to
beat. This shows that, despite the effort in keep-
ing the distribution of the entailment classes uni-
form across different length diff values, eliminating
the correlation between sentences? length and cor-
rect entailment decisions is difficult. As a conse-
quence, although disregarding semantic aspects of
the problem, features considering such information
are quite effective.
In general, systems performed better on the SP-
EN dataset, with most results above the binary base-
line (8 out of 10), and half of the systems above the
multi-class baseline. For the other language pairs
the results are lower, with only 3 out of 8 partici-
pants above the two baselines in all datasets. Aver-
age results reflect this situation: the average scores
are always above the binary baseline, whereas only
the SP-EN average result is higher than the multi-
class baseline(0.44 vs. 0.43).
To better understand the behaviour of each sys-
tem (also in relation to the different language com-
binations), Table 4 provides separate precision, re-
call, and F1 scores for each entailment judgment,
calculated over the best runs of each participating
team. Overall, the results suggest that the ?bidi-
rectional? and ?no entailment? categories are more
problematic than ?forward? and ?backward? judg-
ments. For most datasets, in fact, systems? perfor-
mance on ?bidirectional? and ?no entailment? is sig-
nificantly lower, typically on recall. Except for the
DE-EN dataset (more problematic on ?forward?),
also average F1 results on these judgments are lower.
This might be due to the fact that, for all datasets, the
vast majority of ?bidirectional? and ?no entailment?
judgments falls in a length diff range where the dis-
tribution of the four classes is more uniform (see
Figure 2).
Similar reasons can justify the fact that ?back-
ward? entailment results are consistently higher on
all datasets. Compared with ?forward? entailment,
these judgments are in fact less scattered across the
entire length diff range (i.e. less intermingled with
the other classes).

6 Approaches
A rough classification of the approaches adopted by
participants can be made along two orthogonal di-
mensions, namely:
? Pivoting vs. Cross-lingual. Pivoting meth-
ods rely on the automatic translation of one of
the two texts (either single words or the en-
tire sentence) into the language of the other
(typically English) in order perform monolin-
gual TE recognition. Cross-lingual methods as-
sign entailment judgments without preliminary
translation.
? Composition of binary judgments vs. Multi-
class classification. Compositional approaches
map unidirectional entailment decisions taken
separately into single judgments (similar to the
Binary baseline in Section 4). Methods based
on multi-class classification directly assign one
of the four entailment judgments to each test
pair (similar to our Multi-class baseline).
Concerning the former dimension, most of the
systems (6 out of 10) adopted a pivoting approach,
relying on Google Translate (4 systems), Microsoft
Bing Translator (1), or a combination of Google,
Bing, and other MT systems (1) to produce English
T2s. Regarding the latter dimension, the composi-
tional approach was preferred to multi-class classi-
fication (6 out of 10). The best performing system
relies on a ?hybrid? approach (combining monolin-
gual and cross-lingual alignments) and a compo-
sitional strategy. Besides the frequent recourse to
MT tools, other resources used by participants in-
clude: on-line dictionaries for the translation of sin-
gle words, word alignment tools, part-of-speech tag-
gers, NP chunkers, named entity recognizers, stem-
mers, stopwords lists, and Wikipedia as an external
multilingual corpus. More in detail:
BUAP [pivoting, compositional] (Vilarin?o et al.,
2012) adopts a pivoting method based on translating
T1 into the language of T2 and vice versa (Google
Translate3 and the OpenOffice Thesaurus4). Simi-
larity measures (e.g. Jaccard index) and rules are
3http://translate.google.com/
4http://extensions.services.openoffice.
org/en/taxonomy/term/233
respectively used to annotate the two resulting sen-
tence pairs with entailment judgments and combine
them in a single decision.
CELI [cross lingual, compositional & multi-
class] (Kouylekov, 2012) uses dictionaries for word
matching, and a multilingual corpus extracted from
Wikipedia for term weighting. Word overlap and
similarity measures are then used in different ap-
proaches to the task. In one run (Run 1), they are
used to train a classifier that assigns separate en-
tailment judgments for each direction. Such judg-
ments are finally composed into a single one for each
pair. In the other runs, the same features are used for
multi-class classification.
DirRelCond3 [cross lingual, compositional]
(Perini, 2012) uses bilingual dictionaries (Freedict5
and WordReference6) to translate content words into
English. Then, entailment decisions are taken com-
bining directional relatedness scores between words
in both directions (Perini, 2011).
FBK [cross lingual, compositional & multi-
class] (Mehdad et al., 2012a) uses cross-lingual
matching features extracted from lexical phrase ta-
bles, semantic phrase tables, and dependency rela-
tions (Mehdad et al., 2011; Mehdad et al., 2012b;
Mehdad et al., 2012c). The features are used for
multi-class and binary classification using SVMs.
HDU [hybrid, compositional] (Wa?schle and
Fendrich, 2012) uses a combination of binary clas-
sifiers for each entailment direction. The classifiers
use both monolingual alignment features based on
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) alignments
(translations obtained from Google Translate), and
cross-lingual alignment features based on GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2000) (word alignments learned on
Europarl).
ICT [pivoting, compositional] (Meng et al.,
2012) adopts a pivoting method (using Google
Translate and an in-house hierarchical MT system),
and the open source EDITS system (Kouylekov and
Negri, 2010) to calculate similarity scores between
monolingual English pairs. Separate unidirectional
entailment judgments obtained from binary classi-
fier are combined to return one of the four valid
CLTE judgments.

Table 4: precision, recall and F1 scores, calculated for each team?s best run for all the language combinations.
JU-CSE-NLP [pivoting, compositional] (Neogi
et al., 2012) uses Microsoft Bing translator7 to pro-
duce monolingual English pairs. Separate lexical
mapping scores are calculated (from T1 to T2 and
vice-versa) considering different types of informa-
tion and similarity metrics. Binary entailment de-

cisions are then heuristically combined into single
decisions.
Sagan [pivoting, multi-class] (Castillo and Car-
denas, 2012) adopts a pivoting method using Google
Translate, and trains a monolingual system based on
a SVM multi-class classifier. A CLTE corpus de-
rived from the RTE-3 dataset is also used as a source
of additional training material.

SoftCard [pivoting, multi-class] (Jimenez et al.,
2012) after automatic translation with Google Trans-
late, uses SVMs to learn entailment decisions based
on information about the cardinality of: T1, T2, their
intersection and their union. Cardinalities are com-
puted in different ways, considering tokens in T1 and
T2, their IDF, and their similarity (computed with
edit-distance)
UAlacant [pivoting, multi-class] (Espla`-Gomis
et al., 2012) exploits translations obtained from
Google Translate, Microsoft Bing translator, and the
Apertium open-source MT platform (Forcada et al.,
2011).8 Then, a multi-class SVM classifier is used
to take entailment decisions using information about
overlapping sub-segments as features.
7 Conclusion
Despite the novelty of the problem and the diffi-
culty to capture multi-directional entailment rela-
tions across languages, the first round of the Cross-
lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchroniza-
tion task organized within SemEval-2012 was a suc-
cessful experience. This year a new interesting chal-
lenge has been proposed, a benchmark for four lan-
guage combinations has been released, baseline re-
sults have been proposed for comparison, and a
monolingual English dataset has been produced as
a by-product which can be useful for monolingual
TE research. The interest shown by participants
was encouraging: 10 teams submitted a total of 92
runs for all the language pairs proposed. Overall,
the results achieved on all datasets are encourag-
ing, with best systems significantly outperforming
the proposed baselines. It is worth observing that the
nature of the task, which lies between semantics and
machine translation, led to the participation of teams
coming from both these communities, showing in-
teresting opportunities for integration and mutual
improvement. The proposed approaches reflect this
situation, with teams traditionally working on MT
now dealing with entailment, and teams tradition-
ally participating in the RTE challenges now dealing
with cross-lingual alignment techniques. Our ambi-
tion, for the future editions of the CLTE task, is to
further consolidate the bridge between the semantics
and MT communities.
