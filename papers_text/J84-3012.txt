Take a few nanoseconds  
to explore the roots 
of comput ing 
In the rush to carry on the work 
of the information age, it is wise for 
computer professionals to regularly 
look back at the beginnings of the 
computer evolution. 
While viewing the history of com- 
puters may seem a luxury in the face 
of an ever-changing environment, it
is surprising how rich this history is 
in terms of wheels already invented 
and common problems already solved. 
It is also ironic that many computer 
professionals--who have dedicated 
themselves to processing information 
at a rapid speed to save time for end 
users--avoid sitting back and pon- 
dering the historic value of their work. 
The American Federation of In- 
formation Processing Societies, Inc., 
has a publication that can provide a 
valuable window to yesterday. 
Computing's "roots" 
The Annals of the History of 
Computing isa documentation f the 
"roots" of this relatively new profes- 
sion. 
This unique publication appears 
four times a year, with contributors 
exploring the evolution of the com- 
puter and the people who have as- 
sisted in its development and accept- 
ance within business and society. 
There are numerous advantages to
being a regular reader of the Annals 
of the History of Computing. 
For example, time spent perusing 
the Annals provides avaluable insight 
into the information mangement 
profession and its future directions. 
In addition, reading about the prim- 
itive technologies designed by the 
pioneers in the field can be an amus- 
ing experience in light of what is 
known today. 
However, and more important, if 
computer professionals cast away the 
advantage of hindsight and put them- 
selves into those early environments 
of discovery, these professionals then 
build an affinity with their predeces- 
sors--and they develop more creative 
approaches to the problems of proc- 
essing information. 
Contemporary solutions 
In short, what numerous readers 
of the Annals of the History of Com- 
puting are finding out is that there 
are solutions to contemporary prob- 
lems to be found in the historic review 
of the field and its early leaders. 
"Just as we look to the historian of 
government for a better understand- 
ing of government, and to the his- 
torian of art for a better understanding 
of art, so we are entitled to look to 
the historian of technology for a better 
understanding of technology." That 
view belongs to management con- 
sultant Peter Drucker, in an article 
which appears in the October 1982 
Annals. 
For those people who see history 
as the happenings of men and women 
thousands of years ago, the history of 
computers may seem to be rushing 
things a bit. 
Since the field emerged only about 
35 years ago, any attempt at creating 
a historic perspective might appear, 
premature. Yet, the historic analysis 
of the profession's work, as published 
in the Annals, among other maga- 
zines and books, is one vehicle which 
will aid in the maturing of the profes- 
sion as well as its visibility with the 
public. 
It is time to reflect on the potent 
history of the computer and its ability 
to process information. 
By subscribing to the Annals of the 
History of Computing, you can relive 
an exciting era of modern history.

Guide l ines  fo r  Submiss ions  
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size 
paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and 
references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 
150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. 
Submissions may be made in any of the fol lowing categories: 
PAPER:  This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in 
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular 
topic. The length of a paper depends on itscontent,  but we suggest that manuscripts be 
limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages. 
Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and 
usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. 
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the 
manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to 
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a 
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the 
Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for 
publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the 
authors or, in the case of a "work for hire", by the employer. This written transfer is 
necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. 
TECHNICAL  CORRESPONDENCE:  This category includes short articles reporting 
preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest 
to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double- 
spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the 
editorial board before acceptance. 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:  This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these 
contributions for inclusion. 
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor: 
James F. Allen, CL Editor 
Department of Computer Science 
The University of Rochester 
Rochester, NY 14627 
arpanet: ACL@ROCHESTER 
Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact 
the Book Review Editor; publishers may also submit copies of books for review directly to 
the Book Review Editor: 
Madeleine Bates, CL Book Review Editor 
Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. 
10 Moulton St 
Cambridge, MA 02238 
arpanet: BATES@BBNG 
The Finite String Editor should receive (a) copies of technical reports and reprints of 
papers published elsewhere - or at least citation information and abstracts of such items 
and of books and monographs; (b) summaries of research in progress - of particular 
interest would be perspectives on the activities at a particular institution; (c) announce- 
ments of meetings of potential interest to the membership; and (d) personal notes (e.g., 
honors, moving, changes in status). Two copies of submissions should be sent to the 
Finite String Editor: 
Ralph Weischedel, Finite String Editor

University of Delaware 
Newark, NJ 19716 
arpanet: WEISCHEDEL@UDEL 
Fuller instructions about the format of submissions can be found in the first issue of each 
volume. 
The Association for  Computational Linguistics is an international scientific and professional 
society with membership open to any person or institution whose professional goals relate to computational 
linguistics. For information on dues and payments, see the inside front cover.
