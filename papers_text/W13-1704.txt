Abstract
Automated feedback on writing may be a use-
ful complement to teacher comments in the
process of learning a foreign language. This
paper presents a self-assessment and tutoring
system which combines an holistic score with
detection and correction of frequent errors and
furthermore provides a qualitative assessment
of each individual sentence, thus making the
language learner aware of potentially prob-
lematic areas rather than providing a panacea.
The system has been tested by learners in
a range of educational institutions, and their
feedback has guided its development.
1 Introduction
Learning to write a foreign language well requires
a considerable amount of practice and appropriate
feedback. Good teachers are essential, but their time
is limited. As recently shown in a study by Wang et
al. (in press) conducted amongst first-year students
of English at a Taiwanese university, automated
writing evaluation can lead to increased learner au-
tonomy and higher writing accuracy. In this pa-
per, we investigate the merits of a self-assessment
and tutoring (SAT) system specifically aimed at in-
termediate learners of English, at around B2 level
in the Common European Framework of Reference
for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001).
There are a large number of students at this level,
and they should have sufficient knowledge of the
language to benefit from the system whilst at the
same time committing errors which can be identified
reliably.
The system provides automated feedback on
learners? writing at three different levels of gran-
ularity: an overall assessment of their proficiency,
a score for each individual sentence, highlighting
well-written passages as well as ones requiring more
work, and specific comments on local issues includ-
ing spelling and word choice.
Computer-based writing tools have been around
for a long time, with Criterion (Burstein et al, 2003,
which also provides a number of features for teach-
ers) and ESL Assistant (Gamon et al, 2009, not
currently available) aimed specifically at second-
language learners, but the idea of indicating the rel-
ative quality of different parts of a text (sentences in
our case) has, to the best of our knowledge, not been
implemented previously. This kind of non-specific
feedback does not provide a precise diagnosis or im-
mediate cure, but might have the advantage of fos-
tering learning.
In addition to describing the SAT system itself, we
present a series of three trials in which learners of
English in a number of educational contexts used the
system as a tool to work on written responses to spe-
cific tasks and improve their writing skills.
2 System
The SAT system is made available to students learn-
ing English as a Web service to which they can
sign up with a code (?class key?) provided by their
teacher. Once they have filled in a short demo-
graphic questionnaire, the users can respond to one,
two, three or more writing tasks. The students can
save their work at any time and ask the system to
assess the current version of their text, which will

?score feedback? and ?error feedback? views are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
give feedback as shown in Figure 1 and described
in more detail in the following subsections. Assess-
ment times are currently around 15sec, which facil-
itates incremental and exploratory editing of a text
to improve it, giving the students the ability to try
out different ways of correcting a problematic turn
of phrase. The teacher can see which students have
signed up and look at the last saved version of their
responses. Finally, the students are asked to answer
a few questions about their experience with the sys-
tem.
2.1 Text assessment
The SAT system provides an overall assessment of
someone?s proficiency by automatically analysing
and scoring the text as a whole. There is a large
body of literature with regard to automated text scor-
ing systems (Page, 1968; Rudner and Liang, 2002;
Attali and Burstein, 2006; Briscoe et al, 2010). Ex-
isting systems, overviews of which have been pub-
lished in various studies (Dikli, 2006; Williamson,
2009; Shermis and Hamner, 2012), involve a large
range of techniques, such as discriminative and gen-
erative machine learning, clustering algorithms and
vectorial semantics, as well as syntactic parsers.
We approach automated text assessment as a su-
pervised machine learning problem, which enables
us to take advantage of existing annotated data. We
use the publically-available First Certificate in En-
glish (FCE) dataset of upper-intermediate learner En-
glish (Yannakoudakis et al, 2011) and focus on as-
sessing general linguistic competence. Systems that
measure English competence directly are easier and
faster to deploy, since they are more likely to be re-
usable and generalise better across different genres
than topic-specific ones, which are not immediately
33
usable when new tasks are added, since the model
cannot be applied until a substantial amount of man-
ually annotated responses have been collected for a
specific prompt.
Following previous research, we employ discrim-
inative ranking, which has been shown to achieve
state-of-the-art results on the task of assessing
free-text writing competence (Yannakoudakis et al,
2011). The underlying idea is that high-scoring texts
(or ?scripts?) should receive a higher rank than low-
scoring ones. We train a linear ranking perceptron
(Bo?s and Opper, 1998) on features derived from pre-
vious work (namely, lexical and grammatical prop-
erties of text) and compare it to our previous model
(Yannakoudakis et al, 2011), which is trained using
ranking Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 2002).
Our new perceptron model achieves 0.740 and 0.765
Pearson product-moment (r) and Spearman?s rank
correlation coefficient (?) respectively between the
gold and predicted scores; this is comparable to
our previous SVM model, which achieves 0.741 and
0.773, and the differences are not significant.
In order to provide scoring feedback1 based on
the predictions of our model, we use visual presen-
tations. Visualisation techniques allow us to go be-
yond the mere display of a number, can stimulate the
learners? visual perceptions, and, when used appro-
priately, information can be displayed in an intuitive
and easily interpretable way. Furthermore, aesthet-
ics in computer-based interfaces have been shown to
have an effect on the users. For example, Ben-Bassat
et al (2006) have found an interdependence between
perceived aesthetics and usability in questionnaire-
based assessments, and have shown that users? pref-
erences are not necessarily based only upon perfor-
mance; aesthetics also play a role.
More specifically, we assign an overall score on
a scale from red for a text that looks like it may be
at intermediate level or below to green for a text that
shows some evidence of being at upper-intermediate
level (the level assessed by the FCE exam) or above
(i.e., advanced). This is illustrated in Figure 1 below
the Overall score section, where an arrow is used to
indicate the level of text quality on a colour gradient
defined by the two extreme points, red and green.
1Note that ranks can be transformed to scores through linear
regression, while correlation remains unaltered as it is invariant
to linear transformations.
A text with the highest score possible would indi-
cate that the learner has potentially shown evidence
of being at a level higher than that assessed by FCE,
the latter, of course, being dependent on the extent
to which higher-order linguistic skills are elicited by
the prompts. On the contrary, a very low score in-
dicates poor linguistic abilities corresponding to a
lower level.
Although exams that encompass the full range of
language proficiency exhibited at different stages of
learning are hard to design, the FCE exam, bench-
marked at the B2 level and reserving some of its
score range for performances beneath and beyond,
allows us to roughly estimate someone?s proficiency
as being far below, just below, around or above an
upper intermediate level. The task of predicting at-
tainment levels has recently started to receive atten-
tion (Dickinson et al, 2012; Hawkins and Filipovic?,
2012).
2.2 Sentence evaluation
The second component of the SAT system automat-
ically assesses and scores the quality of individual
sentences, independently of their context. The chal-
lenge of assessing intra-sentential quality lies in the
limited linguistic evidence that can be extracted au-
tomatically from relatively short sentences for them
to be assessed reliably, in addition to the difficulty
in acquiring annotated data, since rating a response
sentence by sentence is not something examiners
typically do and would therefore require an addi-
tional and expensive manual annotation effort.
Previous work has primarily focused on automatic
content scoring of short answers, ranging from a few
words to a few sentences (Pulman and Sukkarieh,
2005; Attali et al, 2008; Mohler et al, 2011; Ziai
et al, 2012). On the other hand, scoring of individ-
ual sentences with respect to their linguistic quality,
specifically in learner texts, has received consider-
ably less attention. Higgins et al (2004) devised
guidelines for the manual annotation of sentences in
learner texts, and evaluated a rule-based approach
that classifies sentences with respect to clarity of ex-
pression based on grammar, mechanics and word us-
age errors; however, their system performs binary
classification, whereas we are focusing on scoring
sentences. Writing instruction tools, such as Crite-
rion (Burstein et al, 2003), give advice on stylistic
34
and organisational issues and automatically detect a
variety of errors in the text, though they do not ex-
plicitly allow for an overall evaluation of sentences
with respect to various writing aspects. The latter,
used in combination with an error feedback compo-
nent (see Section 2.3), can be a useful instrument
informing learners about the severity of their mis-
takes; for example, although sentences may contain
some errors, they may still maintain a certain level
of acceptability that does not impede communica-
tion. Moreover, indicating problematic regions may
be better from a pedagogic point of view than detect-
ing and correcting all errors identified in the text.
To date, there is no publically available annotated
dataset consisting of sentences marked with a score
representing their linguistic quality. Manual annota-
tion is typically expensive and time-consuming, and
a certain amount of annotator training is generally
required. Instead, we exploit already available an-
notated data ? scores and error annotation in the FCE
dataset ? and evaluate various approaches, two of
which are: a) to use the script-level model (see Sec-
tion 2.1) to predict sentence quality scores, and b) to
use the script-level score divided by the total num-
ber of (manually annotated) errors in a sentence as
pseudo-gold labels to train a sentence-level model.
As the models above are expected to contain a cer-
tain amount of noise, it is imperative that we iden-
tify evaluation measures that are indicative of our
application ? that is, assign higher scores to high-
quality sentences compared to low-quality ones ?
and not only depend on the labels they have been
trained on. More specifically, we use correlation
with pseudo-gold scores (rg and ?g; not applicable
to the script-level model), correlation with the script-
level scores by first averaging predicted sentence-
level scores (rs and ?s), correlation with error counts
(re and ?e), average precision (AP) and pairwise ac-
curacy. AP is a measure used in information retrieval
to evaluate systems that return a ranked list of doc-
uments. Herein, sentences are ranked by their pre-
dicted scores, precision is calculated at each correct
sentence (that is, containing no errors), and aver-
aged over all correct sentences (in other words, we
treat sentences with no errors as the ?relevant doc-
uments?). Pairwise accuracy is calculated based on
the number of times the corrected sentence (avail-
able through the error annotation in the FCE dataset)
is ranked higher than the original one written by the
candidate, ignoring sentences without errors. Corre-
lation with error counts, average precision and pair-
wise accuracy are particularly important as they re-
flect more directly the extent to which good and bad
sentences are discriminated. Again, in both cases,
we employ a linear ranking perceptron.
We conducted a series of experiments on a sep-
arate development set to evaluate the performance
of features beyond the ones used in the script-level
model. The final results, reported in Table 1, are
calculated on the FCE test set (Yannakoudakis et al,
2011).
Our best configuration is model b, which achieves
the highest results according to most evaluation
measures with a feature space consisting of 1) er-
ror counts identified through the absence of word
trigrams in a large background corpus, 2) phrase-
structure rules, 3) presence of frequent errors, as
well as the number of words defining an error, as
described in Section 2.3, 4) the presence of main
verbs, nouns, adjectives, subordinating conjuctions
and adverbs, 5) affixes and 6) the presence of clausal
subjects and modifiers. The texts were parsed using
RASP (Briscoe et al, 2006).
Model a, the script-level model, does not work as
well at the sentence level. However, it does perform
better when evaluated against script-level scores (rs
and ?s), and this is expected given that it is trained
directly on gold script-level scores. On the other
hand, this evaluation measure is not as indicative of
good performance in our application as the others,
as it does not take into account the varying quality
of individual sentences within a script.
Training the script-level model with different fea-
ture sets (including those utilised in the sentence-
level model) did not yield an improvement in per-
formance (the results are omitted due to space re-
strictions). Additional experiments were conducted
to investigate the effect of training the sentence-level
model with different pseudo-gold labels (e.g., addi-
tive/subtractive pseudo-gold scores rather than divi-
sive/multiplicative), but the results are not reported
here as the difference in performance was not sub-
stantial.
Table 1 shows that better performance can be
achieved with our pseudo-gold labels, used to train
a model at the sentence level, rather than gold la-

bels at the script level. To evaluate this further,
we trained a sentence-level model using the script-
level scores as labels (that is, sentences within the
same script are all assigned the same label/score).
However, this did not improve performance (again,
the results are omitted due to space restrictions).
We also point out that the best-performing feature
space (described above) is based on text properties
that are more likely to be present in relatively short
sentences (e.g., the presence of main verbs), com-
pared to those used for script-level models in previ-
ous work (Yannakoudakis et al, 2011), such as word
and part-of-speech bigrams and trigrams, which may
be too sparse for a sentence-level model.
Analogously to what we did to present the over-
all score, we developed a sentence score feedback
view to indicate the general quality of the sentences,
as given by our best model, by highlighting each of
them with a background colour ranging from green
for a well-written sentence, via yellow and orange
for a sentence which the system thinks is accept-
able, to dark orange and red for a sentence which
may have a few problems. Figure 2 shows how the
SAT system evaluates and colour-codes a few au-
thentic student-written sentences containing errors,
as well as their corrected counterparts based on the
error-coding in the FCE test set. Overall, the system
correctly identifies correct and incorrect versions of
each sentence, attributing a higher score (greener
colour) to the corrected sentence in each pair.
2.3 Word-level feedback
Basic spelling checkers have been around since the
1970s and grammar checkers since the 1980s (Ku-
kich, 1992), but misleading ?corrections? may be be-
wildering (Galletta et al, 2005), and the systems do
not always focus on the kinds of error frequently
committed, even less so in the case of learners as
was pointed out early on by Liou (1992), who tested
commercial grammar checkers on and developed a
system for detecting common errors in Taiwanese
learners? writing.
For word-level feedback within the SAT system,
we have implemented a method similar to one we
have used earlier in the context of pre-annotation of
learner corpora (Andersen, 2011). To ensure high
precision and good coverage of local errors typi-
cally committed by learners, error rules are gen-
erated from the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC)
(Nicholls, 2003) to detect word unigrams, bigrams
and trigrams which have been annotated as incorrect
at least five times and at least ninety per cent of the
times they occur. This way, rules can be extracted
from the existing error annotation in the corpus,
obviating the need for manually constructed mal-
rules, although the rules obtained by the two differ-
ent methods may to some extent be complementary.
In addition to corpus-derived rules, many classes of
incorrect but plausible derivational and inflectional
morphology are detected by means of rules derived
from a machine-readable dictionary. Many mistakes
are still not detected, but precision has been found to
be more important in terms of learning effect (Na-
gata and Nakatani, 2010), and errors missed by this
module will often give lower sentence scores.
Figure 3 illustrates some types of error detected
by the system. The feedback text is generated from
a small number of templates corresponding to differ-
ent categories of error marked up in the CLC.
We are currently working on extending this part
of the system with more general rules in addition to
word n-grams, e.g., part-of-speech tags and gram-
matical relations, in order to detect more errors with-
out loss in precision.
3 Trials
After the SAT system had been developed, a series
of trials were set up in order to test the online sys-

tem and to collect feedback from language learners
and their teachers in a variety of contexts. Three tri-
als were undertaken in November 2012, December
2012 and in March 2013, with changes made to the
system between each pair of trials.
English Profile Network member institutions
were contacted who had access to language learners
and who had previously participated in data collec-
tion for the English Profile Programme2. Teachers at
universities, secondary schools and private language
schools signed up for two or more trials so that their
learners could use and provide feedback on several
iterations of the SAT system. Certificates of partici-
2See www.englishprofile.org
pation were offered to encourage involvement in the
trials.
Ten institutions were involved from nine coun-
tries, namely Belgium, the Czech Republic, France,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and
Spain. Eight universities, one secondary school and
one private language school were represented, in-
cluding specialist and generalist institutions of ed-
ucational sciences, agricultural science, veterinary
medicine and foreign languages. Each trial had be-
tween 4 and 8 institutions taking part, and each in-
stitution participated in two or three trials with many
students undertaking more than one trial.
All students who took part in the trials, over 450
37
in total, were expected to be at or above the upper-
intermediate (CEFR B2) level as this was the level at
which the SAT system was designed to function.
Three initial sets of tasks were developed for the
planned system trials, each set consisting of three
short written prompts which asked the users to write
on a specified topic for a particular purpose, for ex-
ample:
Daily life
Your English class is going to make a
short video about daily life in your town.
Write a report for your teacher, suggest-
ing which activities should be filmed, and
why.
Tasks were based on retired questions from an in-
ternational proficiency test at B2 level of the CEFR.
Each task was given a short name which was shown
in the SAT system in order for the users to select the
most interesting or relevant task for themselves.
A short set of instructions was produced for both
teachers and students which was emailed to the main
contact in each institution and passed on to their col-
leagues, teachers and students who were interested
in taking part in the trial.
The trials operated as follows:
? The main institutional contact receives an invi-
tation to participate in the trials.
? Interested institutions receive instructions and
confirm the number of class keys required
(sign-up codes for the system).
? Main contact and teachers at each institution
log in and work through the system as if they
are a language learner, by completing a demo-
graphic questionnaire, writing 1?3 tasks which
are assessed by the system, and finally complet-
ing a short user satisfaction questionnaire.
? Students work through the SAT system either
with the support of their teacher in class or re-
motely.
3.1 SAT system usage
During Trial 1, on the busiest day there were 155
submissions and the highest number of users on
a single day was 32. These figures indicate that

all users were submitting their work for assessment
more than once, which suggests that the system is
being used in an iterative fashion as envisaged. Dur-
ing Trial 2, the busiest day saw more than twice as
many submissions as during the first trial (442), and
the most people online on any one day almost dou-
bled to 62. Across both trials we collected around
3000 submissions in total, including revisions; the
average number of revisions for a submitted piece
of writing is 3.2 with the highest figure being 54
revisions (see Table 2 for details). This suggests
that some users write their first response, then make
changes to one word or phrase at a time, resulting in
such a large number of revisions. When more than
one revision has been submitted, the score given by
the system to the last revision is higher than that
given to the initial revision in over 80% of the cases.
Current changes to the system allowing system ad-
ministrators to check on intermediate versions of
submitted texts are underway.
3.2 Feedback
In addition to looking at the writing submitted by
users of the system, there was both numerical and
written feedback available to the system developers.
This was used to suggest changes to the system at
subsequent trials.
As can be seen from Table 3, user satisfaction
scores were generally high and increased from Trial
1 to Trial 2. In the first pilot, the written feed-
back from instructors was generally positive whilst

the learner feedback was mixed, especially when it
comes to sentence evaluation:
In summary, I liked this system, because
the sentence colouring suggests me to
think about my writing style, mistakes,
what I should improve, change. This sys-
tem is not like a teacher, who checks all
our errors, but makes us develop our crit-
ical thinking, which is the most important
for writing especially. [...]
It?s okay the way of colouring system, the
problem is that it doesn?t tell you specifi-
cally what?s wrong with constructions so
you have think what you failed.
The fact that the system provides almost immediate
feedback has been appreciated:
I like that the paragraphs which I wrote
assesed so quickly. . . . Secondly, I really
like that student can correct his text till it
gets ideal.
Users have also made suggestions for improve-
ments, which have been essential for deciding which
parts of the system should be developed further.
3.3 System changes
As a result of feedback and the team?s extensive use
of the system, after each trial changes were made
both to the on-screen experience and behind the
scenes. After Trial 1, the system was amended to
enable users to see paragraph breaks in the corrected
version (which before had not been shown in the as-
sessed view of the text). There was also a new error
view with permanently visible explanations and ex-
amples and an additional question on the feedback
questionnaire which asked whether users felt the

system had improved since the previous time they
used it. Behind the scenes, the server was upgraded
to cope with anticipated demand and code was writ-
ten so that administrators could review statistics on
usage.
At the time of writing the third SAT system trial
was underway. In the first two trials the total number
of words collected was over 600,000 with an average
response length of around 1100 characters or 200
words. Encouragingly, there were many longer re-
sponses including twelve over 1080 words in length
and the longest written to date is 1773 words. These
figures indicate that the system is not restrictive, but
encourages and inspires students to write. Table 4
gives an overview of the script length distribution.
Following two successful trials, the third trial
aimed to involve new and existing users and to pro-
vide more detailed teacher feedback.
4 Conclusions
In this paper, we described a tool that provides feed-
back to learners of English at three different levels
of granularity: an overall assessment of their profi-
ciency, assessment of individual sentences, and di-
agnostic feedback on local issues including spelling
and word choice. We argued that the use of visual-
39
isation techniques is important, as they allow us to
go beyond the mere display of a number, can stimu-
late the learners? visual perceptions, and can display
information in an intuitive and easily interpretable
way. The usefulness and usability of the tool as a
whole, as well as of its components, was confirmed
through questionnaire-based evaluations, where, for
example, the perceived usefulness of the sentence
colouring received an average of 4.15 on a 5-point
scale.
The first component of the SAT system, script-
level assessment, uses a machine learner to predict
a score for a text and roughly estimate someone?s
proficiency level based on lexical and grammatical
features. The second component allows for an auto-
matic evaluation of the linguistic quality of individ-
ual sentences. We proposed a method for generat-
ing sentence-level scores, which we use for training
our model. Using this method, we were able to learn
what features can be used to evaluate linguistic qual-
ity of (relatively short) sentences. Indicating prob-
lematic regions via highlighting of sentences may be
better from a pedagogic point of view than detecting
and correcting all errors identified in the text. The
third component automatically provides diagnostic
feedback on local errors with high precision on the
basis of a few templates, without relying on manu-
ally crafted rules.
The trials undertaken so far have improved the
functionality of the system in regard to what is on
offer to teachers and their students, but they have
also provided the basis for further research and de-
velopment to enhance the system?s functionality and
design and move towards wider deployment. We
plan to continue improving the methodologies used
for providing feedback to learners, as well as adding
further functionality, such as L1-specific feedback.
Another logical next step would be to continue to-
wards lower levels of granularity, moving from the
sentence as the unit of assessment to clauses and
phrases, which may be particularly beneficial for
more advanced language users who write longer and
more complex sentences.
