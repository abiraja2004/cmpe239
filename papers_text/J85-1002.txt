Upon the completion of its highly successful TAUM-METEO machine translation system, the TAUM 
group undertook the construction of TAUM-AVIATION, an experimental system for English to French 
translation in the sublanguage of technical maintenance manuals. A detailed description of the resulting 
prototype is offered. In particular, the paper includes: a) some figures on the size of the system; b) a 
description of the underlying translation model (indirect approach, analysis/transfer/synthesis scheme); 
c) a presentation of the basic computational techniques (use of a specialized high-level metalanguage 
for each linguistic component); and d) some results on the evaluation of the prototype. 
1 BACKGROUND 
1.1 HISTORICAL NOTES 
In 1965, with funding from the National Research Coun- 
cil of Canada, the CETADOL research center in computa- 
tional linguistics was created at l'Universit6 de Montr6al. 
Around 1970, the center narrowed its focus to the prob- 
lem of machine translation (MT), renaming itself TAUM 
(Traduction Automatique Universit6 de Montr6al). In the 
next few years, several MT protypes were developed: 
TAUM-71, TAUM-73, and TAUM-76 (Colmerauer et al 
1971, Kittredge et al 1973, Kittredge et al 1976). 
Starting in 1973, the Canadian Secretary of State 
Department (Translation Bureau) assumed responsibility 
for funding the project, in the hope that tangible results 
would soon emerge. Between 1974 and 1976, TAUM 
produced its first practical application: the 
TAUM-METEO system, for the translation of weather 
forecasts (Chevalier et al 1978). Since 1977, this system 
has been used on a daily basis for the Canadian Environ- 
ment Department (Chandioux and Gu6raud 1981). Its 
current workload represents an annual volume of 8.5 
million words (Bourbeau 1984). In spite of its very 
narrow scope, TAUM-METEO represents an important 
breakthrough in MT, since it is the only system that 
currently produces high quality translation without the 
need for human revision (although approximately 20% 
of the input is rejected). 
The AVIATION project was undertaken in 1976, even 
before the on-site implementation of TAUM-METEO was 
completed. The aim was to develop a system capable of 
translating aircraft maintenance manuals. Obviously, this 
was a more difficult challenge than translating weather 
forecasts. The magnitude of the task necessitated a
massive infusion of new personnel and the development 
of a set of new metalanguages (e.g. LEXTRA, SISIF). A 
prototype of the TAUM-AVIATION system, restricted to 
hydraulic system maintenance manuals, was demon- 
strated in 1979. 
The following year, an independent evaluation 
(Gervais 1980) concluded that it was not possible to 
envisage immediate cost-effective production using 
TAUM-AVIATION. This evaluation led the Translation 
Bureau to stop funding the TAUM-AVIATION project, 
and to look for a broader funding base for MT research 
and development in Canada. In the meantime, the TAUM 
Group had to be disbanded. 
1.2 LANGUAGES TRANSLATED 
TAUM-AVIATION is designed in such a way that a core 
portion of the system is independent of particular 
language pairs: linguistic descriptions constitute data for

the system. However, from a linguistic perspective, the 
project was exclusively focused on English-to-French 
translation. 
In addition, the linguistic descriptions incorporated 
into the system are addressed not to general language but 
to the particular sublanguage of maintenance manuals 
(Lehrberger 1982). The notion of sublanguage is 
presented in Kittredge and Lehrberger (1982). 
1.3 PROJECT SIZE 
The initial staff of seven researchers in 1976 was rapidly 
increased to a peak of 20 people during 1979, and then 
slowly decreased until the project was terminated. 
1.4 SYSTEM SIZE 
TAUM-AVIATION was implemented on a CYBER 173 
computer, with the NOS/BE 1.4 operating system, but 
was designed so as to be practically machine-indepen- 
dent. Most components of the system are based on the 
following scheme: certain linguistic data (dictionaries, 
grammars) are compiled into an object code interpreted 
at run time against he input text. Table 1 gives an idea 
of the size of the runtime code, together with typical 
memory requirements for execution. Table 2 gives the 
size of the programs used to compile the linguistic data. 
1.5 SIZE OF DICTIONARIES 
The dictionaries list only the base form of the words 
(roughly speaking, the entry form in a conventional 
dictionary). In March 1981, the source language 
(English) dictionary included 4054 entries; these entries 
represented the core vocabulary of maintenance manuals, 
plus a portion of the speciafized vocabulary of hydraulics. 
Of these, 3280 had a corresponding entry in the bilingual 
English-French dictionary. 
2 APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT 
TAUM-AVIATION remains an experimental system. It is 
designed to take as input a text that is in a photocompo- 
sition-ready format; a pre-processing program stores the 
formatting codes, which will be reinserted in the trans- 
lated text. No use is made of manual pre-editing. 
The translation process is fully automatic. If desired, it 
can be interrupted after dictionary lookup to obtain a list 
of unidentified words, and enter any such words in the 
dictionary. 
Revision of the machine output is normally necessary: 
the domain is too complex for results comparable to 
those of TAUM-METEO. The designers of the system 
decided not to rely heavily on "fail-soft" strategies uch 
as constraint relaxation or partial parses; these strategies 
make the quality of the output totally unpredictable. 
Thus, the material passing through the system is trans- 
lated relatively well (very well by MT standards), and the 
revisor is less likely to feel overwhelmed by finguistic 
garbage. The price to be paid is a failure to produce any 
output for a relatively high proportion of the input 
sentences (somewhere between 20 and 40 per cent, at 
the stage of development reached in 1981). For a sample 
of translations produced by TAUM-AVIATION, see the 
Appendix. 
The development of TAUM-AVIATION has not been 
taken far enough for a definitive assessment to be made 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Number 1, January-March 1985 19 
Pierre Isabelle and Laurent Bourbeau TAUM-AVIATION: Its Technical Features and Some Experimental Results 
of the linguistic and computational strategies that it 
embodied: the total system throughput was approximate- 
ly 100,000 words. 
3 GENERAL TRANSLATION APPROACH 
The TAUM-AVIATION system is based on a typical 
second generation design (Isabelle et al 1978, Bourbeau 
1981). The translation is produced indirectly, by means 
of an analysis/transfer/synthesis scheme. The internal 
organization of the major components of the system is 
based on the :notion of linguistic level. Finally, the 
linguistic data are generally separated from the algorith- 
mic specifications. 
3.1 TRANSFER MODEL 
The overall design of the system is based on the assump- 
tion that translation rules should not be applied directly 
to the input string, but rather to a formal object that 
represents a structural description of the content of this 
input. Thus, the source language (SL) text (or successive 
fragments of it) is mapped onto the representations of an 
in termediate language, (also called normalized structure) 
prior to the application of any target language-dependent 
rule. 
No one knows how to construct a universal, 
language-independent semantic interlingua. The inter- 
mediate language used in the TAUM-AVIATION system is 
largely language dependent: it consists of semantically 
annotated eep structures for SL and TL sentences. A
certain degree of language independence is attained by 
the use of a common "base component" (a context-free 
grammar that enumerates the admissible deep structures) 
for both SL and TL. But the lexical items are left intact, 
and a transfer module is used in order to map the lexical 
items of SL onto those of TL. 
3.2 LINGUISTIC ORGANIZATION 
The arrangement of the system into three major modules 
(analysis, transfer, synthesis) reflects a theoretical model 
of translation operations: it is claimed that these oper- 
ations take place at a "deep" level, between language-de- 
pendent meaning representations. Moreover, each one of 
the three modules is arranged internally along the lines of 
a linguistic theory: the components of these modules 
correspond to the standard levels of linguistic description 
(lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics). This contrasts 
with older systems, the structure of which frequently had 
no direct relationship to any definite theory of language 
and translation.

4 LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES 
4.1 PROCESSING UNITS 
It is well known that some translation problems can only 
be solved trough textual, as opposed to sentential, proc- 
essing. However, we still know too little about discourse 
analysis techniques to use them effectively in large-scale 
systems. Thus, the processing unit in TAUM-AVIATION 
is the sentence. 
Fortunately, anaphoric pronouns are quite rare in 
technical manuals. A more frequent problem is the use of 
anaphoric definite noun phrases. Consider for example 
the text fragment in (1): 
(1) Remove hydraulic filter bypass valve. This valve is 
located below accumulator No. 1. 
A word like valve cannot be translated correctly in 
isolation. Depending on the type of valve, French will 
use clapet, robinet, soupape, etc. In the second sentence of 
(1), the word valve is used anaphorically. To translate it 
correctly, one has to refer to its antecedent: he modifier 
bypass determines a specific French equivalent. 
TAUM-AVIATION cannot solve problems of this type. 
The designers of the system preferred to concentrate 
their efforts on the best possible sentential analysis. And 
in fact, in spite of a relatively advanced sentence analyz- 
er, translation failures due to weaknesses in sentential 
processing (e.g. scoping problems for conjunctions, 
nominal compounds, etc.) turned out to be much more 
frequent than failures due to anaphor problems, as 
evidenced by the error compilations of Lehrberger (1981). 
4.2 THE ANALYSIS MODULE: AMBIGUITY PROBLEMS 
Ambiguity is a language-internal phenomenon and it is 
the responsibility of the analysis module to resolve it. 
Sometimes, it is possible to ignore certain ambiguities, in 
the hope that the same ambiguities will carry over in 
translation. This is particularly 'true in systems like 
TAUM-AVIATION that deal with only one pair of closely 
related languages. The difficult problem of prepositional 
phrase attachment, for example, is frequently bypassed in 
this way. Generally speaking, however, analysis is aimed 
at producing an unambiguous intermediate represen- 
tation. 
The analysis module comprises four components: pre- 
processing, morphology, lexicon and syntactic/semantic 
analysis (see Figure 1). The pre-processing component 
segments the input text into successive words and into 
processing units. In this latter function, it can be seen as 
a degenerate text grammar. Because this is carried out 
deterministically, without interaction from the other 
components, egmentation problems occasionally arise. 
Morphological analysis includes complete rules and 
exception lists for English inflectional morphology, cate- 
gory assignment rules for numbers and rules for dealing 
with unknown words. No rules are provided for deriva- 
tional morphology. The system handles some types of 
compositional morphology, but this is done in the syntac- 
tic component, since compounds frequently exhibit prop- 
erties that are otherwise thought of as syntactic; for 
example, internal conjunction is possible (e.g. four- and 
six-cell batteries). 
Syntactic and semantic analysis are very tightly inte- 
grated in the TAUM-AVIATION system. First, both of 
them are implemented using the same metalanguage, a 
particular version of Wood's ATNs (see section 5, 
below). Second, both components interact freely during 
analysis. It is nevertheless convenient to describe them 
separately. 
4.2.1 SYNTAX 
The TAUM-AVIATION system includes a large-scale 
grammar of English capable of handling most 
constructions that occur with some frequency in the 
sublanguage of maintenance manuals (Lehrberger 1982). 
The rules are based on an extensive lexical subcategon- 
zation scheme: 12 standard categories are further 
subclassified using more than 75 features (excluding 
morpho-syntactic features). This is in addition to the use 
of lexical "strict subcategonzation" frames comparable 
to those of transformational grammar. 
Since the intermediate r presentation used for transfer 
is a type of semantically annotated "deep structure", and 
since maintenance manuals make use of a very complex 
syntax, it was necessary to provide the parser with a rich 
transformational component. Thus, the inverses of 
several transformations from standard transformational 
theory are used: passive, extraposition, raising, etc. 
In dealing with texts as complex as technical manuals, 
the parser is faced with difficult ambiguity problems. 
Ambiguities are already present in the input to the 
parser, at the lexical level. These ambiguities may 
concern the syntactic properties of the lexical element 
(e.g. light is a noun, a verb, or an adjective); or they may 
concern primarily its semantic properties: pure homo- 
graphs like the two nouns lead or polysemous items like 
the noun line. 
The parser will as a side effect eliminate some lexical 
ambiguities; for example, if Check valve is to be taken as 
a sentence, syntax tells us that check must be a verb. 
However, the parser will itself introduce structural ambi- 
guities, owing to the existence of syntactically undeter- 
mined choice points in the application of grammar ules. 
Two examples of structural ambiguity are adjective scope 
as in (3), and conjunction scope, as in (4).

Pierre lsabelle and Laurent Bourbeau TAUM-AVIATION: Its Technical Features and Some Experimental Results 
These examples show that with ADJ NOUN NOUN 
sequences and NOUN CONJ NOUN NOUN sequences, 
two different syntactic groupings are possible. But only 
one of them is semantically acceptable and results in a 
correct ranslation. 
Moreover, some lexical ambiguities, instead of being 
eliminated in the parsing process, will constitute a further 
source of structural ambiguity, each reading of the rele- 
vant lexical item being compatible with a different 
syntactic structure. In example (5), drain can be taken 
either as a noun or as a verb, when appropriate adjust- 
ments are made to the surrounding syntactic structure. 
(5) Remove dust cap and drain plug. 
Thus by itself, a syntactic parser produces a highly 
ambiguous output, and further constraints are needed in 
a practical MT system. 
4.2.2 SEMANTICS 
Semantic processing in the TAUM-AVIATION system 
performs two related tasks: a) it filters the syntactic 
structures, eliminating as many ambiguities as possible; 
and b) it associates with each node of the tree a set of 
semantic features which will be used by transfer ules. 
Most semantic features originate in the dictionary, 
where lexical items are described in terms of some 35 
features that form a tangled hierarchy. Predicative lexical 
items (verbs, adjectives, certain prepositions) are 
assigned selectional restrictions on their possible argu- 
ments in terms of these semantic features. 
Selectional restrictions constitute the main semantic 
mechanism used by the system to eliminate ambiguities 
of two types: 
a. structural ambiguities introduced by syntactic rules; 
thus the spurious structure proposed by the parser 
for (5) is eliminated because the verb drain does not 
accept as direct object something in the semantic 
category of plug, 
b. lexical ambiguity in the semantic properties of certain 
lexical items; polysemous words like the noun line 
(which can denote either an abstract geometrical 
object, or physical objects such as conductors) are 
frequently disambiguated by selectional restrictions; 
for example, in Flush the line, the concrete sense is 
selected. 
In order for selectional restrictions to work properly 
and for trees to be correctly annotated, it is necessary to 
apply semantic projection rules which assign sets of 
features to tree nodes. In TAUM-AVIATION, the seman- 
tic rules work in a compositional fashion, raising selec- 
tively certain features from daughter nodes to their 
mothers (Isabelle 1985). Rules such as the following are 
used: 
? all of the semantic features of a headnoun are raised 
onto the dominating NP node; 
? the intersection of the features of two conjoined NP 
nodes is raised onto the dominating NP node; and 
? when the headnoun is a partitive noun (e.g. portion), 
and the NP has an of NP complement, he features of 
this complement are raised onto the dominating NP 
node. 
The system also makes use of standard control rules 
for subjectless infinitives and gerundives, and of some 
pronoun/antecedent rules, in order to enforce semantic 
constraints wherever possible. 
Semantic ambiguity, whether real homography (e.g. 
the two nouns lead) or polysemy (e.g. the various senses 
of the noun line), is not handled by creating multiple 
entries in the source language dictionary. Rather, in its 
single entry, the word is assigned a number of seman- 
tically incompatible features. The semantic rules seek to 
filter out some of these features, so that no incompatibili- 
ty remains. This strategy prevents the redundant syntac- 
tic search that results from a multiple-entry strategy. 
4.3 THE TRANSFER MODULE 
In principle, transfer ules state correspondences between 
two sets of unambiguous tructural descriptions. Their 
most obvious task is to relate the lexical items of SL to 
those of TL. Even if the rules are applied to unambig- 
uous lexical elements, the correspondences are by no 
means one-to-one: the lexical system of each natural 
language reflects a specific way of breaking down the 
conceptual universe. For this reason, equivalences have 
to be stated in terms of structural patterns rather than in 
terms of words or strings of words. 
To take an example, there is no language-internal 
evidence that hard is ambiguous in English; however, 
depending on the context, it is translated into French as 
difficile, dur, etc. The French equivalents have more 
restricted collocations. In all those cases, transfer rules 
are needed to select the contextually appropriate quiv- 
alent. 
Moreover, very frequently, these lexical transfer ules 
cannot simply substitute lexical items, leaving the tree 
structure unaffected. Since SL and TL lexical items 
frequently have different contextual requirements (i.e. 
subcategorization frames), translation rules have to 
establish correspondences between a source and a target 
structural pattern, as illustrated by the examples in (6). 
(6) a. check x against y ~ comparer x ~ y 
b. supply x with y ~ fournir y ~ x 
c. cantilever x ~ monter x en porte-~t-faux 
d. bond x electrostatically ~ m6talliser x
e. service x ~ faire l'entretien de x 
It is clear that lexical transfer ules must include powerful 
transformational mechanisms. This basic fact has not so 
far received the attention it deserves in the MT communi- 
ty. The TAUM-AVIATION system provides for full trans- 
formational power at the level of lexical transfer 
(Chevalier et al 1981). 
The transfer component also involves rules for struc- 
tural transfer, that is, rules that deal with linguistic 
22 Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Number 1, January-March 1985 
Pierre Isabelle and Laurent Bourbeau TAUM-AVIATION: Its Technical Features and Some Experimental Results 
contrasts not tied to any specific lexical item. Since the 
same base rules are used for SL and TL, this sub-compo- 
nent is kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, a number of 
structural differences between SL and TL have to be 
accounted for by means of contrastive rules. For exam- 
ple, because the intermediate language does not provide 
for "universal semantic tenses", the tense systems of SL 
and TL have to be explicitly contrasted by a set of rules. 
Another task left .to structural transfer is to deal with 
observable contrasts concerning the use of optional  move-  
ment  transformations.  In all likelihood, the use of these 
transformations is governed by discourse phenomena that 
the system does not attempt to analyze. The strategy 
used in TAUM-AVIATION is to take advantage of the 
frequent parallelisms between SL and TL regarding these 
aspects of surface structure organization. Thus, the inter- 
mediate representation retains "traces" from SL surface 
structure used by the synthesis component to maintain a 
certain parallelism with SL. However, in some cases we 
know that the two languages exhibit systematic differ- 
ences in their use of certain movement transformations. 
The structural transfer grammar describes these facts. 
For instance, TAUM-AVIATION includes complex rules 
for translating English passives with various French 
constructions, as illustrated in the following examples: 
(7) Quick-disconnect fi tings should not be removed. 
--,. Ne pas enleverAes raccords fi d6montage rapide. 
(8) Ensure that pump and lines are bled. 
--,. S'assurer qu'on a purg6 la pompe et les canalisa- 
tions. 
(9) The flaps are operated by hydraulic system no. 1. 
Le circuit hydraulique no. 1 actionne les volets. 
4.4 THE SYNTHESIS MODULE 
Synthesis of the TL text involves three steps: syntactic 
synthesis, morphological synthesis, and post-processing. 
Syntactic synthesis is carried out on the basis of a 
large-scale transformational grammar of French. Since 
the input to the synthesis component is normally a well- 
formed unambiguous sentential deep structure, synthesis 
here is much simpler than analysis. This is not to say that 
synthesis of natural language texts is generally easy. 
Generating a coherent text from an abstract discourse 
representation is certainly a very difficult problem. But in 
TAUM-AVIATION, synthesis can only be achieved on a 
sentential basis. Therefore, no attempt can be made to 
describe the complex discourse factors that influence 
sentence generation (e.g. application of "optional" move- 
ment transformations). As mentioned in the previous 
section, the strategy adopted is to try to preserve a 
certain parallelism with the SL sentences, since both 
languages have relatively similar means of expressing 
discourse cohesion. 
Syntactic synthesis produces a string of lexical items 
annotated with all the information required to inflect 
them correctly. The morphological synthesis component 
then determines the final form of each word. This is done 
on the basis of an exhaustive description of the rules of 
French inflection (together with their exceptions). Post- 
processing reformats the TL text, making use, wherever 
possible, of the formatting codes of the SL text. 
5 COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES 
From the computational point of view, the 
TAUM-AVIATION system is more complex than 
TAUM-METEO, which is entirely written in the Q-SYS- 
TEMS metalanguage (Colmerauer 1971). One of the 
ideas underlying TAUM-AVIATION is to make use of 
specialized tools for different tasks in the interests of 
increased efficiency, though somewhat at the expense of 
overall simplicity. 
In the implementation, the actual modules closely 
match the components of the linguistic model presented 
in Figure 1. They are applied sequentially and communi- 
cation between components is achieved by means of a 
chart structure (a type of loop-free graph). The arcs of 
these charts are labelled with tree structures whose nodes 
are labelled with complex symbols: a categorial label plus 
a set of features. 
Most components are based on the following scheme. 
Certain linguistic data are described with a high-level 
metalanguage; in this metalanguage, the linguist 
expresses facts about tree structures. These descriptions 
are compiled into an abstract formal structure interpreted 
at run time against he material to be translated. Most of 
these compilers and interpreters are written in PASCAL. 
5.1 PRE- AND POST-PROCESSING 
These relatively simple components, which map character 
strings onto sequences of chart structures and vice-versa, 
are implemented as sets of rules in a metalanguage called 
SISIF; a set of SISIF rules amounts to a deterministic 
finite-state automaton. These rules are compiled into list 
structures, which are interpreted against he input text at 
run time. 
5.2 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY 
Since it was possible to exhaustively describe the inflec- 
tional morphology of both French and English, there was 
no compelling reason to use a very high-level formalism. 
Consequently, in the interests of efficiency, two PASCAL 
programs were written for morphological analysis of 
English and morphological synthesis of French. 
5.3 DICTIONARIES 
5.3.1 SOURCE LANGUAGE DICTIONARY 
A dictionary system called SYDICAN enables the linguist 
to write lexical rules that associate a complex of lexical 
information with a string of base forms, forming a path in 
an input chart. Two types of rules are provided: a) rules 
that simply add a new path (labelled with the complex of 
lexical information) to the chart; and b) rules that, in 
Computational Linguistics, Volume 11, Number 1, January-March 1985 23 
Pierre Isabelle and Laurent Bourbeau TAUM-AVIATION: Its Technical Features and Some Experimental Results 
addition, have the effect of taking precedence over short- 
er matches in the chart (cf. "longest-match" strategy). 
The rules are compiled into list structures. At run time, 
they are retrieved from an arbitrarily large lexical data 
base and applied to the chart. The lexical database 
system includes some maintenance facilities, such as 
integrity constraints on its contents, and facilities for 
retrieving entries through arbitrarily complex requests on 
their contents. 
5.3.2 BILINGUAL DICTIONARY 
We saw in 4.3 that lexical transfer involves rules that 
perform complex transformations on tree structures. The 
LEXTRA metalanguage makes it possible to associate 
with any lexical item an arbitrarily complex set of tree 
transformations. These transformations describe a 
pattern (anchored in the relevant lexical item), which is 
to be matched against the tree structure at run time. 
When a match is found, a series of associated actions 
specifying structural changes is performed. 
An important idea embodied in LEXTRA is that a 
transfer component should have an explicit description of 
the intermediate language. In the TAUM approach this 
intermediate language is partially defined by a set of 
context-free rules that describe a common base compo- 
nent for SL and TL. LEXTRA takes as data this context- 
free grammar and guarantees that any manipulated tree 
structure corresponds to a permissible derivation in terms 
of that context-free grammar. This notion is to be related 
to computational formulations of transformational gram- 
mar such as Petrick (1973), where the deep structures 
produced by the inverse transformations are checked 
against the rules of the base component. No equivalent 
check is performed with parsing systems like ATNs. 
LEXTRA rules are compiled into list structures. It was 
found that some of the constraints on admissible tree 
structures could be enforced at compile time 
(G6dn-Lajoie 1980). This mechanism is very useful in 
the complex task of dictionary development. It helps vali- 
date the work of the lexicographer. At run time, the 
LEXTRA interpreter searches the tree structure for SL 
lexical items, retrieves the associated lexical rules and 
applies them to the tree.

The English grammar for syntactic analysis is written in 
REZO (Stewart 1975, 1978), TAUM's version of 
augmented transition etworks (ATNs). The REZO meta- 
language is different from Wood's ATNs (Woods 1970) 
in several respects. Some of the differences are: 
? REZO does not support morphological nalysis, which is 
performed in a separate component; 
? tree nodes are complex symbols that include sets of 
features on which boolean operations can be 
performed; 
? REZO includes a number of primitives to perform 
pattern matching over tree structures; 
? in addition to regular ATN states where all transitions 
are tried, REZO includes "deterministic" states where 
only the first transition whose test is met is followed; 
? REZO accords special status to the states to which a 
recursive call can be made, so that the resulting gram- 
mar is a collection of sub-networks. 
The REZO grammar is compiled into a set of 
instructions for a virtual machine, which is simulated by 
the runtime interpreter. Parsing is done in the usual top- 
down, depth-first, left-to-right, serial manner. The inter- 
preter can either work in an all-paths or in a first-path 
mode. One important difference from Wood's ATN inter- 
preter is that REZO takes as input a chart structure in 
which lexical ambiguities are encoded and applies the 
grammar in parallel to all the paths of this chart. The 
result is also a chart structure: REZO is thus a chart-to- 
chart transducer. 
In 4.2, it was mentioned that syntactic rules create 
structural ambiguities, and that semantic processing can 
eliminate some of these. Serial parsing provides another 
means of selecting a particular eading. Since the transi- 
tions of the REZO networks are followed in a fixed order, 
the grammar can be made to produce the most likely 
reading first. In TAUM-AVIATION's analysis grammar, 
the ordering of the transitions reflects: 
? general parsing principles such as those discussed in 
human performance studies (e.g. Kimball 1973); and 
? sublanguage-specific statistical tendencies. 
5.4.2 STRUCTURAL TRANSFER AND SYNTHESIS 
Structural transfer and syntactic synthesis are imple- 
mented in the well-known Q-SYSTEMS, which we will 
not describe here. This introduces some heterogeneity 
into TAUM-AVIATION, since: a) unlike the other meta- 
languages, Q-SYSTEMS do not support trees with 
complex symbols as node labels; and b) the compiler and 
the interpreter are written in FORTRAN while PASCAL is 
used for the other metalanguages. 
In fact, the original design of the system included 
provisions for a new metalanguage well suited to synthe- 
sis; but time constraints precluded its development. 
6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
6.1 COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION 
In 1981, the sponsor submitted TAUM-AVIATION to a 
cost-benefit evaluation, in order to determine if the 
system was usable in a production environment. This 
evaluation made by an independent consultant is 
reported in Gervais (1980), and we will only summarize 
the main conclusions. 
Raw machine output was deemed to have a degree of 
intelligibility, fidelity, and style that reaches 80% of 
unrevised human translations (HT).

Revised MT and revised HT have a comparable degree 
of quality, but revision costs are twice as high for MT; 
thus, globally, revised MT turns out to be more expensive 
than revised HT as shown in Table 3. However, it is 
noted in the evaluator's report that MT reduces by half 
the human time required in the translation/revision proc- 
ess. 
The direct costs of MT could probably be reduced to 
an acceptable level, for example by interfacing the 
system with a suitable word-processing environment and 
by reducing the percentage of sentences for which no 
translation is produced (Isabelle 1981). 
Cost-effective production would require the system to 
be applicable to at least 6 million words per year. In 
order to reach that target, the system would have to be 
extended to translate domains other than hydraulics. But 
the indirect costs involved in these extensions (e.g. 
dictionary development) are very high. Gervais concludes 
that it is impossible to assert that translation using 
TAUM-AVIATION would be globally cheaper than 
human translation. 
6.2 TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE 
Cost-benefit evaluations are certainly necessary, but a 
single evaluation of this type tells one very little about 
how the system can be expected to perform on different 
texts, or after further investment. TAUM developed a 
methodology for analyzing the performance of an MT 
system through a systematic examination of its trans- 
lation errors. 
The first step is to collect all the errors in the trans- 
lation of the sample text; translators/revisors then have 
the responsibility of deciding what is to be counted as an 
error. A classification scheme for translation errors will 
include headings such as the following: incorrect TL 
equivalent for a word, incorrect word order, lack of an 
article, etc. 
In itself, an absolute number of such errors for a given 
text is not very revealing; but a comparison of the ratio 
of errors to word tokens in different exts, or at various 
stages of development of the system is an initial source of 
useful information. 
Still, from the point of view of system development, 
these "surface" translation problems are merely symp- 
toms for problems in some component of the system. To 
provide an answer to questions uch as: 
? how many of these problems have a known solution? 
? how long would it take to correct hem? 
? how much better would the performance of the system 
be after n person/months of work? 
? what should the priorities be? 
it is necessary to identify, for each surface problem, one 
or several causes in the functioning of the system. For 
example, the fact that; in the translation of a given 
sentence, a French adjective is incorrectly inflected could 
be caused by one or more of the following factors: 
? incorrect marking in a dictionary entry; 
? mistake in TL syntactic rules for agreement; 
? incorrect scoping in SL analysis (e.g. give the wrong 
bracketing to an ADJ NOUN NOUN sequence); or 
? absence of relevant marking in SL (e.g. when translating 
federal and provincial governments into French, should 
one pluralize the adjectives?). 
A sophisticated error classification grid was developed, 
so that the sources of translation errors could be investi- 
gated in a coherent and meaningful way. Basically, this 
error grid reflects the internal organization of the system, 
so that translation errors can be assigned a precise cause 
in the operation of the system. 
Once a coherent scheme is available, one can proceed 
with the classification of the translation errors found in 
the sample text. This classification process is difficult and 
tedious, but it is crucial that it be done with accuracy and 
consistency. Frequently, one has to follow "execution 
traces" to discover the exact source of a given error. 
The final step is to look at the possible remedies for 
the problems that have been identified. A careful exam- 
ination of each problem source will reveal whether or not 
there is a known way of eliminating it, and if so, what 
amount of effort is needed. 
If this type of technical evaluation can be carried out 
at successive stages of development (with both old and 
new texts), one gets a clear picture of the evolution of 
the system. The figures obtained will reveal whether or 
not: 
? there has been substantial progress compared to previ- 
ous stages; 
? an asymptote has been reached in the curve 
investment/improvement. 
The same figures will also help determine development 
and research priorities. 
This sort of technical evaluation was applied twice to 
TAUM-AVIATION in the final year of the project; only a 
few person-months of development had been invested in

the system between the two tests. The main goal was to 
see how well a system developed on the basis of corpora 
from the domain of hydraulics would fare in the domain 
of electronics. Some results were as follows: 
? In both tests, more than 70% of the failures were clas- 
sified as having a known solution; the vast majority of 
these could be corrected in 12 person/months  of work. 
? From a syntactic point of view, there is no notable 
difference between hydraulics and electronics. In fact, 
as a result of a minimal effort in correcting some prob- 
lems discovered in the test on hydraulics, the overall 
performance of the parser turned out to be better in the 
electronics test. 
? As expected, there was a major dictionary problem in 
going from one domain to the other. Selectional 
restrictions as assigned for hydraulics worked so poorly 
that they did more harm than good to the final result. 
A definitive assessment of the linguistic and computa- 
tional techniques on which TAUM-AVIATION is based 
would have required a few more applications of this 
evaluat ion/correct ion cycle. 
7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
Before TAUM was disbanded, Isabelle 1981 voiced the 
views of the group on a possible course for short- and 
long-term machine translation R&D activities. 
The difficulties encountered in the AVIATION project 
convinced the Translat ion Bureau that a more permanent 
and broader R&D base would be required for MT to be 
viable in Canada. In 1983, the Translat ion Bureau in 
conjunct ion with the Canadian Department of Communi -  
cations, funded a large-scale study to review natural 
language processing technologies and examine opportu- 
nities for Canada in this field. 
The consultants have submitted their report and the 
two Departments involved now have to determine the 
best way to implement he recommendations that are 
made therein. In the area of MT, there would appear to 
be three fronts on which R&D could be pursued: 
? the development and integration of various computer 
aids to human translation within a translator's work- 
station; 
? the application of second-generation MT technology to 
promising sublanguages (Kittredge 1983); 
? research on third-generation MT technology.
