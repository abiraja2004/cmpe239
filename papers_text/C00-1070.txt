Abst rac t  
Since most previous works tbr HMM-1)ased tag- 
ging consider only part-ofsl)eech intbrmation in 
contexts, their models (:minor utilize lexical in- 
forlnatiol~ which is crucial tbr resolving some 
morphological tmfl)iguity. In this paper we in- 
troduce mliformly lexicalized HMMs fin: i)art -
ofst)eech tagging in 1)oth English and \](ore, an. 
The lexicalized models use a simplified back-off 
smoothing technique to overcome data Sl)arse- 
hess. In experiment;s, lexi(:alized models a(:hieve 
higher accuracy than non-lexicifliz(~d models 
and the l)ack-off smoothing metho(l mitigates 
data sparseness 1)etter (;ban simple smoothing 
methods.

1)arl;-Ofsl)e(:('h(POS) tagging is a l)ro(:ess ill 
which a l)rOl)('.r \])()S l;ag is assigned to ea(:h wor(l 
in raw tex(;s. Ev('n though morl)h()logi(:ally am- 
l)iguous words have more thnn one P()S tag, 
they l)elong to just one tag in a colll;ex(;. 'J~o 
resolve such ambiguity, taggers lmve to consult 
various som'ces of inibrmation such as lexica\] 
i)retbrences (e.g. without consulting context, 
table is more probably a n(mn than a. ver}) or 
an adje(:t;ive), tag n-gram context;s (e.g. after a 
non-1)ossessiv(: pronoun, table is more l)robal)ly 
a verb than a. nmm or an adjective., as in th, ey ta- 
ble an amendment), word n-grain conl;e.xl;s (e.g. 
betbre lamp, table is more probal)ly an adjective 
than ~ noun or ~ verb, as in I need a table lamp), 
and so on(Lee et al, 1.999). 
However, most previous HMM-1)ased tag- 
gers consider only POS intbrmation in con- 
texts, and so they C~I~IlII()t capture lexical infi)r- 
nmtion which is necessary for resolving some 
mort)hological alnbiguity. Some recent, works 
lmve rel)orted thai; tagging a('curacy could 
l)e iml)roved 1)y using lexicM intbrnml;ion in 
their models such as the transtbrmation-based 
patch rules(Brill, 1994), the ln~txinnun entropy 
model(lIatn~q)arkhi, 1996), the statistical ex- 
ical ruh:s(Lee et al, 1999), the IIMM consid- 
ering multi-words(Kim, 1996), the selectively 
lexicalized HMM(Kim et al, 1999), and so on. 
In the l)revious works(Kim, 1996)(Kim et al, 
1999), however, their ItMMs were lexicalized se- 
h:ctively and resl;rictively. 
\]n this l>al)er w('. prol)ose a method of uni- 
formly lcxicalizing the standard IIMM for part- 
o f  speech tagging in both English and Korean. 
Because the slmrse-da.ta problem is more seri- 
ous in lexicMized models ttl~ll ill the standard 
model, a simplified version of the well-known 
back-oil' smoothing nml;hod is used to overcome 
the. 1)rol)lem. For experiments, the Brown cor- 
pus(Francis, 1982) is used lbr English tagging 
and the KUNLP (:orlms(Lee ('t al., 1999) is 
used for Kore, an tagging. Tim eXl)criln(;nl;~t\] re- 
sults show that lexicalized models l)erform bet- 
ter than non-lexicalized models and the simpli- 
fied back-off smoothing technique can mitigate 
data sparseness betl;er than silnple smoothing 
techniques. 
2 Ti le "s tandard"  HMM 
We basically follow the not~ti(m of (Charniak 
et al, 1993) to describe Bayesian models. In 
this paper, we assume that {w I , 'w~,..., w ~0 } is 
a set of words, {t t , t '2 , . . . , t ;}  is a set of POS 
tags, a sequence of random variables l'lq,,~ = 
l~q lazy... I'E~ is a sentence of n words, and a 
sequence of random w~riables T1,,, = 7~T,2... TT~ 
is a sequence of n POS tags. Because each of 
random wtrbflfles W can take as its value any 
of the words in the vocabulary, we denote the 
value of l'l(i by wi mM a lmrticular sequence of 
wflues tbr H~,j (i < j) by wi, j. In a similar wl.ty, 
we denote the value of Ti by l,i and a particular 
481 
sequence of values for T/,j (i _< j) t)y ti,j. For 
generality, terms wi,j and ti,j (i > j) are defined 
as being empty. 
Tile purpose of Bayesian models for POS tag- 
ging is to find the most likely sequence of POS 
tags for a given sequence of' words, as follows: 
= arg lnaxPr (T , ,n  =- I W,,,, = w,, ,d 
tl,n 
Because l'efhrence to the random variables 
thelnselves can 1)e oulitted, the above equation 
b eco lnes :  
T('wl,n) = argmax Pr(tl,n \[ wl,,z) (1) 
~'l,~t 
Now, Eqn. 1 is transtbrnled into Eqn. 2 since 
Pr(wl,n) is constant for all tq,~, 
Pr (l.j ,n, wl,n) 
T(*/q,n) -- argmax 
t ,  .... Pr('wl,n) 
= arDnaxP,'(tj,,~,w,,,,) (2) 
tl ,n 
Then, tile prolmbility Pr(tL,z, wl,n ) is broken 
down into Eqn. 3 by using tile chain rule. 
fl(Pr(ti,t\],i-l,Wl,i-1) ) 
Pr(tl,n,~q,r,,) = x Pr(/~i \[tl,i,~Vl,i-l) (3) 
i= l  
Because it is difficult to compute Eqn. 3, the 
standard ItMM simplified it t)3; making a strict 
Markov assumption to get a more tract~d)le 
tbrm. 
Pr(tl,,,, Wl,n) ~ x Pr(wi I td (4) 
i= l  
I51 the standard HMM, the probability of the 
current tag ti depends oi5 only the previous K 
tags ti-K,i-1 and the t)robability of' the cur- 
rent word wi depends on only the current ag 1. 
Thereibre, this model cannot consider lexical in- 
formation in contexts. 
3 Lex ica l i zed  HMMs 
In English POS tagging, the tagging unit is a 
word. On the contrary, Korean POS tagging 
prefers a morpheme 2. 
1Usually, K is determined as1 (bigram as in (Char- 
niak et al, 1993)) or 2 (trigram as in (Merialdo, 1991)). 
2The main reason is that the mtmber of word-unit 
tags is not finite because I(orean words can be ti'eely 
and newly formed l)y agglutinating morphemes(Lee t 
al., 1999).

Figure 1 shows a word-unit lattice of an Eil- 
glish sentence, "Flies like a flowc'r.", where each

ure 2 shows a morpheme-unit lattice of a Ko- 
rean sentence, "NcoNeun tIal Su issDa.", where 
each node has a morphenm and its morI)heme- 
unit tag. In case of Korean, transitions across 
a word boundary, which are depicted by a solid 
line, are distinguished fl'om transitions within a 
word, which are depicted by a dotted line. ill 
both cases, sequences connected by bold lines

3.1 Word-un i t  mode ls  
Lexicalized HMMs fbr word-unit agging are de- 
fined 1)y making a less strict Markov assmnp- 
tion, as tbllows: 
A(T(K,j), W( I ; j ) )~  Pr(tl,,~,wl,n) 
i=\] x Pr(wi I ti-L,i, wi-I , i -1) 
Ill models A(T(K,j), 14/(L j)) ,  the probability of 
the current tag ti depends on both tile previ- 
ous I f  tags t i -K, i - i  and the previous d words 
wi- j , i - i  and the probability of the current word 
'wi depends on the current ag and the previous 
L tags ti_L, i and the previous I words wi-l , i -~. 
So, they can consider lexieal inforination. In ex- 
periments, we set I f  as 1 or 2, J as 0 or K, L as 
1 or 2, and 1 as 0 or L. If J and I are zero, the 
above models are non-lexicalized models. Oth- 
erwise, they are lexicalized models.

In a similar way to the case of word-unit; tag-

3.3  Parameter  es t imat ion  
In supervised lcarning~ the simpliest parameter 
estimation is the maximum likelihood(ML) cs- 
t imation(Duda et al, 1973) which lnaximizes 
the i)robal)ility ot! a training set. The ML esti- 
mate of tag (K+l ) -gram i)robal)ility, PrML (f;i \[ 
t,i-K,i-i), is calculated as follows:

(Kim et al, 1998) did not consider word-spacing.

where the flmction Fq(x) returns the fl:equency 
of x in the training set. When using the max- 
imum likelihood estimation, data sparseness i
more serious in lexicalized models than in non- 
lexicalized models because the former has even 
more parameters than the latter. 
In (Chen, 1996), where various smoothing 
techniques was tested for a language model 
by using the perplexity measure, a back-off 
smoothing(Katz, 1987) is said to perform bet- 
ter on a small traning set than other methods. 
In the back-off smoothing, the smoothed prob- 
ability of tag (K+l ) -gram PrsBo(ti \[ ti-l~,i-l) 
is calculated as tbllows: 
Pr (ti \[ ti-I(,i-~) = 
,5'1~20 
drPrML(ti \[ti-I(,i-1) " if r>0 (11) 
c~(ti-K,i-1) Prsso(ti \[ ti-K+l,i-l)if r = 0 
where r = Fq(ti_t(,i), r* = ( r+ 1)'nr+l 
7~, r
r* (r+l.) x~%.+l 
dr  ~ F l t l  
1-  (r+l)xm.+l 
n l  
n,. denotes the nmnber of (K+l ) -gram whose 
frequency is r, and the coefficient dr is called 
the discount ratio, which reflects the Good- 
~lhtring estimate(Good, 1953) 4. Eqn. 11 means 
that Prxgo(ti \[ ti-K,i-l) is under-etimated by 
dr than its maximum likelihood estimate, if 
r > 0, or is backed off by its smoothing term 
Prsuo(ti \[ ti-K+j,i-l) in proportion to the 
value of the flmction (~(ti-K,i-t) of its condi- 
tional term ti-K,i-1, if r = 0. 
However, because Eqn. 11 requires compli- 
cated computation in ~(ti-l(,i-1), we simI)lify 
it to get a flmction of the frequency of a condi- 
tional term, as tbllows: 
ct(Fq(ti-K,i-1) = f) = 
E\[Fq(ti-I(,i-1) = f\] Ax E7-o E\[Fq(ti-K,i-1) -= f\] 
where A = 1 - ~ Pr (tglti-/c,i-,), 
SBO ti--K,i~r>O 
E\[Fq(ti-g,i-1) = f\] = 
SP\]to ( ti \[ti-K + l,i-1) 
t i -  K + L i,r=O,F q( t i -  K, i -1)= f ' 
(12) 
In Eqn. 12, the range of .f is bucketed into 7 
4Katz  said that  d,. = i if r > 5. 
regions such as f = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and f > 6 since 
it is also difficult to compute this equation tbr 
all possible values of f .  
Using the formalism of our simplified back-off 
smoothing, each of probabilities whose ML es- 
timate is zero is backed off by its corresponding 
smoothing term. In experiments, the smooth- 
ing terms of Prsl~o(ti \[ ti-K,i-l,~t)i-,l,i-l) are  
determined as follows: 
PI'sBo(ti\[ ti-Ii+l,i-h )if K> 1,d> 1 
wi_j+~,i_~ 
Prsuo(ti i fK  >_ 1, d = 1 
Prs13o(ti \[ ti-K+Li-l) if K > 1, J = 0 
PrAD(ti) if K = 0, J = 0 
Also, the snloothing terms of' Pl's\]~o(wi 
ti_L,i, Wi_l,i_ 1 ) are determined as follows: 
\[ Prst~o(wi 
Prsuo  (wi 
Prs,o (wi 
PrsBO(Wi) 
PrA.O i) 
ti-L+~,i, ) if L _> 1, I>  1 
i l ) i - I+ l  , i - I  
ti-L,i) if L _> 1, I = 1 
ti-L+Li) if L >_ 1, I = 0 
i f L  = 0, I --= 0 
i l L  = -1 ,  I = 0 
In Eqn. 13 and 14, the smoothing term of a 
unigram probability is calculated by using an 
additive smoothing with 5 = 10 .2 which is cho- 
sen through experiments. The equation for the 
additive smoothing(Chen, 1996) is as tbllows: 
Fq(ti-t(,i) + 5 
AD ~tl (Fq(ti-lf,i) + 5) 
In a similar way, the smoothing terms of param- 
eters in Eqn. 9 ~re determined. 
3.4 Model  decoding 
h'om the viewpoint of the lattice structure, the 
t)roblem of POS tagging can be regarded as the 
problem of finding the most likely path ti'om the 
start node ($/$) to the end node ($/$). The 
Viterbi search algorithm(Forney, 1973), which 
has been used for HMM decoding, can be effec- 
tively applied to this task just with slight mod- 
ification 5.

ability less than 10 -9  a re  smoothed and re- 
placed by 10-9? Because, in the outside-test, 
AD(d = 10 -2) performs better than ML and 
kD(a ? 10-2), we use 5 = 10 -2 in our ad- 
ditive smoothing. According to Table 2, SBO 
I)ertbrms well even in the simplest HMM. 
Figure 3 illustrates 4 graphs'about the results 
of English tagging: (a) the number of param- 
eters in each model, (b) the accuracy of each 
model tbr the training set, (c) the accuracy of 
each model for the test set, and (d) the accuracy 
of each model with SBO tbr both training and 
test set. Here, labels in x-axis sI)ecify models 
K,  ,1 in the way that ~ denotes A(T(\];,j) , W(Lj)). 
Therefore, the first 6 models are non-lexicalized 
models and tile others are lexicalized models. 
Actually, SBO uses more parameters than 
others. The three smoothing methods, ML, 
AD, SBO, perform well for the training set; 
since the inside-tests usually have little data 
sparseness. On the other hand, tbr the un- 
seen test set, the simple methods, ML and 
AD, cannot mitigate the data sparseness prob- 
lem, especially in sophisticated models. How- 
ever, our method SBO can overcome the prob- 
lem, as shown in Figure 3(c). Also, we can 
see in Figure 3(d) that some lexicalized mod- 
els achieve higher accuracy than non-lexicalized 
models. We can say that the best lexicalized 
model, A(T(1,~),W(1,1)) using SBO, improved 
the simple bigram model, A(T(L0),W(0,0)) us- 
? ~ 0 mg SBO, from 97.19>/o to 97.87~ (the error re- 
duction ratio of 24.20%). Interestingly, some 
lexicalized models (such as A(T(1,1), W-(0,0)) and 
A(T(1,1), W(1,o))), which have a relatively small 
number of paranmters, perform better than 
non-lexicalized models in the case of outside- 
tests using SBO. Untbrtunately, we cannot ex-

Figure 4: Results of Korean tagging 
pect the result of outside-tests from that of 
inside-tests because there is no direct relation 
t)etween them 
Figm:e 4 includes 2 graphs about the re- 
sults of Korean tagging: (a) the outside ac- 
curacy of each model A(C(K,j),MiL,I)) and 
(b) the outside accnracy of each model 
A(C\[s\](~-g),M\[s\](L,0) with/without considering 
word-spacing when using SBO. Here, labels in 
K,J de-  x-axis specify models in the way that ,7,, 
notes A(C\[s\](K,j),i~/I\[.~\](Lj)) and, tbr example, 
C , ,M in (b) denotes k(C~(,r,j), M(L,r)). 
As shown in Figure 4, the simple meth- 
ods, ML and AD, cannot mitigate that sparse- 
data problem, t)ut our method SBO can over- 
come it. Also, some lexicalized models per- 
tbrm better than non-lexicalized models. On 
the other hand, considering word-spacing ives 
good clues to the models sometimes, but yet 
we cannot sw what is the best ww. From 
the experimental results, we can say that the 
best model, A(C(9,2),M(2,2)) using SBO, im- 
proved the previous models, A(C(1,0), M(o,o)) us- 
486 
ing ML(Lee, 1995), and A(G(,,0), M(0,0))using 
ML(Kim et al, 1998), t'ronl 94.97% and 95.05% 
to 96.98% (the error reduction ratio of 39.95% 
mid 38.99%) respectively. 
5 Conc lus ion  
We have 1)resented unitbrmly lexicalized HMMs 
for POS tagging of English and Korean. In 
the models, data sparseness was etlix:tively mit- 
igated by using our simplified ba(-k-ofl" smooth- 
ing. From the ext)eriments, we have ol)served 
that lexical intbrmation is usefifl fi)r POS tag- 
ging in HMMs, as is in other models, and 
ore" lexicalized models improved non-lexicalized 
models by the error reduction ratio of 24.20% 
(in English tagging) and 39.95% (in Korean tag- 
ging). 
G('.nerally, the mfiform extension of models 
requires ral)id increase of parameters, and hence 
suffers fl'om large storage a.nd sparse data. l~.e- 
cently in many areas where HMMs are used, 
many eflbrts to extend models non-mfitbrmly 
have been made, sometimes resulting in notice- 
able improvement. For this reason~ we are try- 
ing to transfbnn our uniform models into non- 
mliform models, which may 1)e more effective 
in terms of both st)ace (:omt)h'~xity and relial)le 
estimation of I)areme|;ers, without loss of accu- 
racy.
