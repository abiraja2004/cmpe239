I. INTRODUCTION 
Wittgenstein has said, "If a lion could 
talk, we could not understand him" (1958). 
The point of this rather cryptic comment is 
undoubtedly Wittgenstein 's  contention that 
language or "language games" are embedded in 
what he termed "forms of life." That is, we 
are able to understand each other not just 
because we share common knowledge about the 
syntactic and semantic conventions for the 
use of words, but also because we share 
common knowledge about the forms of life or 
social real i ty within which we live and act. 
Wittgenstein 's  remarkable lion would 
presumably not share our social reality nor 
we have knowledge of the lion's social 
reality. Consequently, Wittgenstein would 
contend that this l ion's exhibit ion of 
speech would not result in our being able to 
communicate with him nor he with us. 
If Wittgenstein were here today, he 
might well contend that a computer that 
doesn't understand the forms of life of man 
wil l  not really be able to understand the 
speech of man. 
Such an assert ion would probably 
generate quite a bit of controversy amongst 
those of us interested in natural language 
understanding. Clearly, how one reacts to 
this assert ion will depend upon how one 
wishes to expl icate the notion of 
understanding. As a psychologist  pr imari ly 
interested in how persons understand and 
communicate with each other, I am incl ined 
tO take Wittgenstein 's  contention quite 
seriously. 
The work on belief systems, which will 
be discussed here, has been aimed at 
explor ing and expl icat ing this relat ionship 
between language use or language games and 
the larger social real ity or forms of life 
within which these language games are 
played. Consequently, the focus of this 
work has not been upon the parsing of 
sentences nor even upon the understanding of 
paragraphs, but rather upon the 
understanding of human action. 
In pursuing this line of research, it 
has been assumed that language use is not 
understood in this stronger sense of 
understand unless what someone says can be 
related to and understood in terms of the 
speaker's beliefs, intentions, and goals. 
The central notions in reasoning about 
human action are the concepts of a plan and 
of a reason or motive for performing a plan. 
A person's action is explained or understood 
when this action can be identi f ied as part 
of the actor's plan and the reason why the 
actor chose to perform that plan can be 
given. 
A model of how persons reason about 
human action must include then: (I) 
196 
assumptions about how actors reason about 
human action, that is, how a person arrives 
at a plan; (2) assumptions about what can 
count as a reason for a person choosing to 
perform or carry out a plan of action; and, 
finally, in order to use this theory as a 
recognizer of plans one must include (3) 
procedures for moving from the observat ion 
or l inguist ic report of actions to the 
ident i f icat ion of the plans and motivat ions 
that have generated these reported or 
observed actions of other persons. 
Natural language is used to describe, 
explain and evaluate human action and 
speaking is itself a human action. Thus, 
natural language provides both the 
meta- language that is used to discuss human 
action and the vehicle for performing the 
various human actions which Austin, Searle, 
and others (cf. Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969; 
Strawson, 1964; Gandhi, 1974) have referred 
to as speech acts. Consequently,  a goal of 
this research is to develop a system which 
will accept a l inguist ical ly  encoded 
descr ipt ion of a sequence of actions and 
then be capable of answering questions about 
the beliefs and motivat ions which the system 
believes explains these actions. 
Since natural language represents the 
meta- language within which human action is 
described and explained, natural language 
has been examined in order to identi fy the 
concepts which are pecul iar to the 
discussion of human action. Once these 
concepts are identif ied, then the problem is 
one of determining: (I) how to represent 
these concepts; (2) how these concepts are 
organized into a "theoret ical"  system; and 
(3) the nature of the processes which use 
this system of concepts to reason about 
reported or observed actions. In the 
development of BELIEVER some fair ly concrete 
ideas about the representat ion and 
organizat ion of these concepts have been 
developed and various procedures for using 
these concepts to identi fy the plans and 
purposes of the actors have been tried, but 
this latter problem remains an area where a 
great deal of work must yet be done. 
In order to try to communicate our 
thinking as succinct ly as possible the 
introduct ion of technical  notat ion will be 
avoided. The papers by Schmidt (1972; 
Schmidt and D'Addamio, 1973) and by Bruce 
(Bruce and Schmidt, 1974; Bruce, 1974) all 
focus upon representat ion and organizat ion.  
The papers by Schmidt(1973) and Brown(1974) 
discuss the implemetat ion of earl ier 
a lgor i thms for plan recognit ion and the 
interested reader is referred to these 
papers for addit ional  detai l  and technical 
discussion. 
The assumption that action is 
understood by attr ibut ing a plan and motive 
to the actor has highl ighted the importance 
of the fol lowing types of concepts which are 
found in natural language. Those concepts 
which have f igured prominent ly in the 
theoret ical  development are: (I) Acts such 
as: give, buy, say, ask, promise, help, ... 
(2) Act Relat ions such as: make possible, 
motivate, prevent, allow, ... (3) Cognit ive

States such as: believe, know, expect, ... 
(4) Disposit ional  Propert ies such as: can,

want, desire, ... (6) Role Relations such 
as: father of, friend of, ... and Role 
Terms such as: father, friend, customer, ... 
(7) Evaluative States such as: values, 
likes, hates, .... 
Conceptual types I through 3 above and 
the concept of "can" f igure most prominently 
in reasoning about plans, whereas conceptual 
types 5 through 7 and the concept of "ough%" 
are important ly involved in reasoning about 
motive. 
II. PLANS AND THE REPRESENTATION OF ACTS 
Cons idered  from the point of view 
developed here, a plan is not simply an 
appropr iate ly  structured sequence of 
actions. 
Rather, a plan is the internal 
representat ion or set of 'bel iefs about how a 
part icular goal may be achieved that is 
attr ibuted to the actor in order to explain 
the observed or reported actions of that 
part icular actor. This dist inct ion is 
important to recognize in thinking about 
human action. Fai lure to maintain this 
dist inct ion can lead one to consider the 
fol lowing two statements to be equivalent: 
(A) P performed act(i) and state(k) was a 
consequence of act(i) and state(k) enabled P 
to perform act(j). (B) P performed act(i) 
and state(k) was a consequence of act(i) and 
state(k) enabled P to perform act(j) and P 
performed act(i) in order to be able to 
perform act(j). 
It is obvious from the way in which A 
and B have been stated that B implies A but 
not the converse. The second statement 
attr ibutes to the actor the belief that 
doing act(i) would result in his being able 
to do act(j). Thus, the logic of explaining 
action in terms of plans involves more than 
a recognit ion of an intersect ion between a 
consequence of one act ion and a precondit ion 
on some subsequent action. If it did not 
our jails would be much fuller. 
If plans do involve beliefs of this 
type and if we agree that statement A does 
not imply statement B then precisely how are 
we able, as observers of actions, to move at 
t imes from an observat ion or report which 
sat isf ies A to a statement equivalent to B? 
One possib i l i ty  is that we might directly 
observe beliefs. Except for a few staunch 
bel ievers in ESP, this posit ion seems to 
have very few adherents. A second 
possibi l i ty is that we are able to make 
observat ions of one kind or another which 
are independent of the observed actions 
which al low us to regular ly and rel iably 
infer the bel ief states of others. There 
are a few psychologists who seem wil l ing to 
argue for this posit ion in pr inciple 
although I know of no psychological  evidence 
to support this position. In any case, it 
seems unl ikely that our commonsense theory 
of human action contains rules of inference 
of this type which have somehow escaped the 
notice of the scientists in psychology. 
197 
Having argued that beliefs are 
attr ibuted to another neither through a 
process of deduction nor a process of 
induction, the problem of trying to 
character ize exactly what kind of "logic" is 
involved remains. The logic of this type of 
reasoning may be roughly character ized in 
the fol lowing way. 
First, if the observer has made some 
observat ion which is of the form of 
statement A, then the observer recognizes 
that this observat ion counts as one reason 
for bel ieving that a statement of the form 
of B is the case. The observer may know or 
believe other proposit ions which may also 
count as reasons for bel ieving a proposit ion 
of the form of B and the observer may know 
or bel ieve stil l other proposit ions which 
may count as reasons for not bel ieving that 
a statement of the form of B correct ly 
character izes the bel iefs of the actor. 
Next, the consistency of these various 
reasons must be assessed. The action is 
understood when the observer has arr ived at 
some consistent set of reasons for 
attr ibut ing to the actor certain beliefs and 
motives which explain the actor's 
performance of the act ion in question. 
Now if this accurately character izes 
the reasoning process, then acts must, for 
purposes of reasoning about plans, be 
represented in a fashion that will yield 
access to the kinds of bel iefs that must be 
attr ibuted to the actor if his action is to 
be descr ibed using a part icular act concept. 
For example, the action "P handing a quarter 
to R" where P and R are two different 
persons, may under various c ircumstances be 
described as an act of "buying," "repaying," 
"helping," and so on. Which part icular  
descr ipt ion is most appropr iate wil l  depend 
upon whether or not there is a basis for 
at t r ibut ing to the actor, P, the addit ional  
bel iefs and motives that are implied by the 
concepts "buy," "repay," and "help. The 
class of actions termed speech acts has been 
extensively  discussed and the nature of our 
approach to represent ing acts may be br ief ly 
exempl i f ied by consider ing the speech act 
"request" or "ask." Table I presents in a 
very informal way the kinds of information 
which must be represented and associated 
with "request" in some way in order to 
capture the structure of the plan or subplan 
that "request" stands for. Those terms in 
Table I which have been capita l ized form the 
basis for the formal representat ion of 
speech acts. Except fo r  those statements 
which appear under the subheading of Outcome 
Possibi l i t ies,  each statement refers to 
psychological  states of the actors. Thus, 
an act name is simply a way of organiz ing a 
set of bel iefs about how a "move" of this 
type might be related to other moves or 
actions and to the cognit ive and 
mot ivat ional  states of the actors. 
The statements referred to as the Can 
Condit ions express those condit ions which 
must be true in order for this action to 
have been planned. CI expresses the fact 
that the agent must have bel ieved that he 
was able to transmit his message to the 
recipient. This is expressed at a very 
Act Name: Request 
Argument List: agent: A; recipient: R; message: M; requested 
response: X 
Can Condit ions: CI: A EXPECTS that A CAN CAUSE some action 
such that that action results in R KNOWING A's message. C2~ A 
EXPECTS that R will CHOOSE to UNDERSTAND A's message C3: A 
BELIEVES that R BELIEVES certain proposit ions; AND A EXPECTS that 
\[R's KNOWING A's message AND R BELIEVING certain proposit ions\]  
wil l  result in R BELIEVING: (I) A WANTS X (2) A WANTS R to CAUSE X 
(3) A BELIEVES that R CAN CAUSE X (4) A EXPECTS that A's 
REQUESTING may MOTIVATE R to CAUSE X (5) A BELIEVES tha,t R was NOT 
MOTIVATED to 
CAUSE X prior to A's REQUEST. 
Goal Hypotheses: GI: R BELIEVES that A WANTS R to CAUSE X 
G2: A's REQUEST may MOTIVATE R to CAUSE X

R BELIEVES that A is REQUESTING that R CAUSE X AND R EXPECTS to

general level by s ta t ingthat  any causing 
which the agent performs which brings about 
the recipient's knowledge of the agent's 
message can count as an action done in order 
to partially make possible the performance 
of the request. For example, uttering a 
sentence in the recipient's presence, 
sending the recipient a telegram or letter, 
requesting another person to give the 
message to the recipient, etc. are all 
actions which could under the appropriate 
circumstances be viewed as part of the 
agent's requesting X of the reclpien~. 
Thus, the information in CI provides a basis 
for generating hypotheses about how other 
observed actions might be related to this 
plan of requesting. 
Statements C2 and C3 differ from CI in 
that whereas CI states that some action of a 
particular type must be taken by the agent, 
statements C2 and C3 simply state 
expectations that the agent must have. 
However, by stating what conditions the 
agent must expect, these statements may also 
provide a basis for recognizing that 
previous actions are related to the plan of 
requesting. For example, if the agent first 
addresses the recipient by name, this action 
may have been done in order to provide a 
basis for expecting that the recipient will 
listen to his request. Similarly, the agent 
may precede a request for a ride home with a 
request for information about whether or not 
the recipient drove to work today. This 
information would provide the agent the  
basis for forming a belief about condition 
(3) of C3. 
Whereas the Can Conditions provide a 
basis for generating hypotheses about how 
previous actions might fit into the plan of 
requesting, the Goal Hypotheses provide the 
information needed to generate hypotheses 
about how the action of requesting might 
itself fit into some larger plan of the 
agent. 
For example, G2 provides the basis for 
the hypothesis that the purpose of the 
agent's request was to create in the 
recipient some set o f  beliefs that will 
partially provide the reason or motivation 
for the recipient to cause X. 
The Outcome Possibilities express the 
information needed to recognize cases where 
A's plan goes awry or generates side-effects 
which enable latter actions which were not 
the focus of the agent's plan. For example, 
someone might overhear the agent's request 
and offer to fulfill the agent's request. 
This would then be a very different 
situation from the one that might result 
from a similar offer from the intended 
recipient of the request. 
In 01, 02 and in the various normative 
statements the concept UNDERSTAND is 
introduced. UNDERSTAND is being used here 
in a technical sense that deserves comment. 
From the point of view of BELIEVER, part of 
the actor's knowledge of his social world is 
that other person's are capable of 
interpreting and coming to an understanding 
of any observed action. That is, other 
persons also possess belief systems and 
therefore in communicating with another one 
must recognize that the overt action, what 
has been termed the message, will be 
interpreted by others within the context of 
their beliefs about the actor's plan and 
motive. Thus, the theory of human action is 
essentially recursive. This is recognized 
more explicitly in the statement of C3 which 
states that the agent must select a message 
which when taken together with the agent's 
beliefs about the recipient's current 
beliefs can be expected to result in the 
recipient arriving at an understanding of 
the agent's action as a request. This 
characteristic of communication helps to 
explain why most everyday communication 
occurs in such an abbreviated form. To use 
a non-abbreviated form can be insulting 
since it could be interpreted by the 
recipient as a presupposition by the agent 
that the recipient is unable to recognize 
and understand the other's action. The term 
COMMUNICATIONACT is used in 01 and 02 in 
recognition of the fact that the recipient 
or observer of an action may understand the 
agent's action in a way other than that 
intended by the agent. 
The Motivational Hypotheses and 
Normative Obl igat ions  represent statements 
which are most importantly involved in 
reasoning about motive. The Motivational 
Hypotheses provide the basis for generating 
hypotheses about the agent's wants whereas 
the Normative Obligations provide 
information about the motivational side 
effects of performing actions to which 
various social norms apply. For example, NI 
is essentially a statement of the sincerity 
norm which applies to all communication acts 
and asserts that the communicator ought to  
believe what he is communicating. N2 states 
that it is improper to ignore someone whom 
you believe is speaking to you. 
N2 is related to C2 since N2 provides 
the norm which can be used to provide the 
basis for expecting another person to try to 
understand the agent's message. Finally, N3 
states that if the recipient has understood 
the agent's action as a request and if the 
recipient is not planning to fulfill that 
request, then the recipient ought to explain 
to the agent why he will not honor the 
request. Thus, this norm provides a basis 
for generating hypotheses about the 
recipient's response to the agent's request 
or the agent's response to the lack of a 
response from the recipient. This latter 
case is especially important since one of 
the interesting characteristics of human 
action is that under certain circumstances, 
the lack of a response counts as an action 
which itself must be explained. 
Clearly, if an act of omission is to be 
recognized, the observer must have a basis 
for expecting the act that was omitted. N3 
also provides the basis for various 
strategic actions. For example, the 
panhandler who asks a bypasser for a dollar 
and then demands with great moral 
indignation an explanation for the ? 
bypasser's lack of response is playing upon 
this particular norm. 
199 
Having focussed in some detail upon the 
representation of this one particular act, 
it is now possible to briefly and roughly 
state the position that this leads to 
concerning memory and inference. First, it 
is assumed that human conceptual memory is 
in some sense organized around various 
points-of-view. The representation sketched 
in Table I suggests the meaning" of 
"request" from our Belief System point of 
view. However, "request" also has a 
representation from a linguistic point of 
view and this would require that different 
kinds of information and relations be 
specified that would reflect this point of 
view. Thus, the general assumption is that 
concepts can play various roles in various 
"theories" that the Understander posseses. 
Which particular point of view is "active" 
at a particular time should depend upon the 
goals of the understanding system at that 
point in time. Thus, the position here is 
not that the kind of representation for the 
concept "request" that is presented in Table 
I rep laces  or is logically prior to a 
representation of "request" as a linguistic 
entity. 
Secondly, and more specifically with 
respect to the conceptual memory for 
concepts within the Belief Systems domain, 
the assumption has been made that the 
organization of knowledge reflects the role 
that that knowledge plays within the 
"theory" that the Understander uses to 
reason about the domain. The various 
subheadings provided in Table I and the 
discussion of this information was intended 
to reflect the view that the conceptual 
structures of human memory contain 
information about how they fit into or can 
be used to answer or reason about the 
various types of questions that must be 
generated and answered by a reasoning 
process that is attempting to understand an 
action in a particular way. Thus, these 
concepts are ,'hypotheses" laden structures 
which serve as the basis for generating the 
goals and subgoals of the reasoning process. 
From this point of view, reasoning about 
action is itself a goal driven process where 
the ',top-level" goals are to find a plan and 
a motive for the actor which explains his 
action. An attempt to view the actor's 
action as a request, provides the basis for 
generating new goals for the understanding 
system. That is, the request structure 
specifies the kind of additional information 
to be assembled which would count as reasons 
for viewing the observed act as a request. 
Finally, since it is assumed that the 
understanding of human action is a 
theory-driven process, it is also assumed 
that the representation of particular events 
in memory reflects the operation of this 
theory. Understanding is viewed as a 
constructive process and what will be 
remembered is not simply a representation of 
"what happened", but rather an organization 
and elaboration of what happened that 
reflects the way in which the observer has 
understood what happened.
