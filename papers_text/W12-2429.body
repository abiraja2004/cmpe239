Abstract
The most accurate approaches to Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) for biomedical docu-
ments are based on supervised learning. How-
ever, these require manually labeled training
examples which are expensive to create and
consequently supervised WSD systems are
normally limited to disambiguating a small set
of ambiguous terms. An alternative approach
is to create labeled training examples automat-
ically and use them as a substitute for manu-
ally labeled ones. This paper describes a large
scale WSD system based on automatically la-
beled examples generated using information
from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The labeled
examples are generated without any use of la-
beled training data whatsoever and is therefore
completely unsupervised (unlike some previ-
ous approaches). The system is evaluated on
two widely used data sets and found to outper-
form a state-of-the-art unsupervised approach
which also uses information from the UMLS
Metathesaurus.
1 Introduction
The information contained in the biomedical liter-
ature that is available in electronic formats is use-
ful for health professionals and researchers (West-
brook et al., 2005). The amount is so vast that
it is difficult for researchers to identify informa-
tion of interest without the assistance of automated
tools (Krallinger and Valencia, 2005). However,
processing these documents automatically is made
difficult by the fact that they contain terms that
are ambiguous. For example, ?culture? can mean
?laboratory procedure? (e.g. ?In peripheral blood
mononuclear cell culture?) or ?anthropological cul-
ture? (e.g. ?main accomplishments of introducing a
quality management culture?). These lexical ambi-
guities are problematic for language understanding
systems.
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process
of automatically identifying the meanings of am-
biguous terms. Some WSD systems for the biomed-
ical domain are only able to disambiguate a small
number of ambiguous terms (see Section 2). How-
ever, for WSD systems to be useful in applications
they should be able to disambiguate all ambiguous
terms. One way to create such a WSD system is to
automatically create the labeled data that is used to
train supervised WSD systems. Several approaches
(Liu et al., 2002; Stevenson and Guo, 2010; Jimeno-
Yepes and Aronson, 2010) have used information
from the UMLS Metathesaurus1 to create labeled
training data that have successfully been used to cre-
ate WSD systems.
A key decision for any system that automatically
generates labeled examples is the number of exam-
ples of each sense to create, known as the bias of the
data set. It has been shown that the bias of a set of la-
beled examples affects the performance of the WSD
system it is used to train (Mooney, 1996; Agirre and
Mart??nez, 2004b). Some of the previous approaches
to generating labeled data relied on manually anno-
tated examples to determine the bias of the data sets
and were therefore not completely unsupervised.
This paper describes the development of a large
scale WSD system that is able to disambiguate all
1http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/
231
terms that are ambiguous in the UMLS Metathe-
saurus. The system relies on labeled examples that
are created using information from UMLS. Various
bias options are explored, including ones that do not
make use of information from manually labeled ex-
amples, and thus we can create a completely unsu-
pervised system. Evaluation is carried out on two
standard datasets (the NLM-WSD and MSH-WSD
corpora). We find that WSD systems can be cre-
ated without using any information from manually
labeled examples and that their performance is bet-
ter than a state-of-the-art unsupervised approach.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Previous approaches to WSD in biomedical
documents are described in the next Section. Section
3 presents the methods used to identify bias in the
labeled examples and WSD system. Experiments in
which these approaches are compared are described
in Section 4 and their results in Section 5.
2 Background
Many WSD systems for the biomedical domain are
based on supervised learning (McInnes et al., 2007;
Xu et al., 2007; Stevenson et al., 2008; Yepes and
Aronson, 2011). These systems require labeled
training data, examples of an ambiguous term la-
beled with the correct meaning. Some sets of labeled
data have been developed for the biomedical domain
(Weeber et al., 2001; Savova et al., 2008; Jimeno-
Yepes et al., 2011). However, these data sets only
contain examples for a few hundred terms and can
only be used to develop WSD systems to identify
the meanings of those terms. The process of creat-
ing labeled examples is extremely time-consuming
and difficult (Artstein and Poesio, 2008), making it
impractical to create labeled examples of all possible
ambiguous terms found in biomedical documents.
Two alternative approaches have been explored to
develop systems which are able to disambiguate all
ambiguous terms in biomedical documents. The first
makes use of unsupervised WSD algorithms (see
Section 2.1) and the second creates labeled data au-
tomatically and uses it to train a supervised WSD
system (see Section 2.2).
2.1 Unsupervised WSD
Unsupervised WSD algorithms make use of infor-
mation from some knowledge source, rather than re-
lying on training data.
Humphrey et al. (2006) describe an unsupervised
system which uses semantic types in UMLS to dis-
tinguish between the possible meanings of ambigu-
ous words. However, it cannot disambiguate be-
tween senses with the same semantic type, i.e., it
is not possible for the system to recognise all sense
distinctions.
The Personalised Page Rank (PPR) system
(Agirre et al., 2010; Jimeno-Yepes and Aronson,
2010) relies on a a graph-based algorithm similar
to the Page Rank algorithm originally developed for
use in search engines (Brin, 1998). It performs
WSD by converting the UMLS Metathesaurus into
a graph in which the possible meanings of ambigu-
ous words are nodes and relations between them are
edges. Disambiguation is carried out by providing
the algorithm with a list of senses that appear in the
text that is being disambiguated. This information is
then combined with the graph and a ranked list of the
possible senses for each ambiguous word generated.
Unsupervised systems have the advantage of be-
ing able to disambiguate all ambiguous terms. How-
ever, the performance of unsupervised systems that
have been developed for biomedical documents is
lower than that of supervised ones.
2.2 Automatic Generation of Labeled Data
Automatic generation of labeled data for WSD com-
bines the accuracy of supervised approaches with
the ability of unsupervised approaches to disam-
biguate all ambiguous terms. It was first suggested
by Leacock et al. (1998). Their approach is based
on the observation that some terms in a lexicon oc-
cur only once and, consequently, there is no doubt
about their meaning. These are referred to as being
monosemous. Examples for each possible meaning
of an ambiguous term are generated by identifying
the closest monosemous term (the monosemous rel-
ative) in the lexicon and using examples of that term.
Variants of the approach have been applied to the
biomedical domain using the UMLS Metathesaurus
as the sense inventory.
232
Liu et al. (2002) were the first to apply the
monosemous relatives approach to biomedical WSD
and use it to disambiguate a set of 35 abbreviations.
They reported high precision but low recall, indicat-
ing that labeled examples could not be created for
many of the abbreviations. Jimeno-Yepes and Aron-
son (2010) applied a similar approach and found
that it performed better than a number of alternative
approaches on a standard evaluation resource (the
NLM-WSD corpus) but did not perform as well as
supervised WSD. Stevenson and Guo (2010) com-
pared two techniques for automatically creating la-
beled data, including the monosemous relatives ap-
proach. They found that the examples which were
generated were as good as manually labeled exam-
ples when used to train a supervised WSD system.
However, Stevenson and Guo (2010) relied on la-
beled data to determine the number of examples of
each sense to create, and therefore the bias of the
data set. Consequently their approach is not com-
pletely unsupervised since it could not be applied to
ambiguous terms that do not have labeled training
data available.
3 Approach
3.1 WSD System
The WSD system is based on a supervised approach
that has been adapted for the biomedical domain
(Stevenson et al., 2008). The system was tested on
the NLM-WSD corpus (see Section 4.1) and found
to outperform alternative approaches.
The system can exploit a wide range of fea-
tures, including several types of linguistic informa-
tion from the context of an ambiguous term, MeSH
codes and Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) from
the UMLS Metathesaurus. However, computing
these features for every example is a time consum-
ing process and to make the system suitable for large
scale WSD it was restricted to using a smaller set
of features. Previous experiments (Stevenson et al.,
2008) showed that this only leads to a small drop in
disambiguation accuracy while significantly reduc-
ing the computational cost of generating features.
3.1.1 Features
Two types of context words are used as features:
the lemmas of all content words in the same sen-
tence as the ambiguous word and the lemmas of all
content words in a?4-word window around the am-
biguous term. A list of corpus-specific stopwords
was created containing terms that appear frequently
in Medline abstracts but which are not useful for dis-
ambiguation (e.g. ?abstract?, ?conclusion?). Any
lemmas found in this list were not used as features.
3.1.2 Learning algorithm
Disambiguation is carried out using the Vector
Space Model, a memory-based learning algorithm
in which each occurrence of an ambiguous word is
represented as a vector created using the features ex-
tracted to represent it (Agirre and Mart??nez, 2004a).
The Vector Space Model was found to outperform
other learning algorithms when evaluated using the
NLM-WSD corpus (Stevenson et al., 2008).
During the algorithm?s training phase a single
centroid vector, ~Csj , is generated for each possible
sense, sj . This is shown in equation 1 where T is
the set of training examples for a particular term and
sense(~t) is the sense associated with the vector ~t.
~Csj =
?
~ti  T :sense(~ti)=sj
~ti
|~ti  T : sense(~ti) = sj |
(1)
Disambiguation is carried out by comparing the
vector representing the ambiguous word, ~a, against
the centroid of each sense using the cosine metric,
shown in equation 2, and choosing the one with the
highest score.
score(sj ,~a) = cos( ~Csj ,~a) =
~Csj .~a
| ~Csj ||~a|
(2)
Note that the learning algorithm does not ex-
plicitly model the prior probability of each possi-
ble sense, unlike alternative approaches (e.g. Naive
Bayes), since it was found that including this infor-
mation did not improve performance.
3.2 Automatically generating training
examples
The approaches used for generating training exam-
ples used here are based on the work of Stevenson
and Guo (2010), who describe two approaches:
1. Monosemous relatives
2. Co-occurring concepts
233
Both approaches are provided with a set of ambigu-
ous CUIs from the UMLS Metathesaurus, which
represent the possible meanings of an ambiguous
term, and a target number of training examples to be
generated for each CUI. Each CUI is associated with
at least one term and each term is labeled with a lex-
ical unique identifier (LUI) which represents a range
of lexical variants for a particular term. The UMLS
Metathesaurus contains a number of data files which
are exploited within these techniques, including:
AMBIGLUI: a list of cases where a LUI is linked
to multiple CUIs.
MRCON: every string or concept name in the
Metathesaurus appears in this file.
MRCOC: co-occuring concepts.
For the monosemous relatives approach, the
strings of monosemous LUIs of the target CUI
and its relatives are used to search Medline to re-
trieve training examples. The monosemous LUIs re-
lated to a CUI are defined as any LUIs associated
with the CUI in the MRCON table and not listed in
AMBIGLUI table.
The co-occurring concept approach works differ-
ently. Instead of using strings of monosemous LUIs
of the target CUI and its relatives, the strings associ-
ated with LUIs of a number of co-occurring CUIs of
the target CUI and its relatives found in MRCOC ta-
ble are used. The process starts by finding the LUIs
of the top n co-occurring CUIs of the target CUI.
These LUIs are then used to form search queries.
The query is quite restrictive in the beginning and re-
quires all terms appear in the Medline citations files.
Subsequently queries are made less restrictive by re-
ducing the number of required terms in the query.
These techniques were used to generate labeled
examples for all terms that are ambiguous in the
2010 AB version of the UMLS Metathesaurus.2 The
set of all ambiguous terms was created by analysing
the AMBIGLUI table, to identify CUIs that are asso-
ciated with multiple LUIs. The Medline Baseline
Repository (MBR)3 was also analysed and it was
found that some terms were ambiguous in this re-
source, in the sense that more than one CUI had been
2Stevenson and Guo (2010) applied them to a small set of
examples from the NLM-WSD data set (see Section 4.1).
3http://mbr.nlm.nih.gov
assigned to an instance of a term, but could not be
identified from the AMBIGLUI table. The final list
of ambiguous CUIs was created by combining those
identified from the AMBIGLUI table and those find
in the MBR. This list contained a total of 103,929
CUIs.
Both techniques require large number of searches
over the Medline database and to carry this out ef-
ficiently the MBR was indexed using the Lucene
Information Retrieval system4 and all searches ex-
ecuted locally.
Examples were generated using both approaches.
The monosemous relatives approach generated ex-
amples for 98,462 CUIs and the co-occurring con-
cepts for 98,540. (Examples generated using the
monosemous relatives approach were preferred for
the experiments reported later.) However, neither
technique was able to generate examples for 5,497
CUIs, around 5% of the total. This happened when
none of the terms associated with a CUI returned
any documents when queried against the MBR and
that CUI does not have any monosemous relatives.
An example is C1281723 ?Entire nucleus pulpo-
sus of intervertebral disc of third lumbar vertebra?.
The lengthy terms associated with this CUI do not
return any documents when used as search terms
and, in addition, it is only related to one other CUI
(C0223534 ?Structure of nucleus pulposus of inter-
vertebral disc of third lumbar vertebra?) which is it-
self only connected to C1281723. Fortunately there
are relatively few CUIs for which no examples could
be generated and none of them appear in the MBR,
suggesting they refer to UMLS concepts that do not
tend to be mentioned in documents.
3.3 Generating Bias
Three different techniques for deciding the number
of training examples to be generated for each CUI
(i.e. the bias) were explored.
Uniform Bias (UB) uses an equal number of
training examples to generate centroid vectors for
each of the possible senses of the ambiguous term.
Gold standard bias (GSB) is similar to the uni-
form bias but instead of being the same for all pos-
sible CUIs the number of training examples for each
CUI is determined by the number of times it appears
4http://lucene.apache.org/
234
in a manually labeled gold standard corpus. Assume
t is an ambiguous term and Ct is the set of possible
meanings (CUIs). The number of training examples
used to generate the centroid for that CUI, Ec, is
computed according to equation 3 where Gc is the
number of instances in the gold standard corpus an-
notated with CUI c and n is a constant which is set
to 100 for these experiments.5
Ec =
Gc
?
ci  Ct
Gci,t
.n (3)
The final technique, Metamap Baseline Repos-
itory Bias (MBB), is based on the distribution of
CUIs in the MBR. The number of training examples
are generated in a similar way to the gold standard
bias with MBR being used instead of a manually la-
beled corpus and is shown in equation 4 whereMc is
the number of times the CUI c appears in the MBR.
Ec =
Mc
?
ci  Ct
Mci
.n (4)
For example, consider the three possible CUIs as-
sociated with term ?adjustment? in the NLM-WSD
corpus: C0376209, C0456081 and C06832696.
The corpus contains 18 examples of C0376209,
62 examples of C0456081 and 13 of C0683269.
Using equation 3, the number of training exam-
ples when GSB is applied for C0376209 is 20,
67 for C0456081 and 14 for C0683269. In the
Metamap Baseline Repository files, C0376209 has
a frequency count of 98046, C0456081 a count of
292809 and C0683269 a count of 83530. Therefore
the number of training examples used for the three
senses when applying MBB is: 21 for C0376209, 62
for C0456081 and 18 for C0683269.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Data sets
We evaluate our system on two datasets: the NLM-
WSD and MSH-WSD corpora.
5Small values for Ec are rounded up to ensure that any rare
CUIs have at least one training example.
6These CUIs are obtained using the mappings from NLM-
WSD senses to CUIs available on the NLM website: http:
//wsd.nlm.nih.gov/collaboration.shtml
The NLM-WSD corpus7 (Weeber et al., 2001) has
been widely used for experiments on WSD in the
biomedical domain, for example (Joshi et al., 2005;
Leroy and Rindflesch, 2005; McInnes et al., 2007;
Savova et al., 2008). It contains 50 ambiguous terms
found in Medline with 100 examples of each. These
examples were manually disambiguated by 11 an-
notators. The guidelines provided to the annotators
allowed them to label a senses as ?None? if none
of the concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus seemed
appropriate. These instances could not be mapped
onto UMLS Metathesaurus and were ignored for our
experiments.
The larger MSH-WSD corpus (Jimeno-Yepes et
al., 2011) contains 203 strings that are associated
with more than one possible MeSH code in the
UMLS Metathesaurus. 106 of these are ambiguous
abbreviations, 88 ambiguous terms and 9 a combi-
nation of both. The corpus contains up to 100 ex-
amples for each possible sense and a total of 37,888
examples of ambiguous strings taken from Medline.
Unlike the NLM-WSD corpus, all of the instances
can be mapped to the UMLS Metathesaurus and
none was removed from the dataset for our exper-
iments.
The two data sets differ in the way the number
of instances of each sense was determined. For
the NLM-WSD corpus manual annotation is used to
decide the number of instances that are annotated
with each sense of an ambiguous term. However,
the NLM-MSH corpus was constructed automati-
cally and each ambiguous term has roughly the same
number of examples of each possible sense.
4.2 Experiments
The WSD system described in Section 3 was tested
using each of the three techniques for determining
the bias, i.e. number of examples generated for each
CUI. Performance is compared against various alter-
native approaches.
Two supervised approaches are included. The
first, most frequent sense (MFS) (McCarthy et al.,
2004), is widely used baseline for supervised WSD
systems. It consists of assigning each ambiguous
term the meaning that is more frequently observed
in the training data. The second supervised approach
7http://wsd.nlm.nih.gov
235
is to train the WSD system using manually labeled
examples from the NLM-WSD and MSH-WSD cor-
pora. 10-fold cross validation is applied to evaluate
this approach.
Performance of the Personalised Page Rank ap-
proach described in Section 2.1 is also provided to
allow comparison with an unsupervised algorithm.
Both Personalised Page Rank and the techniques
we employ to generate labeled data, base disam-
biguation decisions on information from the UMLS
Metathesaurus.
The performance of all approaches is measured
in terms of the percentage of instances which are
correctly disambiguated for each term with the av-
erage across all terms reported. Confidence inter-
vals (95%) computed using bootstrap resampling
(Noreen, 1989) are also shown.
5 Results
Results of the experiments are shown in Table 1
where the first three rows show performance of the
approach described in Section 3 using the three
methods for computing the bias (UB, MMB and
GSB). MFS and Sup refer to the Most Frequent
Sense supervised baseline and using manually la-
beled examples, respectively, and PPR to the Per-
sonalised PageRank approach.
When the performance of the approaches us-
ing automatically labeled examples (UB, MMB and
GSB) is compared it is not surprising that the best re-
sults are obtained using the gold standard bias since
this is obtained from manually labeled data. Results
using this technique for computing bias always out-
perform the other two, which are completely unsu-
pervised and do not make use of any information
from manually labeled data. However, the improve-
ment in performance varies according to the corpus,
for the NLM-WSD corpus there is an improvement
of over 10% in comparison to UB while the corre-
sponding improvement for the MSH-WSD corpus is
less than 0.5%.
A surprising result is that performance obtained
using the uniform bias (UB) is consistently better
than using the bias obtained by analysis of the MBR
(MMB). It would be reasonable to expect that in-
formation about the distribution of CUIs in this cor-
pus would be helpful for WSD but it turns out that
making no assumptions whatsoever about their rel-
ative frequency, i.e., assigning a uniform baseline,
produces better results.
The relative performance of the supervised (MFS,
Sup and GSB) and unsupervised approaches (UB,
MMB and PPR) varies according to the corpus. Un-
surprisingly using manually labeled data (Sup) out-
performs all other approaches on both corpora. The
supervised approaches also outperform the unsuper-
vised ones on the NLM-WSD corpus. However, for
the MSH-WSD corpus all of the unsupervised ap-
proaches outperform the MFS baseline.
A key reason for the differences in these results is
the different distributions of senses in the two cor-
pora, as shown by the very different performance of
the MFS approach on the two corpora. This is dis-
cussed in more detail later (Section 5.2).
Comparison of the relative performance of the un-
supervised approaches (UB, MMB and PPR) shows
that training a supervised system with the automat-
ically labeled examples using a uniform bias (UB)
always outperforms PPR. This demonstrates that
this approach outperforms a state-of-the-art unsu-
pervised algorithm that relies on the same infor-
mation used to generate the examples (the UMLS
Metathesaurus).
5.1 Performance by Ambiguity Type
The MSH-WSD corpus contains both ambiguous
terms and abbreviations (see Section 4.1). Perfor-
mance of the approaches on both types of ambiguity
are shown in Table 2.

ticular using automatically generated examples with
a uniform bias (UB) outperforms using the bias de-
rived from the Medline Baseline Repository (MBR)
while using the gold standard baseline (GSB) im-
proves results slightly for terms and actually reduces
them for abbreviations.
Results for all approaches are higher when disam-
biguating abbreviations than terms which is consis-
tent with previous studies that have suggested that
in biomedical text abbreviations are easier to disam-
biguate than terms.
5.2 Analysis
An explanation of the reason for some of the re-
sults can be gained by looking at the distributions
of senses in the various data sets used for the ex-
periments. Kullback-Leibler divergence (or KL di-
vergence) (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) is a com-
monly used measure for determining the difference
between two probability distributions. For each term
t, we define S as the set of possible senses of t,
the sense probability distributions of t as D and D?.
Then the KL divergence between the sense probabil-
ity distributions D and D? can be calculated accord-
ing to equation 5.
KL(D||D?) =
?
s  S
D(s). log
D(s)
D?(s)
(5)
The three techniques for determining the bias de-
scribed in Section 3.3 each generate a probability
distribution over senses. Table 2 shows the average
KL divergence when the gold standard distribution
obtained from the manually labeled data (GSB) is
compared with the uniform bias (UB) and bias ob-
tained by analysing the Medline Baseline Reposi-
tory (MMB).
Corpus
Avg. KL Divergence NLM-WSD MSH-WSD
KL(GSB||MMB) 0.5649 0.4822
KL(GSB||UB) 0.4600 0.0406
Table 3: Average KL divergence of sense probability dis-
tributions in the NLM-WSD and MSH-WSD data sets.
The average KL divergence scores in the table
are roughly similar with the exception of the much
lower score obtained for the gold-standard and uni-
form bias for the MSH-WSD corpus (0.0406). This
is due to the fact that the MSH-WSD corpus was
designed to have roughly the same number of ex-
amples for each sense, making the sense distribu-
tion close to uniform (Jimeno-Yepes et al., 2011).
This is evident from the MFS scores for the MSH-
WSD corpus which are always close to 50%. This
also provides as explanation of why performance us-
ing automatically generated examples on the MSH-
WSD corpus only improves by a small amount when
the gold standard bias is used (see Table 1). The gold
standard bias simply does not provide much addi-
tional information to the WSD system. The situa-
tion is different in the NLM-WSD corpus, where the
MFS score is much higher. In this case the additional
information available in the gold standard sense dis-
tribution is useful for the WSD system and leads to
a large improvement in performance.
In addition, this analysis demonstrates why per-
formance does not improve when the bias gener-
ated from the MBR is used. The distributions which
are obtained are different from the gold standard
and are therefore mislead the WSD system rather
than providing useful information. The difference
between these distributions would be expected for

the MSH-WSD corpus, since it contains roughly the
same number of examples for each possible sense
and does not attempt to represent the relative fre-
quency of the different senses. However, it is sur-
prising to observe a similar difference for the NLM-
WSD corpus, which does not have this constraint.
The difference suggests the information about CUIs
in the MBR, which is generated automatically, has
some limitations.
Table 4 shows a similar analysis for the MSH-
WSD corpus when abbreviations and terms are con-
sidered separately and supports this analysis. The
figures in this table show that the gold standard and
uniform distributions are very similar for both ab-
breviations and terms, which explains the similar re-
sults for UB and GSB in Table 2. However, the gold
standard distribution is different from the one ob-
tained from the MBR. The drop in performance of
MMB compared with GBS in Table 2 is a conse-
quence of this.

6 Conclusion
This paper describes the development of a large
scale WSD system based on automatically labeled
examples. We find that these examples can be gener-
ated for the majority of CUIs in the UMLS Metathe-
saurus. Evaluation on the NLM-WSD and MSH-
WSD data sets demonstrates that the WSD system
outperforms the PPR approach without making any
use of labeled data.
Three techniques for determining the number of
examples to use for training are explored. It is
found that a supervised approach (which makes use
of manually labeled data) provides the best results.
Surprisingly it was also found that using information
from the MBR did not improve performance. Anal-
ysis showed that the sense distributions extracted
from the MBR were different from those observed
in the evaluation data, providing an explanation for
this result.
Evaluation showed that accurate information
about the bias of training examples is useful for
WSD systems and future work will explore other un-
supervised ways of obtaining this information. Al-
ternative techniques for generating labeled examples
will also be explored. In addition, further evaluation
of the WSD system will be carried out, such as ap-
plying it to an all words task and within applications.
