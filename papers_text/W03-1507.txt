Abstract 
Progress in human language technology 
requires increasing amounts of data and 
annotation in a growing variety of lan-
guages.  Research in Named Entity ex-
traction is no exception.  Linguistic Data 
Consortium is creating annotated corpora 
to support information extraction in Eng-
lish, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages 
for a variety of US Government-
sponsored programs.  This paper covers 
the scope of annotation and research tasks 
within these programs, describes some of 
the challenges of multilingual corpus de-
velopment for entity extraction, and con-
cludes with a description of the corpora 
developed to support this research.

research, technology development and education 
Introduction 
Ongoing research in human language technol-
ogy (HLT) requires vast amounts of data for sys-
tem training and development, plus stable 
benchmark data to measure ongoing progress.  Re-
searchers require greater and greater volumes of 
data, representing a broadening inventory of hu-
man languages and ever more sophisticated 
annotation.  This presents a substantial challenge to 
the HLT community because human annotation 
and corpus creation is quite costly.  New 
approaches to research require not tens but 
hundreds and thousands of hours of speech data, 
and millions of words of text.  The availability of 
high quality language resources remains a central 
issue for the many communities involved in basic 
technology development and education related to 
language.  The role of international data centers 
continues to evolve to accommodate emerging 
needs in the speech and language technology 
community (Liberman and Cieri 2002). 
The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) was 
founded in 1992 at the University of Pennsylvania, 
with seed money from DARPA, specifically to 
address the need for shared language resources.  
Since then, LDC has created and published more 
than 241 linguistic databases and has accumulated 
considerable experience and skill in managing 
large-scale, multilingual data collection and anno-
tation projects.  LDC has established itself as a 
center for research into standards and best prac-
tices in linguistic resource development, while par-
ticipating actively in ongoing HLT research.    
LDC has had a major role in creating annotated 
corpora and other resources to support named en-
tity extraction, as well as larger information extrac-
tion activities, for a number of years.  Current 
work in this area falls under a handful of research 
programs.  The DARPA Program in Translingual 
Information Detection, Extraction, and Summari-
zation (TIDES 2002) combines technologies in 
detection, extraction, summarization and transla-
tion to create systems capable of searching a wide 
range of streaming multilingual text and speech 
sources, in real time, to provide effective access for 
English-speaking users.  TIDES core languages are 
English, Mandarin and Arabic; second tier lan-
guages are Korean, Spanish, and Japanese.  The 
primary medium is text though this includes 
speech recognition output.  The TIDES research 
tasks require broadcast transcripts and news texts 
to be annotated for entities, relations, and events; 
categorized by topic; translated; summarized; and 
processed in a variety of other ways.   
Another of the TIDES Program goals is to pro-
duce technology that can be easily ported to handle 
new natural languages.  To this end, the TIDES 
Surprise Language Exercise (LDC 2003b) chal-
lenges researchers to produce working systems for 
a previously untargeted language within a con-
strained time span (for instance, a single calendar 
month).   
Currently operating under the TIDES umbrella, 
the Automatic Content Extraction program (NIST 
2002) builds on the successes of previous extrac-
tion research programs.  The objective of the ACE 
Program is to develop extraction technology to 
support automatic processing of source language 
data (in the form of natural text, and as text derived 
from Optical Character Recognition and Automatic 
Speech Recognition output).  This includes classi-
fication, filtering, and selection based on the lan-
guage content of the source data, i.e., the meaning 
conveyed by the data.  Thus the ACE program re-
quires the development of technologies that auto-
matically detect and characterize this meaning.  
The ACE research objectives are viewed as the 
detection and characterization of Entities, Rela-
tions, and Events.  LDC provides data and annota-
tions to support these program goals. 
Another DARPA program, Evidence Extraction 
and Link Detection (EELD 2002), draws on lin-
guistic resources created by LDC to promote its 
research goals.  The EELD program aims for de-
velopment of technologies and tools for automated 
discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evi-
dence contained in large amounts of classified and 
unclassified data sources.  EELD is developing 
detection capabilities to extract relevant data and 
relationships about people, organizations, and ac-
tivities from message traffic and open source data.  
LDC has provided domain-specific entity-tagged 
corpora in support of the EELD technology evalua-
tion.

3 Annotation 
From MUC to ACE 
While LDC's current resource development ef-
forts support ACE and related programs in particu-
lar, ACE is hardly the first program to tackle 
named entities and the larger information extrac-
tion problem.  The Message Understanding Con-
ference Program (MUC) (NIST 1999a) focused on 
named entity extraction, coreference relations 
among noun phrases, the identification of selected 
relations, and events.  High system performance 
within the English newswire domain motivated an 
expansion of the named entity task after MUC-7.  
In 1999, the DARPA Hub-4 NE Project (Chinchor 
et. al. 1999) expanded the domain of source data to 
include broadcast news transcripts.   
LDC joined the group of those developing cor-
pora to support named entity research in that same 
year, providing annotations for the TIDES Infor-
mation Extraction-Entity Recognition (IE-ER) task 
(NIST 1999b).  In the following year, LDC began 
to develop corpora and other resources to support 
the ACE program. 
ACE is substantially similar in scope to these 
earlier extraction programs, though slightly differ-
ent in focus.  ACE adds new varieties of annotated 
data to the information extraction domain. 
Annotators tag newswire, broadcast news 
transcripts and newspaper data.  Additionally, re-
search sites are evaluated on their performance on 
degraded ASR and OCR output.  Under the TIDES 
umbrella, the ACE program supports the multilin-
gual resource and system development, focusing 
currently on Chinese a
ACE also modifies the inventory of entity types 
targeted by the MUC tasks (Chinchor et. al. 1997).  
While MUC considered three entity types (person, 
organization, location), ACE further divides loca-
tions into geo-political entities and facilities, while 
the newest phase also adds weapons, substances, 
and vehicles (similar to the MUC artifact cate-
gory).  Coreference is preserved in ACE, while 
generic entities and metonymy are tackled explic-
itly. 
ACE brings together many of the separate tasks 
evaluated under different components of the MUC 
program.  All ACE tasks -- entities, relations and 
events -- evaluate not only recognition but also 
characterization of these phenomena.  While the 
MUC Template Relation and Scenario Template 
tasks targeted relations and events plus their attrib-
utes, the focus of these tasks was domain specific.  
ACE tasks, on the other hand, are defined to be 
more general and domain-independent.  
Named entity annotation is a core component of 
ACE, but the scope of the annotation required by 
the program builds substantially on this.  
3.1 The Task 
There are three main ACE tasks: Entity Detec-
tion and Tracking, Relation Detection and Charac-
terization, and Event Detection and 
Characterization.  
Entity Detection and Tracking is the most fun-
damental of the ACE tasks and was the sole focus 
of the ACE Pilot effort as well as ACE Phase One.  
The entity task provides a foundation for the re-
maining annotation and research tasks. ACE anno-
tators identify five types of entities (Mitchell et. al. 
2002).  The first two types, Person and Organiza-
tion, remain substantially similar to their defini-
tions under MUC.  Locations within ACE are 
limited to geographical entities such as land-
masses, bodies of water, and geological forma-
tions.  Two new entity types are tagged under 
ACE: Facilities, which include buildings and other 
permanent man-made structures and real estate 
improvements; and GPEs, which are geographical 
regions defined by political and/or social groups.  
GPEs are composite in nature, typically having a 
government, a populace, and a geographic loca-
tion, as well as some more abstract notion of state-
hood.   
A GPE subsumes and does not distinguish be-
tween a nation, its region, its government and its 
people.  However, annotators also assign a role to 
each textual reference (mention) of a GPE, indicat-
ing which of these aspects is most prominent for 
that mention.  In the example below, the two entity 
mentions refer to the governmental (rather than 
people or location) aspect of the entities, so in both 
cases the mentions would be tagged as GPEs with 
Organization roles: 
 
{Russia} recently held discussions with {the US} 
regarding the ongoing crisis. 
 
ACE annotators tag all mentions of each entity 
within a document, whether named, nominal or 
pronominal.  For every mention, the annotator 
identifies the maximal extent of the string that 
represents the entity.  Nested mentions are also 
captured.  Each entity is classified according to its 
type, and co-reference among mentions is re-
corded.  While the ACE Pilot Annotation effort did 
not explicitly deal with metonymic entities and 
generics, Phase One of ACE added these elements 
to the entity annotation and research tasks. 
Metonymy occurs when a single string of text 
makes reference to multiple entities.  Generally, 
these distinct entities are related to each other in 
some way.  For example, in this sentence,  
 
{Beijing} will not continue sales of anti-ship mis-
siles to {Iran}. 
 
Beijing, though literally referring to the name of 
the capital of China, is being used as a reference to 
the government of China.  The relationship be-
tween "Beijing the city" and "Beijing the seat of 
China's government" triggers this metonymic ref-
erence.  When metonymic references occur, ACE 
annotators create two separate entities, one for 
each reference. 
An entity is generic when it does not refer to a 
particular object or set of objects in the world.  
Generic entities include references to general types 
of objects, hypothetical objects and generalizations 
across sets of objects.  Annotators apply the rules 
of mention coreference to generic entities, and spe-
cifically classify each entity as specific or generic. 
In future ACE efforts the set of targeted entities 
will expand to include vehicles, weapons, and sub-
stances.  Entity subtypes will also be added. 
The second phase of the ACE program added 
relation detection and characterization to the suite 
of annotation and research tasks.  This task targets 
five relation types (Mitchell et. al. 2002b): Role, 
Part, Located, Near, and Social.  For example, 
Role relations link people to organizations and 
GPEs in employment, affiliate, and citizenship 
relationships.  The Social relation links people in 
personal, familial or professional relationships.  
Each relation type is further classified according to 
its subtype.  For instance, the Role relation in-
cludes Management, General Staff, Member, 
Owner, Founder, and Citizen-Of subtypes. 
For every relation, annotators identify two pri-
mary arguments (namely, the two ACE entities that 
are linked) as well as the relation's temporal attrib-
utes (Sundheim 2001).  Temporal information is 
drawn from pre-existing TIMEX2 1  annotation 
(Ferro et. al. 2001) wherever those values are ex-
plicitly linked to a relation.  LDC annotators also 
create more general, relative time attributes de-
                                                          
1 TIMEX2 annotation, supported by the ACE program, pro-
vides a framework for the normalized representation of tempo-
ral expressions.   
 
rived from the tense of the verb that heads the 
predication of the relation. Relations that are sup-
ported by explicit textual evidence are distin-
guished from those that depend on contextual 
inference on the part of the reader. 
The following is an example of an explicit rela-
tion of type Located: 
   
{President Bush} was in {New York} Thurs-
day. 
 
The textual evidence supports the relation between 
the entities President Bush and New York, with the 
temporal attributes was and Thursday.   
Future phases of ACE will refine the relation 
task to highlight new relations that are of particular 
interest to the program, and to allow finer categori-
zation of some existing types. 
ACE Phase Three adds a new challenge: recog-
nition and characterization of events.  Definition of 
a set of general event types and subtypes is cur-
rently underway.  Targeted types include Interac-
tion, Movement, Transfer, Creation and 
Destruction events.  Annotators label event argu-
ments (agent, patient and the like) and attributes 
(temporal, locative) according to a type-specific 
template.  They further tag the textual mention or 
anchor for each event and categorize it by type and 
subtype.  For example, the sentence below contains 
reference to an Interaction event.  
 
{Colin Powell} and {Jiang Zemin} held high-level 
talks in {Beijing} last week. 
 
Annotators extract the specific text reference to the 
event (held high-level talks); identify the meeting 
participants (Colin Powell, Jiang Zemin) as argu-
ments of the event; tag the locative (Beijing) and 
temporal (held, last week) attributes.  
The event task will expand in future phases of 
ACE to include additional event types and sub-
types, as well characterization of relations between 
events. 
3.2 The Process 
The large amounts of data, multilingual focus 
and the number and range of annotation tasks re-
quired by the ACE program lends itself to a team-
based approach to annotation.  A single project 
manager provides oversight for all LDC ACE ac-
tivities.  Language-specific lead annotators work 
directly with teams of part-time (typically student) 
annotators, providing training, monitoring progress 
and generally supervising the annotation staff.  The 
project manager works with lead annotators to de-
velop and maintain the formal ACE annotation 
task definitions and guidelines (LDC 2003a). 
The complexity of ACE annotation requires an-
notators with a solid background in linguistics, 
particularly syntax and semantics.  New annotators 
first become familiar with the basic concepts and 
terminology and study the annotation guidelines 
before annotating several sets of training files.  
Throughout the training process, supervisors pro-
vide periodic feedback, comparing the trainee?s 
annotation to a gold standard, identifying discrep-
ancies and refining the annotator?s approach to the 
data and understanding of guidelines and rules.  
Not until an annotator has achieved a certain level 
of accuracy and speed is he permitted to tag actual 
data.   
The annotation work environment is designed 
to encourage regular discussion and "groupthink" 
among the annotation team.  Problems and ques-
tions are logged for future reference, and teams 
meet regularly to discuss outstanding issues.  A 
web-based annotation manual contributes to the 
team approach.  This reference complements the 
formal task definition, documenting decisions 
about how to handle problematic constructions and 
outlier examples.  Because its content is developed 
solely by ACE annotators, the web guidelines also 
function as a training tool.  New annotators regu-
larly add to the guidelines, focusing on the aspects 
of the ACE tasks that are most difficult for them. 
During production annotation, separate annota-
tors conduct at minimum two complete passes over 
the data.  First pass annotation creates the initial 
markup, and a second pass reviews the existing 
annotation for consistency and accuracy.  Second 
passing is typically conducted by more experi-
enced senior annotators.  A targeted third pass is 
performed to further enhance annotation quality.  
During the third pass, lead annotators review the 
annotated data to catch common errors and ensure 
consistent treatment of difficult constructions.   
In addition to multiple passes over all ACE 
data, an additional 5% to 10% of the data is com-
pletely re-annotated from scratch by separate anno-
tators. Results of this dual annotation are compared 
and discrepancies adjudicated in order to establish 
inter-annotator agreement scores and identify areas 
of lingering confusion or inconsistency. While 
rates of inter-annotator agreement for ACE named 
entities are comparable to MUC consistency levels, 
the results for the more complex annotation tasks 
are considerably lower.  Particular challenges in-
clude the coreference of generic entities and the 
use of metonymy, GPE roles, and implicit vs. ex-
plicit relations. 
The first two phases of ACE annotation utilized 
MITRE's Alembic Workbench (Day 1997), which 
was customized for the ACE tasks.  With the ex-
pansion into new languages and the addition of 
events, LDC began development of a locally de-
signed, locally supported ACE toolkit.  Utilizing 
the Annotation Graphs model (Bird and Liberman 
2001), the toolkit provides for customized, plat-
form-independent, multilingual ACE annotation.  
At present the toolkit supports entity tagging only; 
focused relation and event tagging modules are 
under development.  The toolkit will also support 
customized functions for second passing, compari-
son and adjudication of dually-annotated files, and 
additional quality control features including que-
ries of the annotation database.   
3.3 
                                                          
Multilingual ACE 
In its first two phases the ACE program has fo-
cused primarily on English language data.  Under 
TIDES, the program has grown to include new lan-
guages.  LDC is supporting this expansion with 
production annotation in Arabic and Chinese, as 
well as exploratory work in Farsi. 
LDC has completed development of entity an-
notation guidelines in Chinese and Arabic.  Full-
scale Chinese annotation is well underway, while 
Arabic annotation is just beginning.  To move from 
the basic English tasks into Chinese, Arabic and 
Farsi, LDC draws on the expertise of fluent bilin-
gual linguists and language scholars.  These ex-
perts first fully learn the English annotation tasks 
and complete some training annotation in English.  
They then apply the English guidelines to texts in 
the target language, keeping careful note of any 
constructions that motivate changes or additions to 
the guidelines.  After several rounds of test annota-
tion in the target language, new guidelines are 
crafted in English, but with examples drawn exclu-
sively from the target language2.  The new guide-                                                                                           
2 This means that annotators for non-English ACE tasks must 
be fluent bilinguals.  Customarily, new annotators start by 
lines are then extensively tested with pilot annota-
tion by multiple annotators in the target language. 
Further modifications to the guidelines are made as 
new patterns in the data are observed. 
Each time a new language is targeted, lan-
guage-specific challenges emerge.  For Chinese, 
one of the most difficult problems is the lack of 
agreed-upon rules for word segmentation.  While 
English is written with white space around each 
new word, "word" is not a fundamental concept in 
Chinese, and characters are written without white 
space.  Because entity annotation requires annota-
tors to select both the maximal extent of a mention 
as well as the mention's head, it becomes difficult 
for annotators to agree on the exact series of char-
acters that constitute the head of a mention.  Anno-
tation guidelines for Chinese must include rules for 
dealing with this issue. 
Chinese also presents difficulties for tagging 
generic entities.  The rules for identifying generics 
in English rely in part on tests surrounding the ex-
istence of determiners.  However, determiners do 
not exist in Chinese, and this required the creation 
of  new annotation guidelines for generics that rely 
solely on context.  Similarly, Arabic often uses 
determiners in a way that is different from English.  
For instance, in Arabic it is common to use a con-
struction with a determiner when referring to a 
class of entities: 
 
The horse is a wonderful animal. 
 
rather than a bare plural, more common in English: 
 
 Horses are wonderful animals. 
 
The complexity of Arabic morphology presents a 
very different set of problems.  Unlike Chinese and 
English, Arabic commonly uses pronoun affixes.  
For ACE, this means that any annotation tool must 
allow partial words to be tagged as mentions of 
entities in Arabic, while disallowing this for other 
languages. 
In addition to these linguistic differences, some 
distinctive stylistic qualities of Chinese and Arabic 
news reporting present challenges for annotators 
and are worthy of note. 
 
learning the English ACE tasks then move into their language-
specific annotation.  This supports a consistent approach to 
annotation across the multiple languages despite the necessary 
language-specific modifications.   
Many of these challenges are based in cultural 
differences.  For example, many industries in 
China are government owned and operated.  Con-
sequently, names of organizations are often quite 
different than their English counterparts, and 
guidelines written with English naming conven-
tions in mind are inadequate for handling common 
Chinese name constructions like "Beijing School 
Number 4".  
Further, organizations located outside of China 
are often referred to with their country?s name pre-
ceding the company name.  This presents a chal-
lenge for annotator consistency, since it is often 
unclear whether to include the country as part of 
the extent of the company name.    
Arabic news sources regularly use very long 
sentences with multiple clauses.  This presents the 
annotator with different kinds of mention extent 
and coreference decisions than found in English 
news data. Mention extents are typically longer 
and contain more nested mentions, and pronominal 
references to entities are more easily confused. 
Another set of problems extends beyond any 
language-specific considerations; these have to do 
with the infrastructure needed to support a large-
scale multilingual data creation effort.  Finding 
qualified native speaker annotators with adequate 
training in linguistics and eligibility to work in the 
United States is a serious challenge.  Further, ex-
panding ACE into new languages is not simply a 
matter of addressing the linguistic questions, but 
also tackling the technical ones.  Maintaining data 
formats and annotation tools that can accommodate 
not only multiple annotation tasks, but also multi-
ple languages and multiple character sets and en-
codings presents a significant problem. 
Despite the range of issues described above, 
porting the ACE annotation task into new lan-
guages is relatively straightforward.  The funda-
mental work of moving into a new language for 
ACE involves identifying the syntactic and mor-
phological (i.e., surface) constructions that are 
used to refer to the entities, relations and events of 
interest.  This is not an insubstantial task, and re-
quires both the insights of trained linguists and 
many rounds of pilot annotation and exploration of 
the data.  However, the fundamental concepts tar-
geted by ACE, and the underlying semantic con-
tent discussed in the annotated texts, remain 
substantially similar from one language to the next.  
4 Corpora 
As part of the ACE program, and to further 
support both the DARPA TIDES and DARPA 
EELD Programs, LDC has developed a number of 
annotated corpora.  These corpora all draw on 
broadcast news, newspaper and newswire data.  
Sources include data from the Topic Detection and 
Tracking corpora, Chinese Treebank, Arabic Tree-
bank and other news materials.   
Corpus development for the ACE program be-
gan in 1999.  Initially, the Pilot Phase was de-
signed to develop a basic task definition for entity 
detection and tracking.  Multiple research sites in-
cluding MITRE, BBN, NYU, and LDC annotated 
the same set of 15,000 words of English data to 
establish a shared understanding of the annotation 
guidelines and resolve any inter-annotator discrep-
ancies.  This data supported technology evalua-
tions in May and November 2000.   
In ACE Phase 1, the research and annotation 
tasks were expanded to address metonymy and 
generic entities.  Multiple research sites joined 
LDC in annotating 180,000 words of training data 
to support a February 2002 evaluation.  LDC was 
solely responsible for annotating an additional 
45,000 words of evaluation data. 
ACE Phase 2 required research sites to addi-
tionally detect and characterize relations between 
entities.  During this phase of ACE, LDC acted as 
sole annotation site and also took on responsibility 
for developing and maintaining annotation guide-
lines.  Phase 2 used the entire ACE Phase 1 corpus 
as training data, and added an additional 45,000 
words of new evaluation data.  Both training and 
evaluation data were annotated for entities plus 
relations.  In support of the EELD Program, LDC 
annotators tagged another 30,000 words of do-
main-specific training data plus 20,000 words of 
test data for entities and relations.  A September 
2002 evaluation tested system performance for 
both Entities and Relations. 
LDC is currently producing English test data to 
augment the existing corpora in support of a Fall 
2003 TIDES extraction evaluation; in addition, 
LDC is creating data and annotations for multilin-
gual extraction research in Chinese and Arabic. 
100,000 words of Chinese Treebank and 10,000 
words of Arabic Treebank have already been anno-
tated for entities.    
Alongside corpus development, LDC is work-
ing in parallel to expand and refine the existing set 
of ACE tasks.  These modifications are being made 
with input from both the TIDES Extraction and 
ACE communities.  For ACE Phase 3, LDC will 
annotate 300,000 words of data in each of three 
languages: English, Chinese and Arabic; pilot an-
notation in Farsi is also targeted.  Ultimately, all 
three annotation tasks -- entities, relations and 
events -- will be represented in the data.  The cor-
pora developed by LDC to support ACE, EELD, 
and TIDES Extraction are currently available to 
program participants only (LDC 2003c).  General 
publication of the ACE Pilot and ACE Phase 1 
Corpora is slated for Summer 2003; upon publica-
tion, the data will be available to LDC members as 
well as non-members.  The remaining ACE and 
related corpora will be published after the conclu-
sion of these programs' evaluation cycles. 
Outside of the ACE program, LDC has devel-
oped a handful of additional resources for multi-
lingual extraction research.  As part of the TIDES 
Surprise Language Exercise, LDC collects and 
creates linguistic resources in a previously untar-
geted language in an extremely compressed time 
span.  During a two-week dry run in March 2003, 
the target was Cebuano, a language of the Philip-
pines.  Within the span of a few days, LDC created 
250,000 words of monolingual text, built a 20,000 
word lexicon, created 25,000 words of parallel 
text, built a morphological parser, and completed 
named entity tagging of 32,000 words of text.   
Given the severe time constraints of the exer-
cise, named entity annotators used a trimmed-
down version of the MUC Named Entity Guide-
lines rather than the more complex full MUC or 
ACE guidelines.  Despite the time constraints, in-
ter-annotator consistency remained high when 
LDC-tagged data was compared with data tagged 
by annotators at BBN.  A similar set of resources 
for a new surprise language will be developed dur-
ing the Surprise Language evaluation in June 2003.  
All of the data developed for Surprise Language is 
currently available to TIDES participants, and will 
be released as a general publication at the conclu-
sion of the Exercise.  
A final resource created to support named enti-
ties within information extraction more broadly is 
the Xinhua Chinese-English Named Entity list, 
created from Xinhua Newswire's proper name and 
who's who databases.  This corpus contains nearly 
one million proper names of various kinds, includ-
ing approximately 500,000 person names, 300,000 
place names, 30,000 organization names, and tens 
of thousands of other name types.  The data pro-
vides both Chinese to English and English to Chi-
nese name pairs.  This corpus, slated for 
publication in Summer 2003, is currently available 
to TIDES participants. 
Much of the material described above is based 
upon large volumes of text and speech best col-
lected from commercial providers.  Commercial 
sources may require the negotiation of agreements 
that permit the distribution of data to researchers 
while constraining the use of the material to lin-
guistic education, research, and technology devel-
opment. LDC coordinates all necessary intellectual 
property arrangements for data developed under 
multiple research programs including TIDES, 
ACE, and EELD to make resources gathered in 
this way available to the broader research commu-
nities.   
Sponsored common task research programs like 
TIDES and ACE rely heavily upon such shared 
resources.  LDC was in fact created specifically to 
facilitate research sharing.  In order to allow for 
expedited delivery of data to a group of researchers 
participating in a common task evaluation, LDC 
has developed a new data distribution method 
known as ECorpora.  ECorpora target expedited 
delivery of training and devtest data to support of 
formal evaluations.  Upon the conclusion of the 
formal task evaluation, pending negotiations with 
research sponsors and program coordinators, LDC 
publishes data more broadly to permit access to 
these valuable resources to all communities work-
ing in linguistic education, research, and technol-
ogy development.
