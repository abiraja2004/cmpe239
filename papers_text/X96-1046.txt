There have been four Text REtrieval Conferences 
(TRECs); TREC-1 in November 1992, TREC-2 in Au- 
gust 1993, TREC-3 in November 1994 and TREC-4 in 
November 1995. The number of participating systems 
has grown from 25 in TREC-1 to 36 in TREC-4, includ- 
ing most of the major text retrieval software companies 
and most of the universities doing research in text re- 
trieval (see table for some of the participants). The di- 
versity of the participating roups has ensured that 
TREC represents many different approaches to text re- 
trieval, while the emphasis on individual experiments 
evaluated in a common setting has proven to be a major 
strength of TREC. 
The test design and test collection used for document 
detection i  TIPSTER was also used in TREC. The par- 
ticipants ran the various tasks, sent results into NIST for 
evaluation, presented the results at the TREC confer- 
ences, and submitted papers for a proceedings. The test 
collection consists of over 1 million documents from di- 
verse full-text sources, 250 topics, and the set of rele- 
vant documents or "right answers" to those topics. A 
Spanish collection has been built and used during 
TREC-3 and TREC-4, with a total of 50 topics. 
TREC-1 required significant system rebuilding by 
most groups due to the huge increase in the size of the 
document collection (from a traditional test collection of 
several megabytes in size to the 2 gigabyte TIPSTER 
collection). The results from TREC-2 showed signifi- 
cant improvements over the TREC-1 results, and should 
be viewed as the appropriate baseline representing state- 
of-the-art retrieval techniques as scaled up to handling a
2 gigabyte collection. 
TREC-3 therefore provided the first opportunity for 
more complex experimentation. The major experiments 
in TREC-3 included the development of automatic 
query expansion techniques, the use of passages or sub- 
documents o increase the precision of retrieval results, 
and the use of the training information to select only the 
best terms for routing queries. Some groups explored 
hybrid approaches (such as the use of the Rocchio 
methodology in systems not using a vector space mod- 
el), and others tried approaches that were radically dif- 
ferent from their original approaches. 
TREC-4 allowed a continuation of many of these 
complex experiments. The topics were made much 
shorter and this change triggered extensive investiga- 
tions in automatic query expansion. There were also 
five new tasks, called tracks. These were added to help 
focus research on certain known problem areas, and in- 
eluded such issues as investigating searching as an inter- 
active task by examining the process as well as the out- 
come, investigating techniques for merging results from 
the various TREC subcollections, examining the effects 
of corrupted ata, and evaluating routing systems using 
a specific effectiveness measure. Additionally more 
groups participated ina track for Spanish retrieval. 
The TREC conferences have proven to be very suc- 
cessful, allowing broad participation in the overall 
DARPA TIPSTER effort, and causing widespread use of 
a very large test collection. All conferences have had 
very open, honest discussions of technical issues, and 
there have been large amounts of "cross-fertilization" of 
ideas. This will be a continuing effort, with a TREC-5 
conference scheduled inNovember of 1996.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Phase two of the TIPSTER project included two 
workshops for evaluating document detection (informa- 
tion retrieval) projects: the third and fourth Text RE- 
trieval Conferences (TRECs). These workshops were 
held at the National Institute of Standards and Technolo- 
gy (NIST) in November of 1994 and 1995 respectively. 
The conferences included evaluation ot only of the 
TIPSTER contractors, but also of many information re- 
trieval groups outside of the TIPSTER project. The 
conferences were run as workshops that provided a fo- 
rum for participating groups to discuss their system re- 
sults on the retrieval tasks done using the TIP- 
STER/TREC collection. As with the first two TRECs, 
the goals of these workshops were: 
? To encourage r search in text retrieval based on large- 
scale test collections 
? To increase communication among industry, 
academia, nd government by creating an open forum 
for exchange of research ideas 
? To speed the transfer of technology from research 
labs into commercial products by demonstrating sub- 
stantial improvements in retrieval methodologies on 
real-world problems 
? To increase the availability of appropriate evaluation 
techniques for use by industry and academia, includ- 
ing development of new evaluation techniques more 
applicable to current systems 
? To serve as a showcase for state-of-the-art retrieval 
systems for DARPA and its clients. 
The number of participating systems has grown from 
25 in TREC-1 to 32 in TREC-3 (see Table 1) and to 36 
in TREC-4 (see Table 2). These systems include most 
of the major text retrieval software companies and most 
of the universities doing research in text retrieval. Note 
that whereas the universities tend to participate very 
year, the companies often skip years because of the 
amount of effort required to run the TREC tests. 
By opening the evaluation to all interested groups, 
TIPSTER has ensured that TREC represents many dif- 
ferent approaches totext retrieval. The emphasis on di- 
verse experiments evaluated within a common setting 
has proven to be a major strength of TREC. 
The research done by the participating groups in the 
four TREC conferences has varied, but has followed a 
general pattern. TREC-1 (1992) required significant 
system rebuilding by most groups, due to the huge in- 
crease in the size of the document collection from a tra- 
ditional test collection of several megabytes in size to 
the 2 gigabyte TIPSTER collection. The second TREC 
conference (TREC-2) occurred in August of 1993, less 
than 10 months after the first conference. The results 
(using new test opics) showed significant improvements 
over the TREC- 1 results, but should be viewed as an ap- 
propriate baseline representing the 1993 state-of-the-art 
retrieval techniques as scaled up to handling a 2 giga- 
byte collection. 
TREC-3 provided an opportunity for complex experi- 
mentation. The experiments included the development 
of automatic query expansion techniques, the use of pas- 
sages or subdocuments to increase the precision of re- 
trieval results, and the use of training information to 
help systems elect only the best terms for queries. 
Some groups explored hybrid approaches ( uch as the 
use of the Rocchio methodology in systems not using a 
vector space model), and others tried approaches that 
were radically different from their original approaches. 
For example, experiments in manual query expansion 
were done by the University of California at Berkeley, 
and experiments in combining information from three 
very different retrieval techniques were done by the 
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH). For more 
details on the specific system approaches, ee the com- 
plete overview of the TREC-3 conference, including pa- 
pers from the participating groups \[1\]. 
TREC-4 presented a continuation of many of these 
complex experiments, and also included a set of five fo- 
cussed tasks, called tracks. Both the main tasks were 
more difficult -- the test topics were much shorter, and 
the test documents were harder to retrieve. Several 
groups made major changes in their retrieval algorithms, 
and all groups had difficulty working with the very short 
topics. Many interesting experiments were done in the 
tracks, including 10 groups that worked with Spanish

2. THE TASKS 
2.1 The Main Tasks 
All four TREC conferences have centered around two 
main tasks based on traditional information retrieval 
modes: a "routing" task and an "adhoc" task. In the 
routing task it is assumed that the same questions are al- 
ways being asked, but that new data is being searched. 
This task is similar to that done by news clipping ser- 
vices or by library profiling systems. In the adhoc task, 
it is assumed that new questions are being asked against 
a static set of data. This task is similar to how a re- 
searcher might use a library, where the collection is 
known, but where the questions likely to be asked are 
unknown. 
In TREC the routing task is represented by using 
known topics and known relevant documents for those 
topics, but new data for testing. The training for this 
task is shown in the left-hand column of Figure 1. The 
375 
participants are given a set of known (or training) topics, 
along with a set of documents, including known relevant 
documents for those topics. The topics consist of natu- 
ral language text describing a user's information eed 
(see section 3.3 for details). The topics are used to cre- 
ate a set of queries (the actual input to the retrieval sys- 
tem) which are then used against he training docu- 
ments. This is represented byQ1 in the diagram. Many 
sets of Q1 queries might be built to help adjust systems 
to this task, to create better weighting algorithms, and in 
general to prepare the system for testing. The results of 
this training are used to create Q2, the routing queries to 
be used against he test documents (testing task shown 
on the middle column of Figure 1). 
The 50 routing topics for testing are a specific subset 
of the training topics (selected by NIST). In TREC-3 
the routing topics corresponded to the TREC-2 adhoc 
topics, i.e., topics 100-150. The test documents for 
TREC-3 were the documents on disk 3 (see section 3.2). 
Although this disk had been part of the general training 
data, there were no relevance judgments for topics 
100-150 made on this disk of documents. This less- 
than-optimal testing was required by the last-minute un- 
availability of new data. 
In TREC-4 a slightly different methodology was used 
to select he routing topics and test data. Because of the 
difficulty in getting new data, it was decided to select 
the new data first, and then select topics that matched 
the data. The ready availability of more Federal Regis- 
ter documents suggested the use of topics that tended to 
find relevant documents in the Federal Register. Twen- 
ty-five of the routing topics were picked using this crite- 
ria. This also created a subcoUection of the longer, 
more structured Federal Register documents for later 
use in the research community. The second set of 25 
routing topics was selected to build a subeollection i
the domain of computers. The testing documents for the 
computer issues were documents from the Intemet, plus 
part of the Ziff coUection. 
The adhoc task is represented by new topics for 
known documents. This task is shown on the right-hand 
side of Figure 1, where the 50 new test topics are used 
to create Q3 as the adhoc queries for searching against 
the training documents. Fifty new topics (numbers 
150-200) were generated for TREC-3, with fifty addi- 
tional new topics created for TREC-4 (numbers 
201-250). The known documents used in TREC-3 were 
on disks 1 and 2, and those used in TREC-4 were on 
disks 2 and 3. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 give more details 
about he documents used and the topics that were creat- 
ed. The results from searches using Q2 and Q3 are the 
official test results ent to NIST for the routing and ad- 
hoc tasks.

Figure 1. TREC Main Tasks 
In addition to clearly defining the tasks, other guide- 
lines are provided in TREC. These guidelines deal with 
the methods of indexing and knowledgebase construc- 
tion and with the methods of generating the queries 
from the supplied topics. In general, they are con- 
structed to reflect an actual operational environment, 
and to allow as fair as possible separation among the 
diverse query construction approaches. Three generic 
categories of query construction were defined, based on 
the mount and kind of manual intervention used. 
1. Automatic (completely automatic query construc- 
tion) 
2. Manual (manual query construction) 
3. Interactive (use of interactive techniques to con- 
struct he queries) 
The participants were able to choose between two 
levels of participation: Category A, full participation, or
Category B, full participation using a reduced ataset 
(1/4 of the full document set). Each participating group 
was provided the data and asked to turn in either one or 
two sets of results for each topic. When two sets of 
results were sent, they could be made using different 
methods of creating queries, or different methods of 
searching these queries. Groups could choose to do the 
routing task, the adhoc task, or both, and were asked to 
submit he top 1000 documents retrieved for each topic 
for evaluation. 
2.2 The  Tracks  
One of the goals of TREC is to provide a common 
task evaluation that allows cross-system comparisons. 
This has proven to be a key strength in TREC. The sec- 
ond major strength is the loose definition of the two 
main tasks allowing a wide range of experiments. The 
addition of secondary tasks (tracks) in TREC-4 com- 
bines these strengths by creating a common evaluation 
376 
for tasks that are either elated to the main tasks, or are a 
more focussed implementation f those tasks. 
Five formal tracks were run in TREC-4: a multilin- 
gual track, an interactive track, a database merging 
track, a "confusion" track, and a filtering track. In 
TREC-3, four out of the five tracks were run as prelimi- 
nary investigations into the feasibility of running formal 
tracks in TREC-4. 
The multilingual track represents an extension of the 
adhoc task to a second language (Spanish). An informal 
Spanish test was run in TREC-3, but the data arrived 
late and few groups were able to take part. In TREC~ 
the track was made official and 10 groups took part. 
There were about 200 megabytes of Spanish data (the El 
Norte newspaper f om Monterey, Mexico), and 25 top- 
ics. Groups used the adhoc task guidelines, and submit- 
ted the top 1000 documents retrieved for each of the 25 
Spanish topics. 
The interactive track focusses the adhoc task on the 
process of doing searches interactively. It was felt by 
many groups that TREC uses evaluation for a batch 
retrieval environment rather than the more common 
interactive environments seen today. However there are 
few tools for evaluating interactive systems, and none 
that seem appropriate o TREC. The use of the interac- 
tive query construction method in TREC-3 demon- 
strated interest in using interactive search techniques, o 
a formal track was formed for TREC-4. The interactive 
track has a double goal of developing better methodolo- 
gies for interactive evaluation and investigating in depth 
how users search the TREC topics. Eleven groups took 
part in this track in TREC-4. A subset of the adhoc top- 
ics was used, and many different ypes of experiments 
were run. The common thread was that all groups used 
the same topics, performed the same task(s), and 
recorded the same information about how the searches 
were done. Task 1 was to retrieve as many relevant doc- 
nments as possible within a certain timeframe. Task 2 
was to construct the best query possible. 
The database merging task also represents a focussing 
of.the adhoc task. In this case the goal was to investi- 
gate techniques for merging results from the various 
TREC subcoUections (as opposed to treating the collec- 
tions as a single entity). Several groups tried these tech- 
niques in TREC-3 and it was decided to form a track in 
this area for TREC-4. There were 10 subcollections 
defined corresponding to the various dates of the data, 
i.e. the three different years of the Wall Street Journal, 
the two different years of the AP newswire, the two sets 
of Ziff documents (one on each disk), and the three sin- 
gle subcollections (the Federal Register, the San Jose 
Mercury News, and the U.S. Patents). The 3 
participating groups ran the adhoc topics separately on 
each of the 10 subcollections, merged the results, and 
submitted these results, along with a baseline run treat- 
ing the subcollections a a single collection. 
The "confusion" track represents an extension of the 
current asks to deal with corrupted ata such as would 
come from OCR or speech input. This was a new track 
proposed uring the TREC-3 conference. The track fol- 
lowed the adhoc task, but using only the category B 
data. This data was randomly corrupted at NIST using 
character deletions, ubstitutions, and additions to create 
data with a 10% and 20% error rate (i.e., 10% or 20% of 
the characters were affected). Note that this process is 
neutral in that it does not model OCR or speech input. 
Four groups used the baseline and 10% corruption level: 
only two groups tried the 20% level. 
The filtering track represents a variation of the current 
routing track. For several years some participants have 
been concerned about the definition of the routing task. 
and a few groups experimented in TREC-3 with an 
alternative definition of routing. In TREC-4 the track 
was formalized. It used the same topics, training docu- 
ments, and test documents as the routing task. The dif- 
ference was that the results submitted for the filtering 
runs were unranked sets of documents satisfying three 
"utility function" criteria. These criteria were designed 
to approximate a high precision run, a high recall ran, 
and a "balanced" run. For more details on this track see 
the paper "The TREC-4 Filtering Track" by David 
Lewis (in the TREC-4 proceedings). 
3. THE TEST  COLLECT ION (ENGL ISH)  
3.1 Introduction 
Like most traditional retrieval collections, there are 
three distinct parts to this collection -- the documents. 
the questions or topics, and the relevance judgments or 
"right answers." 
3.2 The Documents 
The documents were distributed on CD-ROMs with 
about 1 gigabyte of data on each, compressed to fit. For 
TREC-3 and TREC-4, disks 1, 2 and 3 were all avail- 
able as training material (see Table 3). In TREC-3. 
disks 1 and 2 were also used for the adhoc task, and disk 
3 for the routing task. In TREC-4, disks 2 and 3 were 
used for the adhoc task, and new data (also shown in 
Table 3) was used for the routing task. The following 
shows the actual contents of each of the three CD- 
ROMs (disks 1, 2, and 3).

Table 3 shows some basic document collection statis- 
tics. Although the collection sizes are roughly equiv- 
alent in megabytes, there is a range of document lengths 
across collections, from very short documents (DOE) to 
very long fiR), Also, the range of document lengths 
within a collection varies. For example, the documents 
378 
from the AP are similar in length, but the WSJ, the ZIFF 
and especially the FR documents have much wider 
range of lengths within their collections. 
The documents are uniformly formatted into SGML, 
with a DTD included for each collection to allow easy 
parsing.

3.3 The Topics 
In designing the TREC task, there was a conscious 
decision made to provide "user need" statements rather 
than more traditional queries. Two major issues were 
involved in this decision. First, there was a desire to 
allow a wide range of query construction methods by 
keeping the topic (the need statement) distinct from the 
query (the actual text submitted to the system). The sec- 
ond issue was the ability to increase the amount of 
information available about each topic, in particular to 
include with each topic a clear statement ofwhat criteria 
make a document relevant.

<de f> Definition(s): 
</top> 
Each topic is formatted in the same standard method 
to allow easier automatic construction of queries. 
Besides a beginning and an end marker, each topic has a 
number, a short title, and a one-sentence description. 
There is a narrative section which is aimed at providing 
a complete description of document relevance for the 
assessors. Each topic also has a concepts ection with a 
list of concepts related to the topic. This section is 
designed to provide a mini-knowledgebase bout a topic 
such as a real searcher might possess. Additionally each 
topic can have a definitions ection and/or a factors ec- 
tion. The definition section has one or two of the defini- 
tions critical to a human understanding of the topic. 
The factors ection is included to allow easier automatic 
query building by listing specffic items from the narra- 
tive that constrain the documents hat are relevant. Two 
particular factors were used in the TREC-1/TREC-2 
topics: a time factor (current, before a given date, etc.) 
and a nationality factor (either involving only certain 
countries or excluding certain countries). 
The new (adhoc) topics used in TREC-3 reflect a 
slight change in direction. Whereas the 
TREC-1/TREC-2 topics were designed to mimic a real 
user's need, and were written by people who are actual 
users of a retrieval system, they were intended to repre- 
sent long-standing information eeds for which a user 
might be willing to create elaborate topics. This made 
them more suited to the routing task than to the adhoc 
task, where users are likely to ask much shorter ques- 
tions. The adhoc topics used in TREC-3 (topics 
151-200) are not only much shorter, but also are missing 
the complex structure of the earlier topics. In particular 
the concepts field has been removed because it was felt 
that real adhoc questions would not contain this field, 
and because inclusion of the field discouraged research 
into techniques for expansion of "too short" user need 
expressions. The shorter topics do not create a problem 
for the muting task, as experience in TREC-1 and 2 has 
shown that the use of the training documents allows a 
shorter topic (or no topic at all).

Sample TREC-3 topic 
<num> Number: 168 
<title> Topic: Financing AMTRAK 
<desc> Description: 
A document will address the ngle of the Federal Gov- 
ernment in financing the operation of the National 
Railroad Transportation Corporation (AMTRAK). 
<narr> Narrative: A relevant document must pro- 
vide information on the government's responsibility 
to make AMTRAK an economically viable enti~. It 
could also discuss the privatization of AMTRAK as an 
alternative to continuing overnment subsidies. Doc- 
uments comparing overnment subsidies given to air 
and bus transportation with those provided to 
AMTRAK would also be relevant. 
In addition to being shorter, the new topics were writ- 
ten by the same group of people that did the relevance 
judgments (see next section). Specifically, each of the 
new topics (numbers 151-200) was developed from a 
genuine need for information brought in by the asses- 
sors. Each assessor constructed his/her own topics from 
some initial statements of interest, and performed all the 
relevance assessments on these topics (with a few 
exceptions). 
However, participants in TREC-3 felt that the topics 
were still too long compared with what users normally 
submit o operational retrieval systems. Therefore the 
TREC-4 topics were made even shorter. Only one field 
was used (i.e. there is no title field and no narrative 
field). 
Sample TREC..4 Topic 
<nura> Number: 207 
<desc> What are the prospects of the Quebec sepa- 
ratists achieving independence from the rest of 
Canada? 
Table 4 gives the average number of terms in the title, 
description, arrative, and concept fields (all three fields 
for TREC-1 and TREC-2, no concept field in TREC-3, 
and only a description field in TREC-4). As can be 
seen, the topics are indeed much shorter, particularly in 
going from TREC-3 to TREC-4.

3.4 The Relevance Judgments 
The relevance judgments are of critical importance to 
a test collection. For each topic it is necessary to com- 
pile a list of relevant documents; hopefully as compre- 
hensive a list as possible. All four TRECs have used 
the pooling method \[3\] to assemble the relevance assess- 
ments. In this method a pool of possible relevant docu- 
ments is created by taking a sample of documents 
selected by the various participating systems. This sam- 
pie is then shown to the human assessors. The particu- 
lar sampling method used in TREC is to take the top 
100 documents retrieved in each submitted run for a 
given topic and merge them into the pool for assess- 
ment. This is a valid sampling technique since all the 
systems used ranked retrieval methods, with those docu- 
ments most likely to be relevant returned first. 
A measure of the effect of pooling can be seen by 
examining the overlap of retrieved ocuments. Table 5 
shows the statistics from the merging operations in the 
four TREC conferences. For example, in TREC-1 and 
TREC-2 the top 100 documents from each run (33 runs 
in TREC-1 and 40 runs in TREC-2) could have pro- 
duced a total of 3300 and 4000 documents o be judged 
(for the adhoc task). The average number of documents 
actually judged per topic (those that were unique) was 
1279 (39%) for TREC-1 and 1106 (28%) for TREC-2. 
Note that even though the number of runs has increased 
by more than 20% (adhoc), the number of unique docu- 
ments found has actually dropped. The percentage of 
relevant documents found, however, has not changed 
much. The more accurate results going from TREC-1 to 
TREC-2 mean that fewer nonrelevant documents are 
being found by the systems. This trend continued in 
TREC-3, with a major drop (particularly for the routing 
task) that reflects increased accuracy in rejecting nonrel- 
evant documents. In TREC-4, the trend was reversed. 
In the case of the adhoc task (including most of the 
track runs also), there is a slight increase in the percent- 
age of unique documents found, probably caused by the 
wider variety of expansion terms used by the systems to 
compensate for the lack of a narrative section in the 
topic. A larger percentage increase is seen in the rout- 
ing task, due to fewer runs being pooled, i.e., a higher 
percentage of documents i likely to be unique. Also 
the TREC-4 routing task was more difficult, both 
380  
because of the long Federal Register documents and 
because there was a mismatch of the testing data to the 
training data (for the computer topics). Both these fac- 
tors led to less accurate filtering of nonrelevant docu- 
ments. 
The total number of relevant documents found has 
dropped with each TREC, and that drop has been caused 
by a deliberate tightening of the topics each year to bet- 
ter guarantee completeness of the relevance judgments 
(see below for more details on this).

Table 5: Overlap of Submitted Results 
Evaluation of retrieval results using the assessments 
from this sampfing method is based on the assumption 
that the vast majority of relevant documents have been 
found and that documents hat have not been judged can 
be assumed to be not relevant. A test of this assumption 
was made using TREC-2 results, and again during the 
TREC-3 evaluation. In both cases, a second set of 100 
documents was examined from each system, using only 
a sample of topics and systems in TREC-2, and using all 
topics and systems in TREC-3. 
For the TREC-2 completeness tests, a median of 21 
new relevant documents per topic was found (11% 
increase in total relevant documents). This averages to 
3 new relevant documents found in the second 100 doc- 
uments for each system, and this is a high estimate for 
all systems since the 7 runs sampled for additional judg- 
ments were from the better systems. Similar results 
were found for the more complete TREC-3 testing, with 
a median of 30 new relevant documents per topic for the 
adhoc task, and 13 new ones for the routing task. This 
averages to well less than one new relevant document 
per run, since 48 runs from all systems were used in the 
adhoc test (49 runs in the routing test). These tests 
show that the levels of completeness found during the 
TREC-2 and TREC-3 testing are quite acceptable for 
this type of evaluation. 
The number of new relevant documents found was 
shown to be correlated with the original number of rele- 
vant documents. Table 6 shows the breakdown for the 
50 adhoc topics in TREC-3. The median of 30 new rel- 
evant documents occurs for a topic with 122 original 
relevant documents. Topics with many more relevant 
documents initially tend to have more new ones found, 
and this has led to a greater emphasis on using topics 
with fewer elevant documents.

Table 6: Relationship between completeness and the 
initial number of relevant documents 
In addition to the completeness i ue, relevance judg- 
ments need to be checked for consistency. In each of 
the TREC evaluations, each topic was judged by a sin- 
gle assessor to ensure the best consistency of judgment. 
Some testing of this consistency was done after 
TREC-2, when a sample of the topics and documents 
was rejudged by a second assessor. The results howed 
an average agreement between the two judges of about 
80%. In TREC-4 all the adhoc topics had samples 
re judged by two additional assessors, with the results 
being about 72% agreement among all three judges, and 
88% agreement between the initial judge and either one 
of the two additional judges. This is a remarkably high 
level of agreement in relevance assessment, and proba- 
bly is due to the general lack of ambiguity in the topics. 
4. EVALUATION 
An important component of TREC was to provide a 
common evaluation fonun. Standard recall/precision 
figures have been calculated for each TREC system, 
along with some single-value evaluation measures. New 
for TREC-3 was a histogram for each system showing 
performance on each topic. In general, more emphasis 
has been placed on a "per topic analysis' in an effort to 
get beyond the problems of averaging across topics.

Work has been done, however, to find statistical differ- 
ences among the systems (see paper "A Statistical Anal- 
ysis of the TREC-3 Data" by Jean Tague-Sutcliffe and 
James Blustein in the TREC-3 proceedings.) Addition- 
ally charts have been published in the proceedings that 
consolidate information provided by the systems 
describing features and system timing, and allowing 
some primitive comparison of the amount of effort 
needed to produce the results. 
4.1 Definition of Recall/Precision 
Figure 2 shows typical recall/precision curves. The x 
axis plots the recall values at fixed levels of recall, 
where 
Recall = 
number of  relevant items retrieved 
total number of  relevant items in collection 
The y axis plots the average precision values at those 
given recall values, where precision is calculated by 
Precision = 
number of relevant items retrieved 
total number of items retrieved 
These curves represent averages over the 50 topics. 
The averaging method was developed many years ago 
\[4\] and is well accepted by the infomaation retrieval 
community. The curves show system performance 
across the full range of retrieval, i.e., at the early stage 
of retrieval where the highly-ranked ocuments give 
high accuracy or precision, and at the final stage of 
retrieval where there is usually a low accuracy, but more 
complete retrieval. The use of these curves assumes a
ranked output from a system. Systems that provide an 
unranked set of documents are known to be less effec- 
tive and therefore were not tested in the TREC program. 
The curves in figure 2 show that system A has a much 
higher precision at the low recall end of the graph and 
therefore is more accurate. System B however has 
higher precision at the high recall end of the curve and 
therefore will give a more complete set of relevant docu- 
ments, assuming that the user is willing to look further 
in the ranked list. 
4.2 Single-Value Evaluation Measures 
In addition to recall/precision curves, there are 2 sin- 
gle-value measures used in TREC. 
The first measure, the non-interpolated average preci- 
sion, corresponds to the area under an ideal (non- 
interpolated) recall/precision curve. To compute this 
average, a precision average for each topic is first calcu- 
lated. This is done by computing the precision after 
every retrieved relevant document and then averaging 
382 
these precisions over the total number of retrieved rele- 
vant documents for that opic. These topic averages are 
then combined (averaged) across all topics in the appro- 
priate set to create the non-interpolated average preci- 
sion for that set. 
The second measure used is an average of the preci- 
sion for each topic after I00 documents have been 
retrieved for that topic. This measure isuseful because 
it reflects a clearly comprehended retrieval point. It 
took on added importance in the TREC environment 
because only the top 100 documents retrieved for each 
topic were actually assessed. For this reason it produces 
a guaranteed valuation point for each system. 
5. RESULTS 
5.1 Introduction 
One of the important goals of the TREC conferences 
is that the participating roups freely devise their own 
experiments within the TREC task. For some groups 
this means doing the routing and/or adhoc task with the 
goal of achieving high retrieval effectiveness perfor- 
mance. For other groups, however, the goals are more 
diverse and may mean experiments in efficiency, 
unusual ways of using the data, or experiments in how 
"users" would view the TREC paradigm. 
The overview of the results discusses the effec- 
tiveness of the systems and analyzes ome of the simi- 
larities and differences in the approaches that were 
taken. It points to some of the other experiments run in 
TREC-3 where results cannot be measured completely 
using recall/precision measures, and discusses the tracks 
in TREC-4. 
In all cases, readers are referred to the system papers 
in the TREC-3 and TREC-4 proceedings for more 
details. 
5.2 TREC-3 Adhoc Results 
The TREC-3 adhoc evaluation used new topics (top- 
ics 151-200) against wo disks of training documents 
(disks 1 and 2). A dominant feature of the adhoc task in 
TREC-3 was the removal of the concepts field in the 
topics (see more on this in the discussion of the topics, 
section 3.3) Many of the participating groups designed 
their experiments around techniques to expand the 
shorter and less "rich" topics. 
There were 48 sets of results for adhoc evaluation i  
TREC-3, with 42 of them based on runs for the full data 
set. Of these, 28 used automatic construction fqueries, 
12 used manual construction, and 2 used interactive 
construction. 
Figure 3 shows the recall/precision curves for the 6 
TREC-3 groups with the highest non-interpolated aver- 
age precision using automatic onstruction of queries. 
The runs are ranked by the average precision and only 
one run is shown per group (both official Cornell runs 
would have qualified for this set). 
A short summary of the techniques used in these runs 
shows the breadth of the approaches. For more details 
on the various runs and procedures, please see the cited 
paper in the TREC-3 proceedings. 
cityal -- City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-3" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, S. Jones, M.M. Hancock- 
Beaulieu and M. Gatford) used a probabilistic term 
weighting scheme similar to that used in TREC-2, but 
expanded the topics by up to 40 terms (average around 
20) automatically selected from the top 30 documents 
retrieved. They also used dynamic passage retrieval in 
addition to the whole document retrieval in their final 
ranking. 
1NQ101 -- University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Document Retrieval and Routing Using the 
INQUERY System" by John Broglio, James P. Callan, 
W. Brace Croft and Daniel W. Nachbar) used a version 
ofprobabilistic weighting that allows easy combining of 
evidence (an inference net). Their basic term weighting 
formula (and query processing) was simplified from that 
used in TREC-2, and they also used passage retrieval 
and whole document information in their ranking. The 
topics were expanded by 30 phrases that were automati- 
caUy selected from a phrase "thesaurus" that had been 
previously built automatically from the entire corpus of 
documents. 
CrnlEA -- ComeU University ("Automatic Query 
Expansion Using SMART: TREC-3 by Chris Buckley, 
Gerard Salton, James Allan and Amit Singhal) used the 
vector-space SMART system, with term weighting simi- 
lar to that done in TREC-2. The top 30 documents were 
used in a Rocchio relevance f edback technique to mas- 
sively expand (500 terms + 10 phrases) the topics. No 
passage retrieval was done in this run; the second Cor- 
nell run (CrnlLA) used their local/global weighting 
schemes (with no topic expansion). 
westpl -- West Publishing Company ("TREC-3 Ad Hoc 
Retrieval and Routing Experiments using the WIN Sys- 
tem" by Paul Thompson, Howard Turtle, Bokyung Yang 
and James Flood) used their commercial product (WIN) 
which is based on the same inference method used in 
1NQIO1. Both passages and whole documents were

used in document ranking, but only minimal topic 
expansion was used, with that expansion based on pre- 
constructed general-purpose synonym classes for abbre- 
viations and other exact synonyms. 
pircsl - Queens College, CUNY ("TREC-3 Ad-Hoc, 
Routing Retrieval and Thresholding Experiments using 
PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok, L. Grunfeld and D.D. Lewis) 
used a spreading activation model on subdocuments 
(550-word chunks). Topic expansion was done by 
allowing activation from the top 6 documents in addi- 
tion to the terms in the original topic. The highest 30 
terms were chosen, with an average of 11 of those not in 
the original topic. 
ETHO02 -- Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) 
("Improving a Basic Retrieval Method by Links and 
Passage Level Evidence" by Daniel Knaus, Elke Mitten- 
dorf and Peter Schauble) used a completely new method 
in TREC-3 based on combining information from three 
very different retrieval techniques. The three techniques 
are a vector-space system, a passage retrieval method 
using a Hidden Markov model, and a "topic expansion" 
method based on document links generated automati- 
caUy from analysis of common phrases. 
The dominant new themes in the automatic adhoc 
runs are the use of some type of term expansion beyond 
the terms contained in the "less rich" (TREC-3) topics, 
and some form of passage or subdocument retrieval ele- 
ment. Note that term expansion is mostly a recall 
device; adding new terms to a topic increases the 
chances of matching the wide variation of terms usually 
found in relevant documents. But adding terms also 
increases the "noise" factor, so accuracy may need to be 
improved via a precision device, and hence the use of 
passages, ubdocuments, or more local weighting. 
Two main types of term expansion were used by these 
top groups: term expansion based on a pre-constructed 
thesaurus (for example the INQUERY PhraseFinder) 
and term expansion based on selected terms from the 
top X documents (as done by City, ComeU, and PIRCS). 
Both techniques worked well. The top 3 runs (cityal, 
1NQI01, and CrnlEA) have excellent performance (see 
Figure 3) in the "middle" recall range (30 to 80%), with 
this performance likely coming from the query expan- 
sion. 
The use of the top 30 documents as a source of terms, 
as opposed to using the entire corpus, should be sensi- 
tive to the quality of the documents in this initial set. 
Notably, for 6 of the 8 topics in which the INQI01 run 
was superior (a 20% or more improvement in average 
precision) to the cityal run, the 1NQ101 run was also 
superior to the CrnlEA run. These topics tended to have

for Passage Retrieval and Topic Expansion 
fewer relevant documents, but also tended to be topics 
for which the systems bringing terms in manually (such 
as by manually selecting from a thesaurus or outside 
sources) also did well. 
Another factor in topic expansion is the number of 
terms being added to the topics. The average number of 
terms in the queries is widely varied, with the City 
group averaging around 50 terms (20 terms from expan- 
sion), the INQUERY system using around 100 terms on 
average, and the Comell system using 550 terms on 
average. This huge variation seemed to have little effect 
on results, largely because ach group found the level of 
topic expansion appropriate for their retrieval tech- 
niques. The cityal run tended to "miss" more relevant 
documents han the CrnlEA run (7 topics were seriously 
hurt by this problem), but was better able to rank rele- 
vant documents within the 1000 document cutoff so that 
more relevant documents appeared in the top 100 docu- 
ments. This better ranking could have happened 
because of the many fewer terms that were used, or 
could be caused by the use of passage retrieval in the 
City run. 
The use of passages or subdocuments to reduce the 
noise effect of large documents has been used for sev- 
eral years in the PIRCS system. City, INQUERY and 
Cornell all did many experiments for TREC-3 to first 
determine the correct length of a passage, and then to 
find the appropriate use of passages in their ranking 
schemes. INQUERY and Cornell use overlapped pas- 
sages of fixed length (200 words) as compared to City's 
non-overlapped passages of 4 to 30 paragraphs in 
length. All three systems use information from pas- 
sages and whole documents retrieved rather than pas- 
sage retrieval alone. (Cornell's version of this is called 
local/global weighting.) Both INQUERY and City com- 
bined the passage retrieval with query expansion; Cor- 
nell did two separate runs. 
The westpl run did not use topic expansion, although 
a rrfixture of passages and whole documents was used in 
the final ranking of documents. The performance has 
suffered for this in the middle recall range. West Pub- 
lishing used their production system to see how far it 
differed from the research systems and therefore did not 
want to use more radical topic expansion methods. 
Additionally they used a shortened topic (title + descrip- 
tion + first sentence of narrative) because it was more 
similar in length to the topics submitted by their users. 
The INQI01 run had 18 topics with superior perfor- 
mance to the westpl run, mostly because of new rele- 
vant documents being retrieved to the top 1000 docu- 
ment set. The westpl nan was superior to the INQIO1 
run for l I topics, mostly caused by better anking for 
those topics. 
The pircsl system used both passage retrieval (sub- 
documents) and topic expansion. This system used far 
fewer top documents for expansion (the top 6 as 
opposed to the top 30), and this may have hurt perfor- 
mance. There were 22 topics in which the INQIO1 run 
was superior to the pircs2 nan, and these were mostly 
because of missed relevant documents. Even though 
both systems added about he same number of expan- 
sion terms, using only the top 6 documents as a source 
of terms for spreading activation might have provided 
too much focussing of the concepts. 
The ETHO01 run used both topic expansion and pas- 
sages, in addition to a baseline vector-space system. 
Both the topic expansion and the passage determination 
were completely new (untried) techniques; additionally 
there are known difficulties in combining multiple meth- 
ods. In comparison to the ComeU expansion results 
(CrnlEA), the main problems appear to be missed rele- 
vant documents for all 17 of the topics where the Cor- 
nell results were superior. The ETH results were supe- 
rior for 8 topics, mostly because of better ranking. 
Clearly this is a very promising approach and more 
experimentation s eeded. 
Table 7 shows a breakdown of improvements from 
expansion and passage retrieval that combines informa- 
tion from the non-official runs given in the individual 
papers. In general groups eem to be getting about 20% 
improvement over their own baselines (less for ETH and 
PIRCS), with that improvement coming in different per- 
centages from passage retrieval or expansion, depending 
on the specific retrieval techniques being used.

Figure 4 shows the recall/precision curves for the 6

INQI02  -- University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
This run is a manual modification of the INQIO1 run, 
with strict rules for the modifications to only allow 
removal of words and phrases, modification of weights, 
and addition of proximity restrictions. 
Brkly7 - University of California, Berkeley ("Experi- 
ments in the Probabilistic Retrieval of Full Text Docu- 
ments" by William S. Cooper, Aitao Chert and Fredric 
C. Gey) is a modification of the Brkly6 run, with that 
modification being the manual expansion of the queries 
by adding synonyms found from other sources. The 
Brkly6 run uses a logistic regression model to combine 
information from 6 measures of document relevancy 
based on term matches and term distribution. The coef- 
ficients were learned from the training data in a manner 
similar to that done in TREC-2, but the specific set of 
measures used has been expanded and modified for 
TREC-3. No passage retrieval was done. 
ASSCTV1 - Mead Data Central, Inc ("Query Expan- 
sion/Reduction and its Impact on Retrieval Effec- 
tiveness" by X. Allan Lu and Robert B Keefer) is also a 
manual expansion of queries using an associative the- 
saurus built from the TREC data. The retrieval system 
used in ASSCTV1 is the SMART system. 
VTc2s2 -- Virginia Tech ("Combination of Multiple 
Searches" by Joseph A. Shaw and Edward A. Fox) used 
a combination of multiple types of queries, with 2 types 
of natural language vector-space queries and 3 types of 
manually constructed P-Norm (soft Boolean) queries. 
pircs2 - Queens College, CUNY. This run is a modifi- 
cation of the base PIRCS system to use manually con- 
structed soR Boolean queries. 
rutfuaI - Rutgers University ("Decision Level Data 
Fusion for Routing of Documents in the TREC3 Con- 
text: A Best Cases Analysis of Worst Case Results" by 
Paul B. Kantor) used data fusion methods to combine 
the retrieval ranks from three different retrieval schemes 
all using the INQUERY system. Two of the schemes 
used Boolean queries (one with ranking and one with- 
out) and the third used the same queries without opera- 
tots. 
The three dominant themes in the runs using 
386 
manually constructed queries are manual modification 
of automatically generated queries (INQI02), manual 
expansion of queries (Brkly7 and ASSCTV1) and com- 
bining of multiple retrieval techniques or queries. Three 
runs can be compared to a "baseline" run to check the 
effects of manual versus automatic query construction. 
INQi02, the manually modified version of 1NQ101, 
had a 15% improvement in average precision over 
INQi01, and 17 topics that were superior in perfor- 
mance for the manual system (as opposed to only 3 for 
the automatic system). An analysis of those topics 
shows that many more relevant documents were in the 
top 1000 documents and the top 100 documents, proba- 
bly caused by manually eliminating much of the noise 
that was producing higher ranks for nonrelevant docu- 
ments. This noise elimination could have happened 
because many spurious terms had been manually 
removed from the queries (INQI02 had an average of 
about 30 terms as opposed to nearly 100 terms in 
1NQI01), or could have come from the use of the prox- 
imity operators. 
The Brkly7 run, a manually expanded version of 
Brkly6, used about the same number of terms as the 
INQI02 run (around 36 terms on average), but the terms 
had been manually pulled from multiple sources (as 
opposed to editing an automatic expansion as done by 
INQUERY). The improvement from Brkly6 to Brkly7 is 
a 34% gain in average precision, with 25 topics having 
superior performance in the manually expanded run. 
Note however that there was no topic expansion done in 
the automatic Brkly6 run, so this improvement repre- 
sents the results of a good manual topic expansion over 
no expansion at all. 
The INQUERY system outperforms the Berkeley sys- 
tem by 14% in average precision, with much of that dif- 
ference coming in the high recall end of the graph (see 
Figure 4). This is consistent with the difference in their 
topic expansion techniques in that the automatic expan- 
sion (even manually edited) is likely to bring in terms 
that users might not select from "non-focussed" sources. 
The ASSCTV1 nan also represents a manual expansion 
effort, but using a pre-built thesaurus as opposed to 
using textual sources for the expansion. The topics 
were expanded to create a query averaging around 135 
terms and then were run using the default Cornell 
SMART system. A comparison of the automatically 
expanded CrnlEA run and the manually expanded ASS- 
CTVI run shows minimal difference in average preci- 
sion, but superior performance in 18 of the topics for the 
manual expansion (as opposed to only 10 of the topics 
having superior performance for the automatic Cornell 
run). In both cases, the improvements come from 
finding more relevant documents because of the expan- 
sions, but different expansion methods help different 
topics. 
The pircs2 run is a manual query version of the base- 
line PIRCS system. A soft Boolean query is created 
from the topic, but no topic expansion is done. There is 
minimal difference in average precision between the two 
PIRCS runs, but more topics show superior performance 
for the soft Boolean query pircs2 run (8 superior topics 
versus 4 superior topics for the topic expansion pircsl 
run). It is not clear whether this difference comes from 
the increased precision of the soft Boolean approach or 
from the relatively poor performance ofthe PIRCS term 
expansion results. 
In TREC-3, as opposed to TRECs 1 and 2, the man- 
ual query construction methods perform better than their 
automatic ounterparts. The removal of some of the 
topic structure (the concepts) has allowed ifferences to 
appear that could not be seen in earlier TRECs. Since 
topic expansion was necessary to produce top scores, 
the superiority of the manual expansion over no expan- 
sion in the Berkeley runs should not be surprising. Less 
clear is why the manual modifications in the INQI02 
run showed superior performance to the automatic nan 
with no modifications. The likely explanation is that the 
automatic term expansion methods are relatively uncon- 
trolled in TREC-3 and manual intervention plays an 
important role. 
The last two groups in the top six systems using man- 
ual query construction used some form of combination 
of retrieval techniques. The Virginia Tech group 
(VTc2s2) combined the results of up to 5 different types 
of query constraction (3 P-Norms with different P val- 
ues and 2 vector-space, one short and one manually 
expanded) to create their results. They used a simple 
combination method (adding all the similarity values) 
and tested various combinations of query types. Their 
best result combined only two of the query types, one a 
P-Norm and one a vector-space. A series of additional 
runs (see paper for details) confirmed that the best 
method was to combine the results of the best two query 
techniques (the "long" vector-space and the P=2 P- 
Norm). They concluded that improvements from com- 
bining results only occurred when the input techniques 
were sufficiently different. 
Although the Rutgers group (rutfual) used more 
elaborate combining techniques, they came to the same 
conclusion. Combining different retrieval techniques 
offers improvements over a single technique (over 30% 
for the Virginia Tech group), but the input techniques 
need to be more varied to get further improvements. 
But the more varied the individual techniques, the more

need for elaborate combining methods uch as used in 
the rutfual run. The automatic ETHO01 run best exem- 
pli.fies the direction needed here; first getting "good" 
performance for three very different but complementary 
techniques and then discovering the best ways of com- 
bining results. 
Several comments should be made with respect to the 
overall adhoc recall/precision averages. First, the better 
results are very similar and it is unlikely that there is any 
statistical difference between them. The Scheffe" tests 
run by Jean Tague-Sutcliffe (see paper "A Statistical 
Analysis of the TREC-3 Data" by Jean Tague-Sutcliffe 
and James Blustein in the TREC-3 proceedings) how 
that the top 20 category A runs (manual and automatic 
mixed) are all statistically equivalent at the a=0.05 
level. This lack of system differentiation comes from 
the very wide performance variation across topics (the 
cross-topic variance is much greater than the cross- 
system variance) and points to the need for more 
research into how to statistically characterize the TREC 
results. 
As a second point, it should be noted that these adhoc 
results represent significant improvements over 
TREC-2. Figure 5 shows the top three systems in 
TREC-3 and the top three systems in TREC-2. This 
improvement was unexpected as the removal of the 
concepts ection seemed likely to cause a considerable 
performance drop (up to 30% was predicted). Instead 
the advance of topic expansion techniques caused major 
improvements in performance with less "user" input (the 
concepts). Because of the different sets of topics 
involved, the exact amount of improvement cannot be 
computed. However the CorneU group has run older 
systems (those used in TREC-1 and TREC-2) against 
the TREC-3 topics. This shows an improvement of20% 
for their expansion run (CrnlEA) over the TREC-2 sys- 
tem, and this is likely to be typical for many of the sys- 
terns this year. 
5.3 TREC-4 Adhoe Results 
The TREC-4 adhoc evaluation used new topics (top- 
ics 201-250) against wo disks of training documents 
(disks 2 and 3). A dominant feature of the adhoc task in 
TREC-4 was the much shorter topics (see more on this 
in the discussion of the topics, section 3.3). Many 
groups tried their automatic query expansion methods 
on the shorter topics (with good success); other groups 
also did manual query construction experiments o con- 
trast hese methods for the very short opics. 
There were 39 sets of results for adhoc evaluation in 
TREC-4, with 33 of them based on runs for the full data 
set. Of these, 14 used automatic construction of queries,

and 19 used manual construction. All of the category B 
groups used automatic construction fthe queries. 
Figure 6 shows the recall/precision curves for the 6 
TREC-4 groups with the highest non-interpolated aver- 
age precision using automatic onstruction of queries. 
The runs are ranked by the average precision and only 
one run is shown per group (both official Cornell runs 
would have qualified for this set). 
A short summary of the techniques used in these runs 
shows the breadth of the approaches and the changes in 
approach from TREC-3. For more details on the various 
runs and procedures, please see the cited papers in the 
TREC-4 proceedings. 
Crn lEA  --  Comell University ("New Retrieval 
Approaches Using SMART: TREC-4" by Chris Buck- 
ley, Amit Singhal, Mandar Mitra, (Gerald Salton)) used 
the SMART system, but with a non-cosine length nor- 
realization method. The top 20 documents were used to 
locate 50 terms and 10 phrases for expansion, as con- 
trasted with using the top 30 documents o massively 
expand (500 terms + 10 phrases) the topics as in 
TREC-3. This change in expansion techniques was 
mostly due to the major change in the basic algorithm. 
However, additional care was taken not to overexpand 
the very short topics. Work has continued at Comell in 
improving their radical new matching algorithm, and 
further information can be found in \[5\]. 
p i rcs l  -- Queens College, CUNY ("TREC-4 Ad-Hoc, 
Routing Retrieval and Filtering Experiments using 
PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok and L. Gmnfeld) used a spread- 
ing activation model on subdocuments (550-word 
chunks). It was expected that this type of model would 
be particularly affected by the shorter topics, and experi- 
ments were run trying several methods of topic expan- 
sion. For this automatic run, expansion was done by 
selecting 50 terms from the top 40 subdocuments in 
addition to the terms in the original topic. Several other 
experiments were made using manual modifica- 
tions/expansions of the topics and these are reported 
with the manual adhoc results. The experiments with 
short topics has continued and further esults can be 
seen in \[6\]. 
c i tya l  --  City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-4" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, M.M. Beaulieu, M. Gat- 
ford and A, Payne") used a probabilistic term weighting 
scheme similar to that used in TREC-3. An average of 
20 terms were automatically selected from the top 50 
documents retrieved (only initial and final passages of 
these documents were used for term selection). The use 
of passages seemed to have httle effect. This run was a 
389 
base run for theft experiments in manual query editing. 
INQ201 -- University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Recent Experiments with INQUERY" by James Allan, 
Lisa Bellesteros, James P. Callan, W. Bruce Croft and 
Zhihong Lu) used a version of probabilistic weighting 
that allows easy combining of evidence (an inference 
net). Their basic term weighting formula underwent a 
major change between TREC-3 and TREC-4 that com- 
bined the TREC-3 INQUERY weighting with the 
OKAPI (City University) weighting. They also used 
passage retrieval as in TREC-3, but found it detrimental 
in TREC-4. The topics were expanded by 30 phrases 
that were automatically selected from a phrase "the- 
saurus" (InFinder) that had previously been built auto- 
matically from the entire corpus of documents. Expan- 
sion did not work as well as in TREC-3, and additional 
work comparing the use of InFinder and the use of the 
top documents for expansion is reported in \[7\]. 
s iems l  -- Siemens Corporate Research ("Siemens 
TREC-4 Report: Further Experiments with Database 
Merging" by Ellen M. Voorhees) used the SMART 
retrieval strategies from TREC-3 in this run (their base 
run for the database merging track). The standard vec- 
tor normalization was used, and query expansion was 
done using the Rocchio method to select up to 100 
terms and 10 phrases from the top 15 documents 
retrieved. 
citr i2 -- RMIT, Australia ("Similarity Measures for 
Short Queries" by Ross Wilkinson, Justin Zobel, and 
Ron Sacks-Davis) was the result of a series of investiga- 
tions into similarity measures. The best of these mea- 
sures combined the standard cosine measure with the 
OKAPI measure. No topic expansion was done for this 
run .  
It is interesting to note that many of the systems did 
critical work on their term weighting/similarity mea- 
sures between TREC-3 and TREC-4. Three of the top 6 
runs were results of major revisions in the basic ranking 
algorithms, revisions that were the outcome of extensive 
analysis work on previous TREC results. At Cornell 
they investigated the problems with using a cosine nor- 
realization on the long documents inTREC. This inves- 
tigation resulted in a completely new term weight- 
ing/similarity strategy that performs well for all lengths 
of documents. The University of Massachusetts exam- 
ined the issue of dealing with terms having a high fie- 
quency in documents (which is also related to document 
length). The result of their investigation was a term 
weighting algorithm that combined the OKAPI algo- 
rithm (City University) for high frequency terms with 
the old INQUERY algorithm for lower frequency terms. 
The work at RMIT (the citri2 run) was part on their 
ongoing effort o test various term weighting schemes. 
These experiments in more sophisticated term 
weighting and matching algorithms are yet another step 
in the adaptation of retrieval systems to a full-text envi- 
ronment. The issues of long documents, with their 
higher frequency terms, mean that the algorithms origi- 
nally built for abstract-length documents need rethink- 
ing. This did not happen in earlier TRECs because the 
problem seemed less important than, for example, dis- 
coveting automatic query expansion methods in 
TREC-3. 
The dominant new feature in TREC-4 was the very 
short topics. These topics were much shorter than any 
previous TREC topics (an average reduction from 107 
terms in TREC-3 to 16 terms in TREC-4). In general 
the participating roups took two approaches: 1) they 
used roughly the same techniques that they would have 
on the longer topics, and 2) most of them tried some 
investigative manual experiments. Of the 6 runs shown 
in Figure 6, two runs ( INQ201 and c i tya l )  used a simi- 
lar number and source of expansion terms as for the 
longer queries. The SMART group (Crn/AE) used 
many fewer terms because of their new algorithms. The 
p i rcs l  run was a result of more expansion, but this was 
due to corrections of problems in TREC-3 as opposed to 
changes needed for the shorter topics. The run from 
Siemens i ems l  was made as a baseline for database 
merging, and therefore had less expansion. There was 
no expansion i  the cirri21 run. 
Figure 7 shows the comparison of results between 
TREC-3 and TREC-4 for 4 of the groups that did well 
in each evaluation. As expected, all groups had worse 
performance. The performance for City University, 
where similar algorithms were used in TREC-3 and 
TREC-4, dropped by 36%. A similar drop (34%) was 
true for the INQUERY results, even though the new 
algorithm resulted an almost 5% improvement in results 
(for the TREC-4 topics). Whereas the CorneU results 
represented a major improvement in performance over 
the TREC-3 algorithms, their overall performance 
dropped by 14%. 
This points to several issues that need further investi- 
gation in TREC-5. First, experiments must still con- 
tinue on the shorter topics, since this represents he typi- 
cal initial input query. The results from the shorter top- 
ics may be so poor that the top documents provide mis- 
leading expansion terms. This was a major concern in 
TREC-3 and analysis of this issue is clearly needed. 
The fact that passage retrieval, which provided substan- 
tial improvement of results in TREC-3, did not help

with the shorter TREC-4 topics indicates that other 
types of "noise" control may be needed for short topics. 
It may be that the statistical "clues" presented by these 
shorter topics are simply not enough to provide good 
retrieval performance and that better human-aided sys- 
terns need to be tested. 
However, the manual systems also suffered major 
drops in performance (see Figure 8). This leads to a 
second issue, i.e. a need for further investigation i to the 
causes of the generally poorer performance in the 
TREC-4 adhoe task. It may be that he narrative section 
of the topic is necessary to make the intent of the user 
clear to both the manual query builder and the automatic 
systems. The fact that machine performance mirrored 
human performance in TREC-4 makes the decrease in 
automatic system performance more acceptable, but still 
requires further analysis into why both types of query 
construction were so affected by the very short opics. 
Figure 9 shows the recall/precision curves for the 6 
TREC-4 groups with the highest non-interpolated aver- 
age precision using manual construction of queries. A 
short summary of the techniques used in these runs fol- 
lows. Again, for more details on the various runs and 
procedures, see the cited papers in the TREC-4 proceed- 
ings. 
CnQst2 -- Excalibur Corporation ("The Excalibur 
TREC-4 System, Preparations and Results" by Paul E. 
Nelson) used manually built queries. This system uses a 
two-level searching scheme in which the documents are 
first ranked via coarse-grain methods, and then the 
resulting subset is further efined. There are thesaurus 
tools available for expansion, and this run was the result 
of many experiments into such issues as term groupings 
and assignment ofterm strengths. 
pircs2 -- Queens College, CUNY ("TREC-4 Ad-Hoc, 
Routing Retrieval and Filtering Experiments using 
PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok and L. Grunfeld) is a manual 
modification of the automatic queries in pircsl. The 
modification was to replicate words (this increases the 
weight) and to add a few associated words (an average 
of 1.73 words per query or at most 3 content words). 
The simple replication of words led to a 12% increase in 
performance; adding the associated words (the pircs2 
run) upped this increase to 30% improvement over the 
initial automatic query. 
uwgcll -- University of Waterloo ("Shortest Substring 
Ranking (MultiText Experiments for TREC-4)" by 
Charles L.A. Clarke, Gordon V. Cormack, and Forbes J. 
Burkowski) used queries that were manually built in a 
special query language called CGCL. This query 
392 
language uses Boolean operators and proximity con- 
straints to create intervals of text that satisfy specific 
conditions. The ranking algorithms rely on combining 
the results of increasing less restrictive queries until the 
1000 document list is created. 
1NQ202 -- University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Recent Experiments with INQUERY" by James Allan, 
Lisa Bellesteros, James P. Callan, W. Bruce Croft and 
Zhihong Lu) This run is a manual modification of the 
1NQ201 run, with strict rules for the modifications that 
only allow removal of words and phrases, modification 
of weights, and addition of proximity restrictions. This 
type of manual modification i creased overall average 
precision by 21%. The same types of modification 
gained only 15.5% in TREC-3. 
CLARTF-  CLARITECH Corporation ("CLAR/T 
TREC-4 Experiments" by David A. Evans, Natasa 
Mflic-Frayling, and Robert G. Lefferts). used the 
CLARIT system in a machine-aided manual query con- 
struction process. The initial query terms were manu- 
ally modified and weighted, and then terms were manu- 
ally selected for addition to the query based on an auto-. 
matic thesaurus extraction process. This particular run 
used a manually-built "required terms filter" to locate 
the best document windows for use in the thesaurus 
extraction process. 
Brklyl 0 -- University of California, Berkeley ("Logistic 
Regression at TREC4: Probabilistic Retrieval from Full 
Text Document Collections" by Fredric C. Gey, Aitao 
Chen, Jianzhang He and Jason Meggs) uses manually- 
reformulated queries including expansion using the 
News database of the MELVYL electronic atalog to 
either add specific instances or synonyms and related 
terms. The basic retrieval system is a logistic regression 
model that combines information from 6 measures of 
document relevancy based on term matches and term 
distribution. The coefficients were learned from the 
training data. 
These 6 runs (and most of the other manual runs) can 
be divided into three different styles of manual query 
construction. The first group uses an automatic query 
construction method as a starting point, and then manu- 
ally modifies the results. The INQ202 run is a good 
example of this, where words and phrases were 
removed, term weights were modified, and proximity 
restrictions were added to the initial automatic query. 
The pircs2 results were based on reweighting of the 
automatically-generated terms and then adding a few 
new terms. The cityml (not shown) results were based 
on pre-editing the automatically-generated query, and 
then post-editing the automatic expansion of that query. 
The results of these manual modifications were 
highly varied. The manual edits performed by City Uni- 
versity were only marginally effective. Manual modifi- 
cation of term weights eemed to have more impact, as 
is illustrated by the 12% improvement in the pircs2 run, 
and also by some unknown percentage ofthe INQUERY 
manual results. However the addition of a few expan- 
sion terms in the pircs2 run, or the use of proximity 
restrictions (INQ202) look to be the most promising 
manual modifications. Note that several of the runs in 
this top 6 make heavy use of some type of proximity 
restrictions. The ConQuest group found major 
improvements from term grouping, and the Multitext 
system from the University of Waterloo relies on prox- 
imity restrictions for their results. Since proximity 
restrictions are related to the use of phrases (either sta- 
tistical or syntactic) or the use of additional local infor- 
mation, this area is clearly a focus for further esearch. 
The second group, exemplified by uwgcll and 
BrklylO, used queries completely manually generated 
using some type of auxiliary information resource such 
as online dictionaries (uwgcll) or news databases 
(BrklylO). The query generated for uwgcH uses 
Boolean-type restrictors, whereas the query generated 
for BrklylO uses natural language. 
The third type of manual query construction i volves 
a more complex type of human-machine interaction. 
Both the CnQst2 run and the CLARTF run are results of 
experiments examining a multi-stage process of query 
construction. The ConQuest group starts with a manual 
query, and then expands this query semi-automatically 
by manually choosing the correct senses of terms to 
expand. Then they manually modify the term weights 
and term grouping. The CLARITECH group manually 
modifies queries that are automatically generated, and 
then provides various levels of user control of an auto- 
matic expansion process (see the CLARITECH paper 
for several experiments involving this user control). 
Note that hese three styles of manual query construc- 
tion require various levels of user effort and training. 
Simple edits of automatic queries, user term weighting, 
and (less likely) proximity restrictions can be done by a 
relatively untrained user. The performance of these 
users is not apt to be as good as the 1NQ202 or pircs2 
results, however, since both of these runs were the 
results of the primary system developers functioning as 
users .  
The complete manual generation of queries (such as 
the uwgcll or BrklylO efforts) require the types of skills 
currently seen in search intermediaries. Using specific 
query languages takes lots of training, and learning to 
find reasonable t rms to expand topics is an art acquired

only after lots of practice. This should be contrasted 
with the third type of query construction. The complex 
interaction with the user exemplified by the CnQst2 and 
CLARTF runs requires a different ype (and possibly 
level) of skills and training. These systems are a com- 
pletely new model of search engine, and it will be nec- 
essary to develop different skills and new "mental mod- 
els" in order that users can become proficient in search- 
ing. 
The amount of effort and training required to achieve 
these improvements in automatic results hould not pre- 
clude using these techniques. Indeed the major 
improvements shown by these methods illustrate the 
importance of continuing investigation into the best 
places for human intervention. Furthermore, studies 
have shown that users feel a need for more control of 
their searching and this control is absent from current 
automatic systems. 
5.4 TREC-3 Routing Results 
The routing evaluation used a subset of the training 
topics (topics 101-150 were used) against he disk of 
test d~urnents (disk 3). Although this disk had been 
used in TREC-2, its use in TREC-3 was unexpected as 
new data had been promised. The last minute unavail- 
ability of this new data made the reuse of disk 3 
necessary, but since groups had not been training with 
this disk (and no relevance judgments were available for 
this disk against topics 101-150), the routing results 
should not be biased by the reuse of old material. 
The routing task in TREC has remained constant; 
however there has been a major evolution in the ttirust 
of the research for this task. There was minimal training 
data for TREC-1, and most groups felt that their results 
were even more preliminary than for the adhoc results 
because the training data that was available was incom- 
plete and inconsistent. This means that routing became 
a particularly interesting challenge in TREC-2 when 
adequate training data (the results from TREC-1 adhoc 
topics) became available. 
The TREC-2 results therefore represent an excellent 
baseline of what could be achieved using traditional 
algorithms with large amounts of relevance information. 
Most notable was the effective use of the Rocchio feed- 
back algorithm in SMART, where up to 500 new terms 
were added to the routing topics from the training data. 
Equally good results were achieved by a probabilistic 
system from the University of Dortmund, where only 30 
terms were added, but very precise term weighting was 
learned from the training data. Manual construction of 
queries consistently gave poorer performance as the 
availability of training data allowed an automatic tuning 
394 
of the queries that would be difficult to duplicate manu- 
ally without extensive analysis. 
For TREC-3, many groups made only minor modifi- 
cations to their TREC-2 techniques (and concentrated 
on the adhoc task). There were a total of 49 sets of 
results for routing evaluation, with 46 of them based on 
runs for the full data set. Of the 46 systems using the 
full data set, 24 used automatic onstruction of queries, 
18" used manual construction, and 4 used interactive 
query construction. 
Figure 10 shows the recall/precision curves for the 12 
TREC-3 groups with the highest non-interpolated aver- 
age precision for the routing queries. (The grey lines 
only serve to allow more systems to be shown.) The 
nms are ranked by the average precision and only one 
run per group is shown (both official runs sometimes 
would have qualified for this set). A short summary of 
the techniques used in these runs follows. For more 
details on the various runs and procedures, please see 
the cited papers in the TREC-3 proceedings. 
c i ty r l  - -  City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-3" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, S. Jones, M.M. Hancock- 
Beaulieu and M. Gatford) used the same probabilistic 
techniques as for the adhoc task, but constructed the 
query using a very selective set of terms (17 on average) 
from the relevant documents. 
p i rcs3  -- Queens College, CUNY ("TREC-3 Ad-Hoc, 
Routing Retrieval and Thresholding Experiments using 
PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok, L. Grunfeld and D.D. Lewis) 
used a spreading activation model based on the topic 
and on terms selected from about 35% of the relevant 
material. 
INQI03  - University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Document Retrieval and Routing Using the 
INQUERY System" by John Broglio, James P. Callan, 
W. Bruce Croft and Daniel W. Nachbar) used the infer- 
ence net engine (same as for the adhoc task), with topic 
expansion of about 60 terms selected from the relevant 
documents. 
dor tR1  --  University of Dortmund ("Routing and Ad- 
hoe Retrieval with the TREC-3 Collection in a Dis- 
tributed Loosely Federated Environment" by Nikolaus 
Walczuch, Norbert Fuhr, Michael Pollmann and Birgit 
Sievers) used the SMART retrieval system with a Roc- 
chio relevance feedback expansion adding 12% new 
terms and 4% new phrases from the training documents. 
l s i r2  -- Bellcore ("Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI): 
TREC-3 Report" by Susan Dumais) used the latent 
semantic indexing system to construct areduced imen- 
sion vector centroid of the relevant documents (no use 
was made of the topics). 
Crn lRR -- Comell University ("Automatic Query 
Expansion Using SMART: TREC-3 by Chris Buckley, 
Gerard Salton, James Allan and Amit Singhal) used the 
vector-space SMART system and a basic Rocchio rele- 
vance feedback algorithm adding about 300 terms and 
30 phrases to the topic. 
Brk ly8  - -  University of California, Berkeley ("Experi- 
ments in the Probabilistic Retrieval of Full Text Docu- 
ments" by William S. Cooper, Aitao Chen and Fredric 
C. Gey) used only the relevant documents to select a 
large number of terms (average 1,357 terlns/topic) 
which were combined and weighted using a logodds 
formula. A chi-square test was used to select he terms. 
westp2  - West Publishing Company ("TREC-3 Ad Hoc 
Retrieval and Routing Experiments using the WIN Sys- 
tem" by Paul Thompson, Howard Turtle, Bokyung Yang 
and James Flood) used their commercial product (WIN), 
but expanded the topics using up to 50 terms from spe- 
cially selected parts of relevant documents. 
l osPA l  - Logicon, Inc. ("Research in Automatic Profile 
Creation and Relevance Ranking with LMDS" by Julian 
A. Yochum) constructed profiles based on the top 10 
selected terms from the relevant documents, with term 
selection based on binomial probability distributions. 
The profile was used to select all documents containing 
any of those terms and the documents were then ranked 
using a weighting formula. 
UCFIO1 - University of Central Florida ("Using 
Database Schemas to Detect Relevant Information" by 
James Dfiscoll, Gary Theis and Gene Billings) manually 
constructed entity-relationship (ER) schemas for each 
topic and also manually created synonym lists for each 
labelled component in the ER schema. These schemas 
and lists were then used to select and rank documents. 
nyu i r2  - -  New York University ("Natural Language 
Information Retrieval: TREC-3 Report" by Tomek 
Strzalkowski, Jose CarbaUo and Mihnea Marinescu) 
used NLP techniques to discover syntactic phrases in 
the documents. Both single terms and phrases were 
indexed and specially weighted. The nyu i r2  run  used  
topic expansion based on the relevant documents. 
11 of these runs were abbreviated runs from one group 
FDF2 --  Paracel, Inc. ("The FDF Query Generation 
395 
Workbench" by K.I. Yu, P. Scheibe and F. Nordby) used 
a series of tools to generate profiles. These tools used 
statistical methods to create several alternative queries, 
and automatically evaluated the queries against the 
training data to select he best query for each topic. 
The recall/precision curves shown in Figure 10 are 
very close in performance for the routing, with the 
Scheffe" tests done by Jean Tague-Sutcliffe showing that 
there is no significant differences between the top 22 
runs. It is, however, useful to look at the results on a per 
topic basis to find trends in performance across tech- 
niques. 
The main issue for the TREC-3 routing runs is how to 
best select erms for topic expansion. Note that for the 
adhoc task the main issue was how to expand a topic 
beyond its original terms, hopefully with as little loss in 
precision as possible. For the routing task, however, the 
pool of terms for expansion is easily determined (i.e., 
the terms in the relevant documents), and the problem is 
how to select erms from this very large pool. Corre- 
spondingly, the major differences in results between the 
routing runs are not how many relevant documents were 
"missed" (as for the adhoc task), but how well the rele- 
vant documents were ranked. 
An example of this is a comparison between the two 
City runs. The cityrl system used all relevant docu- 
ments to select he top T terms, where T varied between 
3 and 100 (average 47). Then they used the training 
material to optimize the queries, selecting only those 
terms that improved results. On average only about 17 
terms were used in an optimized query. The unopti- 
mized version of these queries was used at the cityr2 run 
(not shown in Figure 10), which did not work as well. 
The difference in average precision between the two 
nms is only about 12%, but the optimized cityrl run had 
14 superior topics (topics with a 20% or more 
improvement in average precision), all caused by better 
ranking (more relevant documents moved into the top 
100 documents from the top 1000 documents). A simi- 
lar comparison can be made between the cityrl run and 
the pircs3 run. Even though there were more relevant 
documents found by the pircs3 technique, the cityrl run 
had 15 superior topics (versus 7 superior forpircs3), all 
caused by better anking. 
The ability to assign better ranks to relevant docu- 
ments is not strictly tied to being highly selective of 
terms. A comparison of the cityrl, pircs3, INQI03 and 
CrnIRR runs shows that he INQUERY and PIRCS tech- 
niques both used an average of around 100 terms in 
their queries and retrieved the largest number of relevant 
documents in the top 1000 documents. The cityrl nan, 
with only about 17 terms, missed a few relevant 
documents, but did a much better job of ranking the 
ones they found. However, even though the CrnlRR run 
used a massive xpansion of greater than 300 terms, the 
CrnlRR runs were stronger in ranking than in finding 
relevant documents. A comparison of the 1NQ103 run 
to that of Cornell shows that Cornell had 12 "inferior" 
topics, mostly due to missed relevant documents, and 9 
superior topics, mostly due to better ranking. Clearly 
the appropriate number of terms to use in a routing 
query varies across retrieval techniques. This same 
result was seen in the adhoc task, where the appropriate 
number of expansion terms also varied across ystems. 
The top routing results tend to fall into three cate- 
gories -- those groups that used minimal effort in select- 
ing terms (CrnlRR, lsir2), those groups that selected 
terms based on using only a portion of the relevant 
material (pircs3 and westp2), and those groups that used 
all the material, but carefully selected terms (cityrl, 
1NQ103, brkly8 and losPA1). 
Both the Cornell runs and the LSI runs were repeats 
of their TREC-2 techniques. The LSI runs tested using 
only the topic to create a query (no expansion) versus 
using all the relevant documents (no topic) to create a 
centroid for use as the query (the Isir2 run). There is a 
30% improvement using the relevant documents only. 
The Comell runs used both the topic and a massive Roc- 
chio relevance feedback expansion (300+ terms). Both 
groups used techniques based on a vector-space model 
(loosely based for the LSI technique), and this model 
appears to be able to effectively rank documents despite 
very massive queries. The strength of the Cornell rank- 
ing was mentioned before, but the LSI ranking is com- 
parable or even better (18 superior topics for LSI, 9 for 
Cornell, all caused by better anking). 
Two groups (the PIRCS system and the WIN system 
from West) experimented with using only portions of 
the training data. This is mostly an efficiency issue, but 
also serves as a term selection method. The pircs4 run 
(not shown in Figure 10) used only short documents, 
where short is defined as not more than 160 unique non- 
stop stems. This run did somewhat worse than the 
pircs3 run, where a combination of these short docu- 
ments and the top 2400 subdocuments were used. In 
both runs many fewer documents were used (12% and 
35% of the relevant material respectively), yet the 
results were excellent. The West group tried multiple 
experiments u ing various egments of the relevant doc- 
uments (best documents only, best 200 paragraphs, and 
best op paragraph). Up to 50 terms were added using a 
combination ofthe various approaches, with selection of 
approaches done on a per topic basis. This selective use 
of material caused some relevant documents to be 
missed. A comparison of the westp2 run and the 
396 
1NQI03 run shows that the 12 topics in which the 
1NQI03 run was superior were mostly caused by new 
relevant documents being found, whereas the 7 topics in 
which the westp2 run was superior were all caused by 
better anking. 
Four groups (cityrl, INQI03, brkly8, and LosPA1) 
used all the relevant documents, but made careful selec- 
tion of the terms to use. The City results have already 
been discussed. The INQI03 run used an adaptation of 
the Roechio algorithm with their inference ngine tech- 
nique. A statistical formula was used to select he top 
32 terms to use for expansion for each topic, and then 
30 additional terms were selected based on their prox- 
imity to those terms already selected. This technique 
retrieved a large number of the relevant documents into 
the top 1000 slots, but had more difficulties doing the 
ranking within that set. The brkly8 run selected an aver- 
age of over 1000 terms by using a chi-square test to 
indicate which stems were statistically associated with 
document relevance to a topic. These terms were 
weighted and used as the query. The losPA1 run used a 
similar technique, calculating a binomial probability to 
select he top 1000 terms, selecting a pool of documents 
using an OR of the top 10 terms, and then scoring the 
documents using a weighting algorithm based on occur- 
rances of the 1000 terms in those documents. If results 
from these two systems are compared to the more tradi- 
tional 1NQI03 method, it seems that the strengths of 
these methods are in the ranking, with some problems in 
missing relevant documents. 
As was the case in earlier TRECs, the manual con- 
struction of routing queries was not very competitive 
with automatic query construction. The manual INQ104 
run, consisting of a merge of the INQI03 queries and a 
manually edited version of these queries was little dif- 
ferent in results from the 1NQ103 run. An exception to 
this was the reasonable r sults of the UCFI01 run. This 
run combined manually constructed etailed entity- 
relationship schema with manually constructed syn- 
onym lists. These were run against the documents, pro- 
ducing results that are comparable with the automatic 
results. 
There is some improvement in overall routing results 
compared with those from TREC-2. This is mostly 
shown by the comparative position of the CrnIRR run, 
which was the "top-ranked" run in TREC-2, and now is 
more the "middle of the pack." 
5.5 TREC-4 Routing Results 
The routing evaluation used a specifically selected 
subset of the training topics, with that selection guided 
by the availability of new testing data. The ease of 
obtaining more Federal Register documents suggested 
the use of topics that tended to find relevant documents 
in the Federal Register and 25 of the routing topics were 
picked using this criteria. The second set of 25 routing 
topics were selected to build a subcollection in the 
domain of computers. The testing documents for the 
computer issues were documents from the Internet, plus 
part of the Ziff collection (see table 3). 
There were a total of 28 sets of results for routing 
evaluation, with 26 of them based on runs for the full 
data set. Of the 26 systems using the full data set, 23 
used automatic construction ofqueries, and 3 used man- 
ual construction. There were 2 sets of category B rout- 
ing results, both using automatic construction of 
queries. 
Figure 11 shows the recall/precision curves for the 6 
TREC-4 groups with the highest non-interpolated aver- 
age precision for the routing queries. The runs are 
ranked by the average precision. A short summary of 
the techniques used in these runs follows. For more 
details on the various runs and procedures, please see 
the cited papers in the TREC-4 proceedings. 
1NQ203 -- University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Recent Experiments with INQUERY" by James Allan, 
Lisa Bellesteros, James P. Callan, W. Bruce Croft and 
Zhihong Lu) used the inference net engine (same as for 
the adhoe task). They made major refinements of the 
algorithms used in TREC-3. The queries were con- 
structed using a Rocchio weighting approach for terms 
in relevant and non-relevant training documents, and 
then these queries were expanded by 250 new concepts 
(adjacent erm pairs) found in the 200-word best- 
matching windows in the relevant documents. Further 
experiments were made in weighting terms, including 
use of the Dynamic Feedback Optimization from Cor- 
nell (and City University). 
cityr2 -- City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-4" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, M.M. Beaulieu, M. Gat- 
ford and A. Payne") used the same probabilistic tech- 
niques as for the adhoc task, but constructed the query 
using a very selective set of terms (36 on average) from 
the relevant documents. The method used for term 
selection involved optimizing the query based on trying 
different combinations of terms from the relevant docu- 
ments. Since this is a very compute-intensive m thod, 
the work for TREC--4 looked for more efficient methods. 
pircsC-- Queens College, CUNY ("TREC-4 Ad-Hoc, 
Routing Retrieval and Filtering Experiments using 
PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok and L. Grunfeld) used the same 
spreading activation model used in the adhoc task, but

combined the results of four different query experts. 
Two of these query experts used different levels of topic 
expansion (80 terms and 350 terms), and other two were 
trained on specific subsets of the data (FR and Ziff vs 
WSJ, AP and SJMN). 
xerox1  - Xerox Research Center ("Xerox Site Report: 
Four TREC-4 Tracks" by Marti Hearst, Jan Pedersen, 
Peter Pirolli, Hinrich Schutze, Gregory Grefenstette and 
David Hull) used a complex routing algorithm that 
involved using LSI techniques to discover the best fea- 
tures, and then used three different classification tech- 
niques (combined) to rank the documents selected by 
these features. 
Crn lRE  - CorneU University ("New Retrieval 
Approaches Using SMART: TREC-4" by Chris Buck- 
ley, Amit Singhal, Mandar Mitra, (Gerald Salton)) 
worked with the same new SMART algorithms used in 
the adhoc task. Because of inexperience with these new 
algorithms, minimal query expansion was used (only 50 
single terms, as opposed to the TREC-4 300 terms). 
Dynamic query optimization was tried, but did not help. 
nyuge2 - GE Corporate Research and New York Uni- 
versity ("Natural Language Information Retrieval: 
TREC-4 Report" by Tomek Strzalkowski and Jose Perez 
Carballo) used NLP techniques to discover syntactic 
phrases in the documents. Both single terms and 
phrases were indexed and specially weighted. The 
nyuge2 run  used topic expansion of up to 200 terms and 
phrases based on the relevant documents. 
The issue of what features of documents should be 
used for retrieval was the paramount issue for all these 
groups (plus most of the other groups doing the routing 
task). It is interesting that he six groups hown in Fig- 
ure 11 have used very different methods. The Cornell 
group used traditional Rocchio relevance feedback 
methods to locate and weight 50 terms and 10 statistical 
phrases. The statistical phrases are based on term co- 
occurance information for the whole collection, not just 
the relevant and nonrelevant documents. The GE/NYU 
group did a massive xpansion using 200 terms and syn- 
tactic phrases, with those phrases created from a full 
parse of the entire collection of documents. These 
methods can be contrasted with the INQUERY group, 
who started with a traditional Rocchio approach to 
select and weight 50 terms, but then expanded the query 
by 250 word pairs selected from only portions of the rel- 
evant documents. 
The other three groups used less traditional methods. 
The group from City University repeated their very suc- 
cessful technique from TREC-3, in which they first used 
398 
an ordering function to produce a list of terms as candi- 
date terms for the query. This list was then optimized 
by repeatedly trying different sets of terms. The final 
term set in the cityr2 run used an average of 36 terms 
per query, with the number varying across queries. The 
Xerox group started by expanding the query using Roc- 
chio techniques, and used this expanded query to select 
2000 documents. These 2000 documents were then fed 
into a LSI process to reduce the dimensionality of the 
final feature set. The final group, the pircsC run from 
Queens College, CUNY, was the result of four different 
expansions, two using different levels of expansion and 
two using different subeollections of documents for the 
expansion. 
In addition to using different methods to select he 
features for the queries, two of the groups experimented 
with different ways of combining these features. The 
group from Xerox used three different classification 
techniques, combining the results from these three 
"experts". The pircsC group combined the results of 
their four query expansion experts. Both groups found 
that the combination of experts outperformed using a 
single method, even when one method (large expansion 
in the pircs2 case and neural networks in the xerox1 
case) was generally superior. Also both groups found 
that there was a huge variation in performance across 
topics, with some topics performing best for each of the 
various experts. 
The use of two different subeoUections of topics (25 
in each set) for the routing task was, in general, not uti- 
lized by the various groups. However, it is very interest- 
ing to examine the results of the 6 groups hown in Fig- 
ure 11 when broken into the two subsets. This is shown 
in Figure 12. The most prominant feature of these 
graphs is the difference in the shape of the curves. The 
Federal Register subeoUecfion results (shown in grey) 
have a sharper drop in precision early in the curve, but 
better performance in general in the high recall end of 
the curve. Two differences in the subeollections account 
for this. First, the 25 topics in the FR subeollection 
retrieved significantly fewer relevant documents, an 
average of 99 relevant documents, as opposed to an 
average of 164 relevant documents for the computer 
topics. Additionally most of these relevant documents 
are Federal Register documents, which are very long 
and traditionally have been difficult to retrieve. These 
differences account for the sharp drop in precision in the 
low recall end of the curve. The higher performance of
most of these 6 systems at the high recall end of the 
curve is somewhat more puzzling. It may that he types 
of terminology in these subcollections are such that 
training is more effective in the FR subcollection. 
Note that certain of the 6 systems seem more affected 
by the two subcollections. For example, the pircsC run 
is actually better for the FR subcollection than for the 
computer collection. This is likely because this system 
chunks all documents into 550 word segments, and 
therefore is less affected by the long FR documents. In 
contrast, he INQUERY system has excellent results for 
the computer topics, but a sharp drop in high precision 
results for the FR collection 
There looks to be minimal improvement in overall 
routing results compared with those from TREC-3 (Fig- 
ure 13). However, the TREC-4 topics were more diffi- 
cult, particularly the FR topics. Despite the harder top- 
ics, many of the systems achieved performance 
improvements, particularly at the high recall end of the 
curves. This indicates that he ability to find useful fea- 
tures that can retrieve the "hard-to-find" documents i
growing. Such techniques as the use of word pairs from 
highly ranked sections of relevant documents by the 
INQUERY system, and the use of multiple experts in 
the pircsC and xerox1 runs are showing promise. 
6, TREC-4  TRACKS 
Starting with TREC-1, there have always been groups 
that have pursued ifferent goals than achieving high 
recall/precision performances on the adhoc and routing 
tasks. For example, the group from CITRI, Royal Mel- 
bourne Institute of Technology, has investigated effi- 
ciency issues in several of the TREC evaluations. By 
TREC-3 some of these areas had attracted several 
groups, all working towards the same goal. These 
became informal working groups, and in TREC-4 these 
working groups were formalized into "tracks", with spe- 
citie guidelines. 
6.1 The Multilinguai Track 
One of these tracks investigated the issues of retrieval 
in languages other than English. An informal Spanish 
test was run in TREC-3, but the data arrived late and 
few groups were able to take part. A formal multilin- 
gual track was formed in TREC-4 and 10 groups took 
part. Both TREC-3 and TREC-4 used the same docu- 
ments, about 200 megabytes of the E1 Norte newspaper 
from Monterey, Mexico, but there were 25 different top- 
ics for each evaluation. Groups used the adhoc task 
guidelines, and submitted the top 1000 documents 
retrieved for each of the 25 Spanish topics. 
In TREC-3, four groups tried this task. Since there 
was no training data for testing (similar to the startup 
problems for TREC-1), the groups used simple tech- 
niques. No graphs are shown for the results ince there 
were not enough groups to create a sufficient relevance 
pool. For more details on the individual experiments,

tures Derived from Syntax in TREC-3: System Descrip- 
tion" by Alan Smeaton, Ruairi O'DonneU and Fergus 
Kelledy) used a trigram retrieval model, with weighting 
of the trigrams from traditional frequency weighting. A 
Spanish stemmer based on the Porter algorithms was 
also used. 
er ims l  -- Environmental Research Institute of Michigan 
("Using an N-Gram-Based Document Representation 
with a Vector Processing Retrieval Model" by William 
Cavnar) used a quad-gram retrieval model, also with 
weighting using some of the traditional weighting 
mechanisms. 
The major result from this very preliminary experiment 
in a second language was the ease of porting the 
retrieval techniques across languages. Comell reported 
that only 5 to 6 hours of system changes were necessary 
(beyond creation of any stemmers or stopword lists). 
Three of these four groups also did the Spanish task 
in TREC-4, along with 7 new groups. This time there 
was training data (the results of TREC-3), and groups 
were able to do more elaborate testing. Figure 14 shows 
the recall/precision curves for these 10 TREC-4 groups, 
ordered by non-interpolated average precision. The 
cited papers are in the TREC-4 proceedings. 
UCFSP1 - University of Central Florida ("Multi- 
lingual Text Filtering Using Semantic Modeling" by 
James R. Driscoll, Sara Abbott, Kai-Lin Hu, Michael 
Miller and Gary Theis) used semantic modeling of the 
topics. A profile (entity-relationship schema) was man- 
ually built for each topic and lists of synonyms were 
constructed, including the use of an automatic Spanish 
verb form generator. The synonym list and domain list 
(instances of entities) were carefillly built by Sara 
Abbott as part of a student summer project. 
S INQ010 - University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
("Recent Experiments with INQUERY" by James Allan, 
Lisa Bellesteros, James P. Callan, W. Bruce Croft and 
Zhihong Lu) was a Spanish version of the automatic 
TREC-4 INQ201 run for the adhoc tests. The Spanish 
stemmer from TREC-3 was used, and terms were 
expanded using the basic InFinder technique (with a 
new noun phrase recognizer for Spanish). 
xerox-sp2  -- Xerox Research Center ("Xerox Site 
Report: Four TREC-4 Tracks" by Marti Hearst, Jan Ped- 
ersen, Peter Pirolli, Hinrich Schutze, Gregory Grefen- 
stette and David Hull) tested several Spanish language 
analysis tools, including a finite-state morphology and a 
hidden-Markov part-of-speech tagger to produce correct 
stemmed forms and to identify verbs and noun phrases. 
The SMART system was used as the basic search 
engine. Expansion was done using the top 20 retrieved 
documents. 
Crn lSE  -- Comell University ("New Retrieval 
Approaches Using SMART: TREC-4" by Chris Buck- 
ley, Amit Singhal, Mandar M/tra, (Gerald Salton)) is a 
repeat of the TREC-3 work, using a simple stemmer and 
stopword list, and expanding by 50 terms from the top 
20 documents. The TREC-3 version of SMART was 
used. 
gmuauto  - George Mason University ("Improving 
Accuracy and Run-Time Performance for TREC-4" by 
David A. Grossrnan, David O. Holmes, Ophir Frieder, 
Matthew D. Nguyen and Christopher E. Kingsbury) 
used 5-grams with a vector-space type system for rank- 
ing. A Spanish stopword list was constructed using a 
Spanish linguist to prune a list of the most frequent 500 
terms in the text. 
Brk lySP3  - University of California, Berkeley ("Logis- 
tic Regression at TREC4: Probabilistic Retrieval from 
Full Text Document Collections" by Fredric C. Gey, 
Aitao Chen, Jianzhang He and Jason Meggs) trained 
their logistic regression method on the Spanish results 
from TREC-3. They also built a rule-based Spanish 
stemmer, including a borrowed file of all verb forms for 
irregular verbs. The queries were formed manually by 
translating them into English, searching the MELVYL 
NEWS database, reformulating the English queries 
based on these searches, and then translating the queries 
back into Spanish.

c i t r i - sp2  - RMIT, Australia ("Similarity Measures for 
Short Queries" by Ross Wilkinson, Justin Zobel, and 
Ron Sacks-Davis) tried the combination methods used 
for their English results. A stop-list of 316 words was 
created, along with a Spanish stemmer that principally 
removed regular verb sutfixes. Experiments were done 
using combinations ofstopped and stemmed results. 
DCUSPO - -  Dublin City University ("TREC-4 Experi- 
ments at Dublin City University: Thresholding Posting 
Lists, Query Expansion with WordNet and POS Tagging 
in Spanish" by Alan F. Smeaton, Fergus Kelledy and 
Ruairi O'Donnell) used the NMSU part-of-speech tag- 
ger (at NMSU) as input to the SMART system. This 
method also produced the base forms of the terms. The 
traditional ~f* IDF  weighting was used, but adjectives 
were double-weighted. 
ACQSPA - -  Department of Defense ("Acquaintance: 
Language-Independent Document Categorization by N- 
Grams" by Stephen Huffman) used a 5-gram method 
which normalizes the resulting document vectors by 
subtracting a "collection" centroid vector. Minimal 
topic expansion was done. 
crn lmlO - -  New Mexico State University ("A TREC 
Evaluation of Query Translation Methods for Multi- 
Lingual Text Retrieval" by Mark Davis and Ted Dun- 
ning) investigated five different methods of query trans- 
lation. The Spanish topics were first manually trans- 
lated into English for use in these tests. Then five dif- 
ferent methods were used to automatically translate the 
topics into Spanish. The five methods were 1) a term- 
by-term translation using a bilingual dictionary, 2) use 
of the parallel corpus (UN corpus) for high-frequency 
terms, 3) use of a parallel corpus to locate statistically 
significant terms, 4) optimization of 2) and 5) an LSI 
technique on the parallel corpus. 
In general the groups participating in the Spanish task 
were using the same techniques as for English. This is 
consistent with the philosophy that the basic search 
engine techniques are language-independent. Only the 
auxiliary techniques, uch as stopword lists and stem- 
mers, need to be language dependent. Several of the 
groups did major linguistic work on these auxiliary files, 
such as the noun-phrase identifier necessary for expan- 
sion using InFinder (the INQUERY system) and the two 
new Spanish stemmers (Brk lySP3  and  c i t r i - sp2) .  Two 
groups used n-gram methods, as did two of the groups 
in TREC-3. 
Several other issues unique to this track should be 
mentioned. First, the outstanding results from the Uni- 
versity of Central Florida indicate the benefits of very 
402 
careful building of the manual queries, in this case by 
building extensive synonym sets and other such lists. 
The utility of this technique outside the rather limited 
domain of the TREC-4 topic set is a question however. 
The group from Xerox did extensive work with Spanish 
language tools, but the effort had the same type of mini- 
real effects generally seen in English. As a final point, 
the query translation experiments by New Mexico State 
University demonstrated a very interesting approach to 
the problem of multilingual retrieval, and hopefully will 
be followed by better esults in TREC-5. 
This track will be run again in TREC-5, with new 
Spanish data and 25 new Spanish topics. Also new for 
TREC-5 will be a Chinese retrieval task, with Chinese 
data and 25 Chinese topics. 
6.2 The Confusion Track 
The "confusion" track represents an extension of the 
current asks to deal with corrupted ata such as would 
come from OCR or speech input. This was a new track 
proposed uring the TREC-3 conference. The track fol- 
lowed the adhoc task, but using only the category B 
data. This data was randomly corrupted at NIST using 
character deletions, ubstitutions, and additions to create 
data with a 10% and 20% error ate (i.e., 10% or 20% of 
the characters were affected). Note that this process is 
neutral in that it does not model OCR or speech input. 
Four groups used the baseline and 10% corruption level; 
only two groups tried the 20% level. Figure 15 shows 
the recall/precision curves for the confusion track, 
ordered by non-interpolated average precision. Two or 
three runs are shown for each group, the base run (no 
corruption), the 10% corruption level, and (sometimes) 
the 20% corruption level. The cited papers are in the 
TREC--4 proceedings. 
CrnlB, CrnlBclO -- Cornell University ("New Retrieval 
Approaches Using SMART: TREC-4" by Chris Buck- 
ley, Amit Singhal, Mandar Mitra, (Gerald Salton)) used 
a two-pass correction technique (only one-pass i imple- 
mented for this nm). In the first pass, the query is 
expanded by all variants that are one transformation 
from the query word. The second pass improves the 
final ranking of the documents. This method avoids the 
use of a dictionary for correction of corrupted text. 
ACQUNC, ACQCIO, ACQC20 -- Department of 
Defense ("Acquaintance: Language-Independent Docu- 
ment Categorization by N-Grams" by Stephen Huffman) 
used an n-gram method which normalizes the resulting 
document vectors by subtracting a "collection" centroid 
vector. A 5-gram was used for the 10% corruption level 
and a 4-gram for the 20% level. 
gmucO, gmuclO -- George Mason University Clmprov- 
ing Accuracy and Run-Time Performance for TREC-4" 
by David A. Grossman, David O. Holmes, Ophir 
Frieder, Matthew D. Nguyen and Christopher E. Kings- 
bury) used a 4-gram method with a vector-space type 
system for ranking. A thresholding technique was tried 
that only worked with the best 75 percent of the 4-gram 
query in order to improve fficiency. 
rutfum, rutfuv, rutscn20 - Rutgers University ("Two 
Experiments on Retrieval with Corrupted Data and 
Clean Queries in the TREC-4 Adlaoc Task Environment: 
Data Fusion and Pattern Scanning" by Kwong Bor Ng 
and Paul B. Kantor) tried the use of 5-grams and data 
fusion. The first experiment merged the results of two 
runs, one using 5-grams and one using words. The sec- 
ond experiment was a pattern scanning scheme called 
dotted 5-grams. 
Since this was the first time this task had been tried, 
and since also there were very few participating groups, 
not much can be said about the results. Three of the 
four groups used N-grams, a method that is not known 
for the best results on uncorrupted ata. The fourth 
group was unable to implement their full algorithms in 
time for the results. The track will be run again in 
TREC-5. Actual OCR output will be used at that time, 
as opposed to the randomly corrupted ata used in 
TREC-4. 
6.3 The Database Merging Track 
A third area, that of properly handling heterogeneous 
collections uch as the five main "subcollections" in
TREC, was addressed inTREC-3 by the Siemens group 
(see paper "The Collection Fusion Problem" by Ellen 
Voorhees; Narendra Gupta and Ben Johnson-Laird in 
the TREC-3 proceedings). This group examined two 
different collection fusion techniques and was able to 
obtain results within 10% of the average precision of a 
run using a merged collection index. This type of inves- 
tigation is important for real-world collections, and also 
to allow researchers totake advantage of possible varia- 
tions in retrieval techniques for heterogeneous collec- 
tions. 
The general interest in this area led to the formation 
of a formal track in TREC-4. There were 10 subcollec- 
tions defined corresponding tothe various dates of the 
data, i.e. the three different years of the Wall Street Jour- 
nal, the two different years of the AP newswire, the two 
sets of Ziff documents (one on each disk), and the three 
single subcollections (the Federal Register, the San Jose 
Mercury News, and the U.S. Patents). The 3 participat- 
ing groups ran the adhoc topics separately on each of 
the 10 subcollections, merged the results, and submitted

these results, along with a baseline run treating the sub- 
collections as a single collection, 
Figure 16 shows the recall/precision curves for this 
track, ordered by non-interpolated average precision. 
Two runs are shown for each group, the base run 
(indexed as a single database), and the best of their 
merged runs. The cited papers are in the TREC-4 pro- 
ceedings. 
padreZ, padreW- -  Australian National University 
("Proximity Operators -- So Near and Yet So Far" by 
David Hawking and Paul Thistlewaite) used manual 
queries with proximity operators. Since there are no 
collection-dependent variables in this system, the run 
using the 10 separate collections i equivalent to the run 
using the entire collection. 
1NQ201, INQ207 -- University of Massachusetts at
Amherst ("Recent Experiments with INQUERY" by 
James Allan, Lisa Bellesteros, James P. Callan, W. 
Bruce Croft and Zhihong Lu) tried five variations of a 
basic method of collection merging \[8\]. The basic 
method scored each collection against he topic, and 
then weighted the document results by their collection 
score. 
siemsl, siems2 - Siemens Corporate Research 
("Siemens TREC-4 Report: Further Experiments with 
Database Merging" by Ellen M. Voorhees) tried two dif- 
ferent methods, both based on information about the 
previous queries (training topics) as opposed to using 
information about he document collection itself. 
If results are produced without use of collection irtfor- 
matiort, hen the merging process is trivial, as illustrated 
by the padre runs. Certainly this is one method of han- 
dling the problems of merging results from different 
databases. However this precludes using information 
about he collection to modify the various algorithms in 
the search engine, and, even more importantly, it does 
not deal with the issue about which collection to select. 
An implied question in this track is the hypothesis that 
one might want to bias searching towards certain collec- 
tions, either by developing collection scores (such as the 
INQUERY work) or by developing a sense of history 
from previous queries (the Siemens work). 
More work needs to be done in this area, and hope- 
fully more groups will try this track in TREC-5. 
6.4 The Filtering Track 
The filtering track represents a variation of the current 
routing task. For several years some participants have 
been concerned about he definition of the routing task, 
and a few groups experimented in TREC-3 with an 
alternative method of evaluating routing. For details on 
one of these experiments, ee the paper "TREC-3 Ad- 
Hoc, Routing Retrieval and Thresholding Experiments 
using PIRCS" by K.L. Kwok, L. Grunfeld and D.D. 
Lewis in the TREC-3 proceedings. 
In TREC-4 the track was formalized and used the 
same topics, training documents, and test documents as 
the routing task. The difference was that he results ub- 
mitted for the filtering runs were unranked sets of docu- 
ments atisfying three "utility function" criteria. These 
criteria were designed to approximate a high precision 
run, a high recall run, and a "balanced" run. For more 
details, see the paper "The TREC-4 Filtering Track" by 
David Lewis (in the TREC-4 proceedings). 
Figure 17 shows the results of the four groups that 
tried this track. There are 3 pairs of bars for each sys- 
tem, one pair corresponding toeach of the three utility 
function criteria. The first of the pairs (the left-most and 
the right-most bars) correspond to the high preci- 
sion/low recall run. The second pair (the second and 
fifth bars) correspond ~o the balanced (medium preci- 
sion/medium recall) run, and the third pair (high 
recall/low precision run) are shown in the middle two 
bars. 
One desired type of system behavior is the "stairstep" 
effect seen, for example, in the run from HNC Software 
Inc. (see paper "Using CONVECTIS, A Context Vector- 
Based Indexing System for TREC-4" by Joel L. Car- 
leton, William R. Caid and Robert V. Sasseen in the 
TREC-4 proceedings). When this system is compared 
with the next two systems (pircs and xerox), it can be 
seen that while the HNC system got a better separation 
of the runs, the other two groups got better esults in 
general, particularly for the balanced run. 
This was the first time this track had been tried, and 
the development of evaluation techniques was the most 
critical area. Now that these techniques are in place, it 
is expected that more groups will take part in the track 
in TREC-5. 
6.5 The Interactive Track 
The largest area of focussed experimentation i  
TREC-3 was in interactive query construction, with four 
groups participating. One of the questions addressed by 
these groups was how well humans could perform the 
routing task, given a "rules-free" environment and 
access to the training material. The larger issue 
addressed by these experiments, however, was the entire 
interaction process in retrieval systems, ince the "batch

most systems are used. 
Figure 18 shows the three sets of results for the cate- 
gory A interactive runs in TREC-3, plus several baseline 
runs for comparison. A short summary of the systems 
follows, and readers are referred to the individual papers 
in the TREC-3 proceedings for more details. 
TOPIC2 -- Verity, Inc. ("Interactive Document Retrieval 
Using TOPIC (A report on the TREC-3 experiment)" by 
Richard Tong) used 12 Verity staff members ranging in 
search experience using TOPIC from novice to expert o 
build their queries. The initial queries were the manual- 
constructed queries used by Verity in TREC-2, and the 
results from these queries are shown in Figure 18 as 
TOPIC1. The searchers then improved the initial 
queries by periodically evaluating their "improved" 
queries against the training data. When sufficiently 
improved scores were achieved, the queries were 
declared final and used for TREC-3. 
rutirl,  rutir2 - Rutgers University ("New Tools and Old 
Habits: The Interactive Searching Behavior of Expert 
Online Searches using INQUERY" by Jurgen Koene- 
mann, Richard Quatrain, Colleen Cool and Nicholas 
Belkin) used the INQUERY system and had 10 experi- 
enced online searchers with no prior experience using 
that system build their queries. The entire query build- 
ing process was restricted to 20 minutes per topic, and 
used the training data both for automatic relevance f ed- 
back (if desired) and for the searchers to check if a 
given retrieved ocument was relevant (as opposed to 
periodically evaluating their results). At some point 
during the 20 minute limit the queries were declared fin- 
ished by the searchers and the results from these queries 
are shown in Figure 18 as rutirl. As a comparison, the 
experimenters al o did the task themselves (rutir2). 
cityil -- City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-3" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, S. Jones, M.M. Hancock- 
Beaulieu and M. Gatford) used the OKAPI team as 
searchers. The initial query was manually generated 
using traditional operations. The retrieved ocuments 
(or a brief summary of them) were then displayed, and 
searchers checked the relevance judgments (generally 
viewing 10 or 12 relevant documents). Automatic rele- 
vance feedback was then applied and the searchers 
could choose to modify the resulting query or not (35 of 
the 50 topics were modified). Multiple iterations could 
be done before a decision was made on the final query. 
Not shown in Figure 18 is a category B interactive r sult 
from the University of Toronto ("Interactive Exploration 
as a Formal Text Retrieval Method: How Well can 
Interactivity Compensate for Unsophisticated Retrieval 
Algorithms" by Nipon Charoenkitkarn, Mark Chignell 
and Gene Golovchinsky). This group developed their 
TREC experiments from what was initially a browsing 
system. Boolean operators and promixity operators 
were used to construct the initial query. The queries 
were then "loosened" until around 1000 documents were 
retrieved. Then the results of these queries were run 
against he training data and reviewed, with changes 
possibly made to the query based on retrieval results. 
As a group, the interactive results were considerably 
worse than the automatic routing results. This was 
somewhat unexpected since in all four cases the queries 
could be classified as the best manual queries possible. 
Although no definite reasons have been cited for this, 
the likely cause is the very strong performance of the 
automatic systems given the large amounts of training 
data. 
A comparison of the City interactive run (cityil) and 
the City automatic run (cityal) illustrates the problems. 
For BOTH runs, the query lengths were short, an aver- 
age of around 17 terms. Only about 20% of these terms 
were in common, i.e., the searchers (cityil) and the 
"computer" (cityal) picked different sets of terms. The 
difference in the results from these queries, however, is 
very large, as shown in Figure 18. The automatic run 
has a 63% improvement in average precision, and 33 
topics with superior results (a 20% or more 
improvement in average precision) versus one topic with 
inferior esults. 
Regardless of the poorer performance, all four groups 
were able to draw interesting conclusions about their 
own interactive experiments. The Verity group found a 
24% improvement in results (TOPIC1 to TOPIC2) that 
can be obtained by humans using the training material 
over the (manually created) initial query. Other groups 
were able to gain insight into better tools needed by 
their system or insight into how online searchers handle 
the new techniques available. Of particular interest are 
the reports in these papers about the detailed 
human/computer interactions, asthis provides insight on 
how systems might work in an operational setting. 
A formal interactive track was formed for TREC-4, 
with the double goal of developing better methodologies 
for interactive evaluation and investigating in depth how 
users search the TREC topics. Eleven groups took part 
in this track in TREC-4, using a subset of the adhoc top- 
ics. Many different types of experiments were run, but 
the common thread was that all groups used the same 
topics, performed the same task(s), and recorded the 
same information about how the searches were done. 
Task 1 was to retrieve as many relevant documents as 
407 
possible within a certain timeframe. Task 2 was to con- 
stmct he best query possible. 
Three of the four groups that did interactive query 
construction i  TREC-3 also participated in TREC-4. 
Seven new groups also tried this track. The cited papers 
are in the TREC-4 proceedings. 
ru t in t l ,  rut int2  - Rutgers University ("Using Relevance 
Feedback and Ranking in Interactive Searching" by 
Nicholas J. Belkin, Colleen Cool, Jurgen Koenemann, 
Kwong Bor Ng and Soyeon Park) recruited 50 searchers 
for this task. The INQUERY search engine was used, 
and the particular emphasis was on studying the use of 
ranking and relevance f edback by these searchers. 
c i ty i l  - -  City University, London ("Okapi at TREC-3" 
by S.E. Robertson, S. Walker, S. Jones, M.M. Hancock- 
Beaulieu and M. Gatford) used members of their team 
to evaluate theft new GUI interface to OKAPI. They 
concentrated onexamining the various tages of search- 
ing, and kept notes on items of interest, such as how 
many rifles were examined, how many iterations were 
run, and how the queries were edited at various times in 
the search process. 
UoJTo l  - -  University of Toronto ("Is Recall Relevant? 
An Analysis of How User Interface Conditions affect 
Strategies and Performance in Large Scale Text 
Retrieval" by Nipon Charoenkitkarn, Mark H. Chignell 
and Gene Golovchinsky) used 36 searchers on a new 
version of their system called BrowslR. The goal of 
their experiments was to compare three different strate- 
gies for constructing queries: a text markup (similar to 
that done by this group in TREC-3), a query typing 
method, and a hybrid method. Both experts and novices 
were used. 
ETHI01  --  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) 
("Highlighting Relevant Passages for Users of Interac- 
tive SPIDER Retrieval System" by Daniel Knaus, Elke 
Mittendorf and Peter Sc~uble and Paraic Sheridan) 
experimented with several algorithms to highlight he 
most relevant passages, and tested this on I 1 users as an 
aid to relevance f edback. 
XERINT1,  XEROXINT2 --  Xerox Research Center 
("Xerox Site Report: Four TREC-4 Tracks" by Marti 
Hearst, Jan Pedersen, Peter Pirolli, Hinrich Schutze, 
Gregory Grefenstette and David Hull) tried three differ- 
ent modes of searching interfaces. The first was the 
Scatter/Gather method of visualizing the document 
space, the second was the TileBars to visualize the doc- 
urnents, and the third was the more traditional ranked 
list of titles from a vector space search engine.

used the CLARIT system interactively to study the 
effects of the quality of a user's relevance judgments, 
the effects of rime constraints on searching, and the 
effects of relevance feedback on the final results of

an experiment totest how much of the document eeded 
to be read in order to determine document relevancy for 
input to relevance f edback. They tested quick scans vs 
full reading. 
The various results presented from this track were 
very interesting and useful. However, all participants 
were concerned about the difficulties of comparing 
results. One of the major outcomes of this track in 
TREC-4 was the awareness of the large number of vari- 
ables that need to be controlled in order to compare 
results. Some of these, such as the variation in perfor- 
mance across topics, affect all the TREC tasks, but the 
human element in the interactive track compounds the 
problem immensely. The emphasis in TREC-5 work 
will be on learning to control or monitor some of these 
variables as a first step to providing better evaluation 
methodology. 
7. Summary 
The TREC-3 and TREC-4 evaluations have produced 
many important experiments for all the participating 
408 
groups. Some general conclusions can be drawn from 
each evaluation effort. 
The main conclusions that can be drawn from 
TREC-3 are as follows: 
? Automatic construction of routers or filters from 
training data was very effective, much more effective 
than manual construction of these types of queries. 
This held even if the manual construction was based 
on unrestricted use of the training data. 
? Expansion of the "less-rich" TREC-3 topics was 
highly successful, using either automatic topic expan- 
sion, manual topic expansion, or manually modified 
versions of automatically expanded topics. Many dif- 
ferent techniques were effective, with research just 
beginning in this new area. 
? The use of passage retrieval, subdocnments, and local 
weighting brought consistent performance 
improvements, especially in the adhoc task. Experi- 
ments in TREC-3 showed continued improvement 
coming from various methods of using these tech- 
niques to improve ranking. 
? Preliminary results suggested that the extension of 
basic English retrieval techniques into another lan- 
guage (in particular Spanish) did not appear difficult. 
TREC-3 represented the first large-scale test of this 
portability issue. 
Do these conclusions hold in the real world of text 
retrieval? Certainly the use of automatic construction of
routers will work in any environment having reasonable 
amounts of training material. Of greater question is the 
transferability of the adhoc results. Two particular 
issues need to be addressed here. First, even though the 
topics in TREC-3 were 'less-rich", they were still con- 
siderably longer than most queries used in operational 
settings. A couple of sentences i  likely to be the maxi- 
mum a user is willing to type into a computer, and it is 
unclear if the TREC topic expansion methods would 
work on these shorter input strings. Shorter topics may 
also need different echniques of passage retrieval and 
local weighting. TREC-4 addressed this issue by using 
appropriately shorter topics. 
The second mismatch of the TREC-3 (and TREC-4) 
results to the real-world is the emphasis on high recall in 
TREC. Requesting 1000 ranked documents and calcu- 
lating the results on these goes well beyond average user 
needs. Karen Sparck Jones addressed this issue by 
looking at retrieval performance based only on the top 
30 documents retrieved \[9\], and has updated her conclu- 
sions for TREC-3 and TREC-4 in appendices to the 
appropriate proceedings. An improvement of 20% in 
precision at this cutoff means that six additional relevant 
documents will be returned to the user, and this is likely 
to be noticeable by many users. Many of the techniques 
used in TREC produced this difference; additionally 
some of the tools being investigated in TREC, such as 
the topic expansion tools, will make query modification 
much easier for the average user. 
The main conclusions that can be drawn from 
TREC-4 are as follows: 
? The much shorter topics in the adhoc task caused all 
systems trouble. The expansion methods used in 
TREC-3 continued to work, but obviously needed 
modifications. The types of passage retrieval used in 
TREC-3 did not work. The fact that the performance 
of the manually-build queries was also hurt by the 
short opics implies that there are some issues involv- 
ing the use of very short topics in TREC that need 
fimher investigation. It may be that the statistical 
"clues" presented by these shorter topics are simply 
not enough to provide good retrieval performance in
the batch testing environment of TREC. The topics 
to be used in TREC-5 will contain both a short and a 
long version to aid in these timber investigations. 
? Despite the problems with the short topics, many of 
the systems made major modifications to their term 
weighting algorithms. In particular, the SMART 
group from ComeU University and the INQUERY 
group from the University of Massachusetts at 
Amherst produced new algorithms that yielded much 
better esults (on the longer TREC-3 queries), and 
their TREC-4 results were not lowered as much as 
they would have been. 
? There were five tracks run in TREC-4. 
? Interactive - 11 groups investigated searching as 
an interactive task by examining the process as 
well as the outcome. The major result of this track, 
in addition to interesting experiments, was an 
awareness ofthe difficulties of comparing results in 
an interactive t sting environment. 
? Multilingual - 10 groups working with 250 
megabytes of Spanish and 25 topics verified the 
ease of porting to a new language (at least in a lan- 
guage with no problems in locating word bound- 
aries). Additionally some improved Spanish stem- 
mers were built. 
? Multiple database merging - 4 groups investigated 
techniques for merging results from the various 
TREC subeollections. 
? Data corruption -- 4 groups examined the effects of 
corrupted ata (such as would come from an OCR 
environment) by using corrupted versions of the 
409 
? Filtering -- 4 groups evaluated routing systems on 
the basis of retrieving an unranked set of docu- 
ments optimizing aspecific effectiveness measure. 
The results from these last 3 tracks were inconclu- 
sive, and should be viewed as a first-pass at these 
focussed tasks. 
There will be a fifth TREC conference in 1996, and 
most of the systems that participated in TREC-4 will 
be back, along with additional groups. The routing 
and adhoc tasks will be done again, with different 
data, and new topics similar in length to the TREC-3 
topics. In addition, all five tracks will be run again, 
with new data. The Multihngual track will be run 
with Spanish and, as a first time, with Chinese data 
and topics.
