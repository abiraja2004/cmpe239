Abstract
Given a parallel corpus, if two distinct words
in language A, a1 and a2, are aligned to the
same word b1 in language B, then this might
signal that b1 is polysemous, or it might sig-
nal a1 and a2 are synonyms. Both assump-
tions with successful work have been put for-
ward in the literature. We investigate these
assumptions, along with other questions of
word sense, by looking at sampled parallel
sentences containing tokens of the same type
in English, asking how often they mean the
same thing when they are: 1. aligned to the
same foreign type; and 2. aligned to different
foreign types. Results for French-English and
Chinese-English parallel corpora show simi-
lar behavior: Synonymy is only very weakly
the more prevalent scenario, where both cases
regularly occur.
1 Introduction
Parallel corpora have been used for both paraphrase
induction and word sense disambiguation (WSD).
Usually one of the following two assumptions is
made for these tasks:
1. Polysemy If two different words in language
A are aligned to the same word in language B,
then the word in language B is polysemous.
2. Synonymy If two different words in language
A are aligned to the same word in language B,
then the two words in A are synonyms, and thus
is not evidence of polysemy in B.
Despite the alternate nature of these assumptions,
both have associated articles in which a researcher
claimed success. Under the polysemy assumption,
Gale et al (1992) used French translations as En-
glish sense indicators in the task of WSD. For in-
stance, for the English word duty, the French transla-
tion droit was taken to signal its tax sense and devoir
to signal its obligation sense. These French words
were used as labels for different English senses.
Similarly, in a cross-lingual WSD setting,1 Lefever
et al (2011) treated each English-foreign alignment
as a so-called ParaSense, using it as a proxy for hu-
man labeled training data.
Under the synonymy assumption, Diab and
Resnik (2002) did word sense tagging by grouping
together all English words that are translated into
the same French word and by further enforcing that
the majority sense for these English words was pro-
jected as the sense for the French word. Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005) applied the idea that French
phrases aligned to the same English phrase are para-
phrases in a system that induces paraphrases by piv-
oting through aligned foreign phrases.
Based on this, and other successful prior work,
it seems neither of the assumptions must hold
universally. Therefore we investigate how often
we might expect one or the other to dominate:
we sample polysemous words from wide-domain
{French,Chinese}-English corpora, and use Ama-
zon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate word
sense on the English side. We calculate empirical
probabilities based on counting over the competing
polysemous and synonymous scenario labels.
A key factor deciding the validity of our conclu-
sion is the reliability of the annotations derived via
MTurk. Thus our first step is to evaluate the abil-
ity of Turkers to perform WSD. After verifying this
1E.g., given a sentence ?... more power, more duty ...?, the
task asks to give a French translation of duty, which should be
devior, after first recognizing the underlying obligation sense.

as a reasonable process for acquiring large amounts
of WSD labeled data, we go on to frame the experi-
mental design, giving final results in Sec. 4.
2 Turker Reliability
While Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has
been been considered in the past for constructing
lexical semantic resources (e.g., (Snow et al, 2008;
Akkaya et al, 2010; Parent and Eskenazi, 2010;
Rumshisky, 2011)), word sense annotation is sensi-
tive to subjectivity and usually achieves low agree-
ment rate even among experts. Thus we first asked
Turkers to re-annotate a sample of existing gold-
standard data. With an eye towards costs saving, we
also considered how many Turkers would be needed
per item to produce results of sufficient quality.
Turkers were presented sentences from the test
portion of the word sense induction task of
SemEval-2007 (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), covering
2,559 instances of 35 nouns, expert-annotated with
OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006) senses. Two versions
of the task were designed:
1. compare: given the same word in different
sentences, tell whether their meaning is THE
SAME, ALMOST THE SAME, UNLIKELY THE
SAME or DIFFERENT, where the results were
collapsed post-hoc into a binary same/different
categorization;
2. sense map: map the meaning of a given word
in a sentential context to its proper OntoNotes
definition.
For both tasks, 2, 599 examples were presented.
We measure inter-coder agreement using Krip-
pendorff?s Alpha (Krippendorff, 2004; Artstein and
Poesio, 2008), where ? ? 0.8 is considered to be
reliable and 0.667 ? ? < 0.8 allows for tenta-
tive conclusions. Two points emerge from Table 1:
there were greater agreement rates for sense map
than compare, and 3 Turkers were sufficient.
3 Experiment Design
Data Selection We used two parallel corpora: the
French-English 109 corpus (Callison-Burch et al,
2009) and the GALE Chinese-English corpus.

Subscripts denote either 5 Turkers, or 3 randomly se-
lected of the 5.
For each corpus we selected 50 words, w, at ran-
dom from OntoNotes,2 constrained such that w: had
more than one sense; had a frequency ? 1, 000; and
was not a top 10% most frequent words.
Next we sampled 100 instances (aligned English-
foreign sentence pairs) for each word based on the
following constraints: the aligned foreign word, f ,
had a frequency ? 20 in the foreign corpus; f had a
non-trivial alignment probability.3 We sampled pro-
portionally to the distribution of the aligned foreign
words, ensuring that at least 5 instances from each
foreign translation are sampled.4
For each corpus, this results in 100 instances for
each of 50 words, totaling 5,000 instances. We used
3 Turkers per instance for sense annotation, under
the sense map task. We note that the set of 50
randomly selected English words from the Chinese-
English corpus were entirely distinct from the 50 se-
lected words from the French-English corpus.
Probability Estimation Suppose e1 and e2 are
two tokens of the same English word type e. s(e1)
is a function that returns the sense of e1, a(e1) is
a function that returns the aligned word of e1. Let
c() be our count function, where: c(e, f) returns the

tives, owing to its coarse-grained sense definitions.
3Defined as f having index i < k when foreign words are
ranked by most probable given e, where k is the minimum value
such that
?k
i p(fi | e) > 0.8. E.g., if we have decreasing
probabilities p(droit | duty) = 0.6, p(devoir | duty) =
0.25, p(le | duty) = 0.03, ... then only consider droit and
devoir. This ruled out many noisy alignments.
4Thus, the instances of droit compared to that of devoir
would be 0.6/0.25.

number of times English word e is aligned to foreign
word f ; c(es, f) returns the number of times En-
glish word e has sense s (tagged by Turkers), when
aligned to foreign word f ; c(e) is the total number
of tokens of English word e; and c(es) is the number
of tokens of e with sense s.
We estimate from labeled data the probability of
three scenarios, with scenario 1 as our primary con-
cern: when two English words of the same poly-
semous type are aligned to different foreign word
types, what is the chance that they have the same
sense? Given the tokens e1 and e2, we calculate P1
as follows:
P1e = P (s(e1) = s(e2) | a(e1) 6= a(e2))
?
?
s c
2(es)?
?
s,f c
2(es, f)
c2(e)?
?
f c2(e, f)
P1 says that given two words of the same type
(e1 and e2) that are not aligned to the same foreign
word type (a(e1) 6= a(e2)), what is the probabil-
ity that they have the same sense (s(e1) = s(e2)).
We approach this estimation combinatorially. For
instance, the number of ways to choose two words
of the same type is
( 2
c(e)
)
? 12c
2(e) when c(e) is
large.
A large value of P1 would be in support of Syn-
onymy, as the two foreign aligned words of distinct
type would have the same meaning.
Scenario 2 asks: given two English words of
the same polysemous type and aligned to the same
words (a(e1) = a(e2)), what is the probability that
they have the same sense (s(e1) = s(e2))?
P2e = P (s(e1) = s(e2) | a(e1) = a(e2))
?
?
s,f c
2(es, f)
?
f c2(e, f)
Finally, what is the probability of two tokens of
the same polysemous type agreeing when alignment
information is not known (e.g., without a parallel
corpus)?
P3e = P (s(e1) = s(e2)) ?

All the above equations are given per English word
type e. In later sections we report the average values
over multiple word types and their counts.
4 Results
Turker Experiments To minimize errors from
Turkers, for every HIT we inserted one control
sentence taken from the example sentences of
OntoNotes. Turker results with either extremely low
finishing time (<10s), or average accuracy on con-
trol sentences lower than accuracy by chance, were
rejected. On average Turkers took 185 seconds to
map 10 sentences in a HIT to their OntoNotes def-
inition, receiving $0.10 per HIT. The total time for
annotating 5000 sentences was 22 hours.
Turkers had no knowledge about alignments: we
hid the aligned French/Chinese sentences from them
and these sentences were later processed to compute
P1/2/3 values. Two foreign tokens aligned with the
same source type correspond to two senses of the
same type. To give an estimate of alignment errors,
we manually examined 1/10 of all 5000 sampled
Chinese-English alignments at random and found
only 3 of them were wrong: all due to that English
content words were aligned to common Chinese
function words. This error rate is much lower than
that typically reported by alignment tools. The main
reason is explained in footnote 3: foreign words with
trivial alignment probability were removed before
calculating P1/2/3 values. Thus we believe the align-
ment was reliable.
Probability Estimation Table 2 gives the dis-
tribution of senses and word types in the sam-
pled words. Take the second numeric column of
French-English as an example: out of 50 words ran-
domly sampled, 9 have 2 distinct sense definitions
in OntoNotes. However, 17 of 50 unique word types
had exactly 2 distinct senses annotated, out of the
100 examples of a given word type: 17 words had
2 distinct senses observed. Of the 9 words with 2
official senses, on average 1.9 of those senses were
observed.
Table 3 and Figures 1 and 2 shows the result for
P1, P2 and P3 using the {French,Chinese}-English
corpora, calculated based on the majority vote of
three Turkers. High P2 values suggests that for two
tokens of the same type, aligning to the same for-
eign type is a reasonable indicator of having the
same meaning. When working with open domain
corpora, without foreign alignments, the probabil-
ity of two English words of the same type having

identical meaning is estimated here to be roughly
59-67% (59.2% (French), 66.7% (Chinese)). This
accords with results from WSD evaluations, where
the first-sense heuristic is roughly 75-80% accu-
rate (e.g., 80.9% in SemEval?07 (Brody and Lap-
ata, 2009)). Minor algebra translates this into an ex-
pected P3 value in a range from 56%?62.5%, up to
64%? 68%, which captures our estimates.5
Finally for our motivating scenario: values for P1
are barely higher than 50%, suggesting that Syn-
onymy more regularly holds, but not conclusively.
We expect in narrower domains, where words have
less number of senses, this is more noticeable. As
suggested by Fig.s 1 and 2, less polysemous words
tend to have higher P values.
5 Conclusion
Curious as to the distinct threads of prior work based
on alternate assumptions of word sense and parallel
corpora, we derived empirical expectations on the
shared meaning of tokens of the same type appear-
ing in the same corpus. Our results suggest neither
the assumption of Polysemy nor Synonymy holds
significantly more often than the other, at least for
individual words (as opposed to phrases) and for the
open domain corpora used here. Further, we provide
an independent data point that supports earlier find-
ings as to the expected accuracy of the first sense
heuristic in word sense disambiguation.
5Assuming worst case: no two tokens that are not the first
sense ever match, and best case: any two tokens not the first
sense always match, then assuming first-sense accuracy of 0.8
gives a range on P3 of: (0.82, 0.82 + 0.22) = (0.64, 0.68).
