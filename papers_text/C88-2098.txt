A large <lictionary database is tm important conq>onent of a uat.. 
nral langl~age processing systmn. We already kuov+ sy'~dac~ic ill.- 
tbrm:~tion which should be and can be stored in a large dictionary 
d ~tabase for ~ practical application such as a machine hanslatiou 
system, tlowever, we still need 'more research on :;emanlic intbr- 
m~tion which can be prepared for a large system. As a first step 
to construct ~ large scale semantic dictionary (lexical knowledge 
base) the authors of this paper have inspected a machine read- 
able ordinary English dictionary LDOCE, Longrnan l)ictionary 
of Contempo,:ary English, 1.978 edition \[Procter 1987\]. 
Extr~m{ing semantic information ti'om an ordinary dictionary 
is ~n interesting research topic. One of the o~ims of automatic ex-- 
traction is to produce a thesaurus. No'~l, for example, proposed 
the idea of thesaurus production fl'om LDOCE in \[No~l 1982\]. 
Amsler also showed the result of automatic thesaurus production 
from a techniaeal encyclopedia \[Amsler 1987\]. Boguraev and AI-- 
shawi have st ~ldied the. utilization of LDOCE for natural language 
proce~,:sfing re'.;earches in geuerM \[Alshwai 1987,Bognraev 1987\]. 
in this paper, the automatic extraction of scntantic reh~tion- 
ships between words l?om I,DOCE is described. For the ex-- 
traction, the m~gnctic tape version of 1,1)OCE is loaded into 
relational d~.tabase system. Developc~ extraction programs ana- 
lyze the definition sentence in LDOCE with a pattern matddng 
ba~d algorithm. Since this algorithm is not perfect, the result 
of the extrac;;ion ha'~ been compared with semantic information 
(sem~mtic markers) which the magnetic t~pe version of bDOCF, 
co~rtains. The result of comparison is also discussed ibr evaluat- 
ing the reliaLility of such ~n automatic extraction. 
,~ ~,DB Vers ion  of  LDOCE 
hi genera.l, a dictionary consists of a complex dat~ structure: 
various relationships between words; grammatical information; 
usage l~otes, etc. '\['here.fore, we need a special database ma.nage- 
mer*t sy.~tem to handle dictionary data. l, br inst~nme, \[Nag~m 1980\] 
shows mlch a system for retrieving a Japanese dictionary. In this 
pa.per, however, the anthors are mainly interested in tile defini- 
tion and tile sample sentence parts of I,I)()(?E, ira;read of com- 
plex relati, ms among inlbrmation in the dictionary. 
For the sake of efticiency (including the cost of sy:;i.cm dc  
vetopment) of \[,DOCE retrieval, we have decided to u,';e a cow 
ventional relational databa.~;e management system (I{I)BM). 'iFhe 
Ii.DBM which we use is running on the rnaiafr~mm eomputel of 
Kyoto University Data Proce~ing Center (Fujitsu M782, (),q/IV 
l"4 MSP, FACOM AIM/RDB). 
For loading the magnetic version of LDOCE into this t\[I)li/i\[VI, 
we have extracted the following fields from I,I)OCI,;: 
1. IIead Word (IIW); 2. Part-.of-Speech (PS); 3. Deft- 
nition Number (DN); 4. Grammar (?ode (GC); 5. Box 
Code (BC); 6. Definition (Die); and 7. ~~trnt)le Se.w 
tence (SP). 
The Box Code field contains various information such as semantic 
restrictions, etc, which are explained in section 4.1. 
The fields I through 5 are ahnost tile same as the origi-. 
hal LDOCE data. (Several special characters are removed or 
changed into standard characters for simplicity of retrieval. The 
syllable division mark (.) is removed. Some of the font control 
characters are changed into '< '  and '>.') 
'l'he definitions and the sample sentences are separated into 
a clause or a sentence. For example, definition 1 of the verb to 
abandon is: 
to leave completely ~md tbr ever; desert 
in the originM data. This definition is transfl)rmed into Lwo set)- 
state ebmses in the RI)B version: 
1. to leave completely and for ever 
2. desert. 
Since every data in the RDB is repres(mted in a tabular 
form, we have made three t~bles for the RDB version of I,\])OCF, 
(I,DOCE/RDB, see table I regarding their its record format): 
4'59 
t. Grammar Code and Box Code 'Fable (LDB.D1). 
2. Definition Table (LDB.D2, see table 2). 
3. Sample Sentence Table (LDB.D3). 
3 Extra(:t ion of Semant ic  In format ion 
One form of semantic information useful for natural language 
processing is a thesaurus (or semantic network), which basically 
describes emantic relations between words. "1'o automatically 
produce the thesaurus from LDOCE, two programs have been 
dcveloped: 
1. Key Verb extraction progra m. 
'2. Key Noun and Function Noun extraction program. 
These programs and the result of extraction are discussed in this 
section. 
3 . i  Key  Verb  Ext rac t ion  P rogram 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: 
to VERB ... 
Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the 
defined verb. Therefore, we c,.U this VERB a Key Verb. 
For example, the verbs semantically related to the verb t0 hit 
have the tollowing definitions: 
e strike: to hit

* beat: to hit many times, esp. with a stick 
? kick: to hit with the foot 
? knee: to hi~ with the knee 
From this pattern of definitions, we can draw figm'e 1 which 
shows the semantic hierarchy around to kit: to beat, ~o kick and 
lo knee are specialized verbs of to kit 
~Ib expand this hierarchy, a program to extract he key verbs 
from a definition is developed. Table 3 (LDBV.D2) shows some 
examples of this extraction. In table 4, the frequency of key verbs 
is listed. Most frequently used key verb is l0 make. Note that 
~o make and to cause are used to define causative and transitive 
verbs respectively.

'lYaveming these relations between delined verb and key verb, 
a thesaurus (network) of verbs has been obtained approximately. 
Most of the verbs in this tlu.~uurus make s tree-like structure 
shown in figure 1. Ilowever, several 'loops' are found. A 'loop' 
exprea~es a cyclic definition: ~o welcome is defined by t0 greet, 
and to greet is defined by lo welcome. In the network, six typical 
cyclic definitions are: 
do :  do (the verb to do does not have a key verb.) 
cha~tge: dtange, move~ come, become 
~ go: go, leave 
get: get, receive 
stop:: stop, cease 
o let: let, allow, permit 
Note that there are many other cyclic definitions in the network. 
However, most of them have a link to another verb; at least one 
of the verb in a cyclic definitions is defined by another verb. 
Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of 
these verbs only from the dictionary, these may be a kind of bug 
of the dictionary. However, these cyclically defined verbs seem to 
correspond to semanlic primitives, which are first introduced to 
AI works by \[Sehank 1975\]. Semantic primitives may be defined 
outside of linfuislic words. Details of the result of extraction are 
discussed in \[Nakamura 1986\]. 
3o2 Key  Noun and  Funct ion  Noun Ext rac t ion  
P rogram 
We cau apply a similar algorithm to definitions of nouns, al- 
though the pattern of definitions of nouns is mo~e complex than 
that of verbs, ln~ct ing  definitions with LDOCE/ttDB, most 
of them a~e, classified into two forms: 
1. {determiner} {adjective}* \]Key Noun {adjective phrase}* 
2. {determiner} {adjective}* le-hnction Noun of Key Noun 
{adjective phrase}* 
The first one is a simple form and many of them express is-a 
relations between a defined:noun and a key noun. For example, 
abandon: the w~aSe when one's feelings sad actions 
axe u;acontroIled 
shows that 
abandon is-a slate. 
The second form expresses more complex ~mantic relations 
between ouns. 
abbey: the group of people living in such a building 
shows that 
abbey is-a-group-of people. 
A function noun, therefore, explicitly expresses the semantic re- 
lation between a head word and a key noun. 
With terras of a semantic network, defined nouns aml key 
nouns are nodes in a semantic network, and function nouns 
(when function noun is empty, its function noun is regared ~ 
kind) expre~ the name of a link between odes. The following 
nouns (41 nouns, in total) are considered to be function nouns, 
which are mannally extracted. 
is-a: kind, type, ... 
o part-of:  part, side, top, ... 
member~shlp:  set, member, group, class, family, ... 
? action: act, way, action, ... 
state: state, condition, ... 
amount :  amount, sum, measure, ... 
degree:  degree, quality, ... 
? form: form, shape, ... 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns from the 
definitions of nouns is developed, rl~ble 5 shows a part of the key 
noun and fmtction noun table in the LI)OCE/RI)B (LDBN.D2) 
generated by this program. 
As shown in table 6, the key noun of highest frequency is 
person (2174 times) and for function noun is type (1064 times) 
except null function noun (pattern 1). 
'lYaversing is-a relation, for example, a thesaurus has been 
obtained \[Nakamura 1987\]. Table 7 shows a part of the autmnat- 
ically obtained thesaurus, whose 'root' word is person: actor is 
a-kind-of person; comedian, ezlra, ham, and mime are a-kind-of 
actor; comedienne is a-kind-of comedian. 
4 Comparison between Result  of Ex- 
tract ion and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key 
verb extraction programs is all approximate one, and, obviously, 
contains everal errors. The key noun of abbreviation 1, for ex- 
ample, is shorler in table 5, because the current program ignores 
ing-formed words. However, it should be making. (Even if we 
(:hanged the extraction algorithm, still we have a problem that 
making is not a simple noun, but a gerund. We need to define 
noun-verb semantic relations.) To evaluate the quality of the 
produced thesaurus, the noun part of the thesaurus has been 
compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.

For example, there are 597 nouns whose function noun is ilct, 
and 584 nouns (97%) of them are marked as 'abstract'; there are 
398 nouns whose function noun is state, and 391 nouns (98%) 
of them are 'abstract.' The distinction between <state' and 'act', 
h)r instance, is useful for natural anguage processing in general. 
4.4 Nouns  Marked  as ' Inan imate '  
Some 'Inanimate' nouns are correctly identified in the produced 
thesaurus (table 11). Especially, 39% of nouns under the noun 
liquid have 'Liquid' markers, and 56~ of nmms under the noun 
gas have 'Gas' markers. 
However, many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance 
in LDOCE. Sub-classification f these noun is expr(~sed with a 
compound word (or an adjective) as shown in table 11: coke is a 
solid substance; f luorine is a non-metallic substance. Since the 
currect extraction program does not handle a compound word, 
the thesaurus cannot express these classification. 
4.5 Other  Typ ica l  Nouns  
Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also com- 
pared with markers of LDOCE. Because the current system can.- 
not distinguish senses of nouns, nouns which have several differ- 
ent senses causes a problem. A typical example is found in the 
definitions whose key noun is case. As shown in table 12, altache 
ease and tesl ease are both defined by case; these expr~ses corn 
pletely different concept. In 30 nouns whose key noun is case,

type a type of coarse woolen cloth woven form 
threads of several different colours 
16 nouns are 'movable (J)', and 14 nouns are 'absTract.' 
Difficulity of semantic marking is also found. For example, 
lexicographers could not mark 'movable (J)' and 'Solid' system- 
atically. For example, some nouns whose key noun is cloth are 
marked as 'Solid', and others are marked as 'movable (J)' (ta- 
ble 13). This is a problem in gathering of semantic information 
itself. 
5 Conclusion 
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns 
from LDOCE is discussed. Data from the magnetic version of 
LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for sim- 
plicity of retrieving. For the extraction of semantic relations, 
programs to find key verb, key noun, and function noun have 
been developed. Using these programs, the thesaurus i  auto- 
matically produced. 
? b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced the- 
saurus, it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE. Al- 
though the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the 
difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts, the comparison be- 
tween the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE 
shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.
