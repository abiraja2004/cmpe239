Abstract
We conduct a pilot study for task-oriented
evaluation of Multiword Expression (MWE)
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We
propose two different integration strategies for
MWE in SMT, which take advantage of differ-
ent degrees of MWE semantic compositional-
ity and yield complementary improvements in
SMT quality on a large-scale translation task.1
1 Introduction
A multiword expression (MWE) generally refers to
a multiword unit or a collocation of words that co-
occur together statistically more than chance. A
MWE is a cover term for different types of colloca-
tions which vary in their transparency and fixedness.
Identifying MWEs and understanding their meaning
is considered essential to language understanding,
and of crucial importance for any Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications that aim at handling
robust language meaning and use. In fact, the sem-
inal paper (Sag et al, 2002) refers to this problem
as a key issue for the development of high-quality
NLP applications. (Villavicencio et al, 2005) iden-
tify Machine Translation as an application of partic-
ular interest since ? recognition of MWEs is neces-
sary for systems to preserve the meaning and pro-
duce appropriate translations and avoid the genera-
tion of unnatural or nonsensical sentences in the tar-
get language.?
However, statistical machine translation (SMT)
typically does not model MWEs explicitly. SMT

DARPA GALE project.
units are typically phrasal translations, defined with-
out any direct syntactic or lexical semantic motiva-
tion: they are simply n-grams that are consistently
translated in parallel corpora. Phrasal translations
might indirectly capture MWEs, but they are not dis-
tinguished from any other n-gram.
As a result, the usefulness of explicitly modeling
MWEs in the SMT framework has not yet been stud-
ied systematically. Previous work has focused on
automatically learning and integrating translations
of very specific MWE categories, such as, for in-
stance, idiomatic Chinese four character expressions
(Bai et al, 2009) or domain specific MWEs (Ren et
al., 2009). MWEs have also been defined not from
a lexical semantics perspective but from a SMT er-
ror reduction perspective, as phrases that are hard
to align during SMT training (Lambert and Banchs,
2005). For each of these particular cases, translation
quality improved by augmenting the SMT transla-
tion lexicon with the learned bilingual MWEs either
directly or through improved word alignments.
In this paper, we consider a more general prob-
lem: we view SMT as an extrinsic evaluation of
the usefulness of monolingual MWEs as used per-
vasively in natural language regardless of domain,
idiomaticity and compositionality. A MWE is com-
positional if its meaning as a unit can be predicted
from the meaning of its component words such as in
make a decision meaning to decide. Some MWEs
are more predictable than others, for instance, kick
the bucket, when used idiomatically to mean to die,
has nothing in common with the literal meaning of
either kick or bucket, while make a decision is very
clearly related to to decide. These expressions are
242
both considered MWEs but have varying degrees of
compositionality and predictability.
We explore strategies for integrating all MWEs
along this continuum in SMT. Given a monolingual
MWE lexicon, we propose (1) a static integration
strategy that segments training and test sentences ac-
cording to the MWE vocabulary, and (2) a dynamic
integration strategy that adds a new MWE-based
feature in SMT translation lexicons.
In a pilot study of the impact of WordNet MWEs
on a large-scale English to Arabic SMT system, we
show that static and dynamic strategies both improve
translation quality and that their impact is not the
same for different types of MWEs. This suggests
that the proposed framework would be an interest-
ing testbed for a task-driven evaluation of automatic
MWE extraction.
2 Static integration of MWE in SMT
The first strategy for integration can be seen as
a generalization of word segmentation for MWEs.
Given a MWE lexicon, we identify MWEs in run-
ning text and turn them into a single unit by un-
derscoring. We call this integration method static,
since, once segmented, all MWEs are considered
frozen from the perspective of the SMT system.
During training and decoding, MWEs are handled
as distinct words regardless of their compositional-
ity, and all knowledge of the MWE components is
lost.
3 Dynamic integration of MWE in SMT
The second strategy attempts to encourage cohesive
translations of MWEs without ignoring their com-
ponents. Word alignment and phrasal translation
extraction are conducted without any MWE knowl-
edge, so that the SMT system can learn word-for-
word translations from consistently translated com-
positional MWEs. MWE knowledge is integrated as
a feature in the translation lexicon. For each entry,
in addition to the standard phrasal translation proba-
bilities, we define a count feature that represents the
number of MWEs in the input language phrase.
We refer to this integration strategy as dynamic,
because the SMT system decides at decoding time
how to segment the input sentence. The MWE fea-
ture biases the system towards using phrases that do
not break MWEs. This can be seen as a generaliza-
tion of the binary MWE feature in (Ren et al, 2009),
repurposed for monolingual MWEs.
4 Empirical Evaluation
We evaluate the impact of MWEs in SMT on a large-
scale English-Arabic translation task.
Using two languages from different families is a
challenging testbed for MWEs in SMT. In contrast,
very closely related languages such as English and
French might present less divergence in lexicaliza-
tion.
In addition, Arabic-English is a well-studied lan-
guage pair in SMT, with large amounts of data avail-
able. However, we tackle the less common English
to Arabic direction in order to take advantage of the
rich lexical resources available for English on the in-
put side.
Our test set consists of the 813 newswire sen-
tences of the 2008 NIST Open Machine Transla-
tion Evaluation, which is standard evaluation data
for Arabic-English translation. The first English ref-
erence translation is used as the input to our SMT
system, and the single Arabic translation is used as
the unique reference2. Translation quality is eval-
uated using two automatic evaluation metrics: (1)
BLEUr1n4 (Papineni et al, 2002), which is based
on n-gram precisions for n = 1..4, and (2) Trans-
lation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al, 2006), which
generalizes edit distance beyond single-word edits.
4.1 SMT system
We use the open-source Moses toolkit (Koehn et al,
2007) to build a standard phrase-based SMT system.
Our training data consists of 2.5M sentence pairs
from mostly newswire parallel corpora distributed
by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The English
side is tokenized using simple punctuation-based
rules. The Arabic side is segmented according to the
Arabic Treebank v3 tokenization scheme using the
MADA+TOKAN morphological analyzer and tok-
enizer (Habash et al, 2009).
The parallel corpus is word-aligned using
GIZA++ in both translation directions, which are

optimal as a reference translation.

combined by intersection and the grow-diag-final-
and heuristic (Koehn et al, 2007). Phrase transla-
tions of up to 10 words are extracted in the Moses
phrase-table. We use a 5-gram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Feature weights
are tuned on NIST-MT06.
4.2 English MWE
Our main source of English MWE is the WordNet
3.0 lexical database (Fellbaum, 1998). We use sim-
ple rules to augment WordNet entries with morpho-
logical variations (e.g., keep one?s eyes peeled is ex-
panded into keep her eyes peeled, etc.). In addi-
tion when marking MWEs in text, we allow matches
not only with surface forms, but also with lemma-
tized forms (Schmid, 1994) to account for inflec-
tions. This results in a total of about 900 MWE to-
kens and 500 types in our evaluation test set. MWE
identification in running text is performed using a
straightforward maximum forward match algorithm.
Second, in order to contrast the impact of MWEs
with that of frequent collocations in our dynamic in-
tegration strategy, we consider the top 500 most fre-
quent n-grams from the SMT test set, so that the
same number of n-gram types and WordNet MWEs
are marked in the test set. Unlike WordNet MWEs,
these n-gram represent cohesive units, but are not
necessarily frozen or even a single concept. We con-
sider n-grams up to length 10 from the phrase-table,
and compute their frequency in the English side of
the parallel corpus. The top 500 most frequent n-
grams and the WordNet MWEs yield two very dif-
ferent lexicons. Only the following 10 entries ap-
pear in both: at the same time, deputy prime minis-
ter, for the first time, in the south, in the wake of, in-
ternational atomic energy agency, islamic resistance
movement, on the other hand, osama bin laden, sec-
retary of state.
5 Static MWE Integration Improves SMT
As seen in Table 1, the static integration of the Word-
Net MWE lexicon by segmentation of English train-
ing and test sentences improves BLEU and TER
compared to the SMT baseline. This suggests that
WordNet MWEs represent useful units of meaning
for alignment and translation into Arabic despite the
fact that they are monolingually defined.

Top 500 n-grams dynamic 59.07 30.98
WordNet MWE dynamic 58.89 31.07
WordNet MWE static 58.98 31.27
Table 1: Impact of MWE integration measured on NIST
MT08
Consider, for instance, the following input sen-
tence: the special envoy of the secretary-general will
submit an oral report to the international security
council rather than a written report. With static in-
tegration, the MWE written report is correctly trans-
lated as tqryrA mktwbA, while the baseline produces
the incorrect translation ktb Altqryr (writing the re-
port or book of report).
6 Dynamic MWE Integration Improves
SMT
Dynamic integration of the WordNet MWE lexicon
and the top 500 n-grams both improve BLEU and
TER (Table 1), but WordNet MWEs yield slightly
better scores. This confirms the ability of the dy-
namic integration method to handle compositional
MWEs, since the most frequent n-grams are highly
compositional by definition.
7 Discussion
At the corpus-level, static integration yields a
slightly better BLEU score than dynamic with
WordNet MWEs, while the opposite effect is ob-
served on TER. This suggests that the two integra-
tion strategies impact translation in different ways.
Sentence-level scores indeed reveal that dynamic
and static integration strategies have an opposite im-
pact on 27% of the test set (Table 2).
For instance, the dynamic approach fails for
phrasal verbs such as take out. In who were then
allowed to take out as many unsecured loans as they
wanted, take out is realized as b+ AlHSwl (acquire)
with the static approach, while it is entirely dropped
from the dynamic translation.
In the static approach, translation quality is often
degraded when our simple dictionary matching ap-
proach incorrectly detects MWE. For instance, in the
sentence the perpetration of this heinous act on our

soil, act on is incorrectly identified as a MWE which
degrades translation fluency. This suggests that fur-
ther gains in translation quality could be obtained
with a more sophisticated MWE detection method.
8 Conclusion
We have proposed a framework of two comple-
mentary integration strategies for MWEs in SMT,
which allows extrinsic evaluation of the usefulness
of MWEs of varying degree of compositionality.
We conducted a pilot study using manually defined
WordNet MWE and a dictionary matching approach
to MWE detection. This simple model improves
English-Arabic translation quality, even on a large
SMT system trained on more than 2 Million sen-
tence pairs.
This result suggests that standard SMT phrases
do not implicitly capture all useful MWE informa-
tion. It would therefore be interesting to conduct
this study on a larger scale, using more general
MWE definitions such as automatically learned col-
locations (Smadja, 1993) or verb-noun constructions
(Diab and Bhutada, 2009).
