Abstract
In view of the increasing need to facilitate
processing the content of scientific papers,
we present an annotation scheme for anno-
tating full papers with zones of conceptu-
alisation, reflecting the information struc-
ture and knowledge types which constitute
a scientific investigation. The latter are the
Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSCs) and
include Hypothesis, Motivation, Goal, Ob-
ject, Background, Method, Experiment,
Model, Observation, Result and Conclu-
sion. The CoreSC scheme has been used
to annotate a corpus of 265 full papers in
physical chemistry and biochemistry and
we are currently automating the recogni-
tion of CoreSCs in papers. We discuss
how the CoreSC scheme relates to other
views of scientific papers and indeed how
the former could be used to help identify
negation and speculation in scientific texts.
1 Introduction
The recent surge in the numbers of papers pro-
duced, especially in the biosciences, has high-
lighted the need for automatic processing meth-
ods. Work by [Lin (2009)] has shown that methods
such as information retrieval are more effective if
zones of interest are specified within the papers.
Various corpora and annotation schemes have
been proposed for designating a variety of linguis-
tic phenomena permeating scientific papers, in-
cluding negation, hedges, dependencies and se-
mantic relations [Vincze et al (2008); Pyysalo
et al (2007); Medlock and Briscoe (2007); McIn-
tosh and Curran (2009)]. Other schemes follow
the argumentation and citation flow within pa-
pers [Teufel et al (2009); Teufel and Siddharthan
(2007)] or indeed a combination of some of the
above along multiple dimensions [Shatkay et al
(2008)].
In the following we present the CoreSC anno-
tation scheme and a corpus with CoreSC anno-
tations. The CoreSC scheme is used at the sen-
tence level to identify the core components that
constitute a scientific investigation. We discuss
how the CoreSC scheme relates to other annota-
tion schemes representing alternate views of sci-
entific papers and how CoreSCs could be used to
guide the identification of negation and specula-
tion.
2 The CoreSC scheme
The CoreSC annotation scheme adopts the view
that a scientific paper is the human-readable repre-
sentation of a scientific investigation and therefore
seeks to mark the components of a scientific
investigation as expressed in the text. CoreSC
is ontology-motivated and originates from the
CISP meta-data [Soldatova and Liakata (2007)],
a subset of classes from EXPO [Soldatova and
King (2006)], an ontology for the description of
scientific investigations. CISP consists of the con-
cepts: Motivation, Goal, Object, Method,
Experiment, Observation, Result and
Conclusion, which were validated using an
on-line survey as constituting the indispensable
set of concepts necessary for the description of
a scientific investigation. CoreSC implements
these as well as Hypothesis, Model and
Background, as a sentence-based annotation
scheme for 3-layered annotation. The first layer
pertains to the previously mentioned 11 cate-
gories, the second layer is for the annotation of
properties of the concepts (e.g. ?New?, ?Old?)
and the third layer caters for identifiers (concep-
tID), which link together instances of the same
concept, e.g. all the sentences pertaining to the
same method will be linked together with the
same conceptID (e.g. ?Met1?).
If we combine the layers of annotation so as to

Table 1: The CoreSC Annotation scheme
Category Description
Hypothesis A statement not yet confirmed rather than a factual statement
Motivation The reasons behind an investigation
Background Generally accepted background knowledge and previous work
Goal A target state of the investigation where intended discoveries are made
Object-New An entity which is a product or main theme of the investigation
Object-New-Advantage Advantage of an object
Object-New-Disadvantage Disadvantage of an object
Method-New Means by which authors seek to achieve a goal of the investigation
Method-New-Advantage Advantage of a Method
Method-New-Disadvantage Disadvantage of a Method
Method-Old A method mentioned pertaining to previous work
Method-Old-Advantage Advantage of a Method
Method-Old-Disadvantage Disadvantage of a Method
Experiment An experimental method
Model A statement about a theoretical model or framework
Observation the data/phenomena recorded in an investigation
Result factual statements about the outputs of an investigation
Conclusion statements inferred from observations & results relating to research hypothesis
give flat labels, we cater for the categories in table
1.
The CoreSC scheme was accompanied by a set of
45 page guidelines which contain a decision tree,
detailed description of the semantics of the cate-
gories, 6 rules for pairwise distinction and exam-
ples from chemistry papers. These guidelines are
available from http://ie-repository.jisc.ac.uk/88/.
3 The CoreSC corpus
We used the CoreSC annotation scheme and the
semantic annotation tool SAPIENT [Liakata et al
(2009)] to construct a corpus of 265 annotated pa-
pers [Liakata and Soldatova (2009)] from physi-
cal chemistry and biochemistry. The CoreSC cor-
pus was developed in two different phases. Dur-
ing phase I, fifteen Chemistry experts were split
into five groups of three, each of which anno-
tated eight different papers; A 16th expert anno-
tated across groups as a consistency check. This
resulted in a total of 41 papers being annotated,
all of which received multiple annotations. We
ranked annotators according to median success in
terms of inter-annotator agreement (as measured
by Cohen?s kappa) both within their groups and
for a paper common across groups. In phase II,
the 9 best annotators of phase I each annotated 25
papers, amounting to a total of 225 papers.
The CoreSC corpus is now being used to train
a classifier for the automation of Core Scientific
concepts in papers.
4 Correlating CoreSCs to other zones of
interest
Given the plethora of annotation schemes, it is in-
teresting to investigate the correlation between dif-
ferent views of scientific papers and how different
schemes map to each other. We recently looked
at the correlation between the CoreSC scheme,
which views papers as the humanly readable rep-
resentation of scientific investigations and seeks
to recover the investigation components within the
paper, and AZ-II [Teufel et al (2009)], which as-
sumes a paper is the attempt of claiming owner-
ship for a new piece of knowledge and aims to
recover the rhetorical structure and the relevant
stages in the argumentation.
By definition, the two schemes focus on differ-
ent aspects of the papers, with CoreSCs provid-
ing more detail with respect to different types of
methods and results and AZ-II looking mostly at
the appropriation of knowledge claims. Based on
a set of 36 papers annotated with both schemes,
we were able to confirm that the two schemes
are indeed complementary [Liakata et al (2010)].
CoreSC categories provide a greater level of gran-
ularity when it comes to the content-related cate-
gories whereas AZ-II categories cover aspects of
the knowledge claims that permeate across differ-
ent CoreSC concepts.
In [Guo et al (2010)] we followed a simi-
lar methodology for annotating abstracts with
CoreSCs and an independently produced annota-
tion scheme for abstract sections [Hirohata et al
(2008)]. We found a subsumption relation be-
tween the schemes, with CoreSCs providing the
2
finer granularity.
To obtain the mapping between annotation
schemes, which allows annotation schemes to be
defined in a wider context, we ideally require an-
notations from different schemes to be made avail-
able for the same set of papers. However, a first
interpretation of the relation between schemes can
be made by mapping between annotation guide-
lines.
5 Thoughts on using CoreSCs for
Negation and Speculation
Current work of ours involves automating the
recognition of CoreSCs and we plan to use them
to produce extractive summaries for papers. We
are also in the process of evaluating the usefulness
of CoreSCs for Cancer Risk Assessment (CRA).
An important aspect of the latter is being able
to distinguish between positive and negative re-
sults and assess the confidence in any conclusions
drawn. This naturally leads us to the need for ex-
ploring negation and speculation, both of which
are prominent in scientific papers, as well as how
these two phenomena correlate to CoreSCs.
While it seems that negation can be identified
by means of certain linguistic patterns [Morante
(2010)], different types of negation can appear
throughout the paper, some pertaining to back-
ground work, problems serving as the motivation
of the paper, others referring to intermediate re-
sults or conclusions. It is interesting to look at
these different types of negation in the context of
each of the different CoreSCs, the type of linguis-
tic patterns used to express it and their distribution
across CoreSCs. This can provide a more target-
ted approach to negation, while at the same time it
can be used in combination with a CoreSC to infer
the type of knowledge obtained (e.g. a positive or
negative result). We plan to use automatic meth-
ods for recognising negation patterns in CoreSCs
and relate them to specific CoreSC categories.
There is a consensus that identifying specula-
tion is a harder task than identifying negation.
Part of the problem is that ?speculative assertions
are to be identified on the basis of the judge-
ments about the author?s intended meaning, rather
than on the presence of certain designated hedge
terms? [Medlock and Briscoe (2007); Light et al
(2004)]. When annotating papers with CoreSCs,
annotators are required to understand the paper
content rather than base category assignments en-
tirely on linguistic patterns. This is why we have
chosen experts as annotators for the creation of
the CoreSC corpus. So both speculation and
CoreSC annotation appear to be higher level an-
notation tasks requiring comprehension of the in-
tended meaning. Looking at the annotation guide-
lines for hedges [Medlock and Briscoe (2007)],
it would seem that cases of hedge type 1 corre-
spond to to CoreSC Conclusion, hedge type
2 pertains to Background, hedge type 3 would
mainly be cases of Motivation, hedge type 4
maps to Motivation or Hypothesis, hedge
type 5 maps to Goal and hedge type 6 maps to
Conclusion. One can look at speculation in the
zones/windows identified by the previously men-
tioned CoreSCs. Indeed, two of the categories,
Hypothesis and Motivation are speculative
by definition. We intend to port the issue of iden-
tifying speculation in our papers to that of identi-
fying the corresponding CoreSCs. We also plan to
annotate the hedge classification data of [Medlock
and Briscoe (2007)] with CoreSCs to confirm the
mapping between the two schemes.
