Abstract
Cultural heritage institutions are making their
digital content available and searchable on-
line. Digital metadata descriptions play an im-
portant role in this endeavour. This metadata
is mostly manually created and often lacks de-
tailed annotation, consistency and, most im-
portantly, explicit semantic content descrip-
tors which would facilitate online browsing
and exploration of available information. This
paper proposes the enrichment of existing
cultural heritage metadata with automatically
generated semantic content descriptors. In
particular, it is concerned with metadata en-
coding archival descriptions (EAD) and pro-
poses to use automatic term recognition and
term clustering techniques for knowledge ac-
quisition and content-based document classi-
fication purposes.
1 Introduction
The advent of the digital age has long changed the
processes and the media which cultural heritage in-
stitutions (such as libraries, archives and museums)
apply for describing and cataloguing their objects:
electronic cataloguing systems support classification
and search, while cultural heritage objects are asso-
ciated to digital metadata content descriptions. The
expansion of the web and the increasing engagement
of web users throughout the world has brought about
the need for cultural heritage institutions to make
their content available and accessible to a wider au-
dience online.
In this endeavour, cultural heritage institutions
face numerous challenges. In terms of metadata,
different metadata standards currently exist for de-
scribing various types of objects, both within the
same institution and across different institutions.
Moreover, metadata object descriptions have been
typically both created by and addressed to librar-
ian and archivist experts who have been expected
to assist visitors in their search. For this reason,
they primarily refer to bibliographic descriptions
(e.g. author/creator, title, etc.), or physical descrip-
tions (e.g. size, shape, material, etc.), and location.
The lack of semantic descriptors in this type of meta-
data makes it difficult for potential online visitors to
browse and explore available information based on
more intuitive content criteria.
Work on metadata in cultural heritage institu-
tions has been largely focused on the issue of meta-
data heterogeneity. There have been efforts towards
the development and adoption of collection-specific
metadata standards, such as MARC 21 (Library of
Congress, 2010) and EAD (Library of Congress,
2002), for library and archival material respectively,
which are intended to standardise metadata descrip-
tions across different institutions. To address the is-
sue of heterogeneity across different types of object
collections, generic metadata schemas have been
proposed, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initia-
tive (DCMI, 2011). Moreover, current research has
attempted to integrate diverse metadata schemas by
mappings across existing schemas (Bountouri and
Gergatsoulis, 2009), or mappings of existing meta-
data to ontologies, either based on ad-hoc manually
developed ontologies (Liao et al, 2010), or on ex-
isting standard ontologies for cultural heritage pur-
poses (Lourdi et al, 2009), such as the CIDOC Con-
44
ceptual Reference Model (CIDOC, 2006). Other
approaches attempt to address the issue of meta-
data heterogeneity from a pure information retrieval
perspective and discard the diverse metadata struc-
tures in favour of the respective text content descrip-
tions for full text indexing (Koolen et al, 2007).
Zhang and Kamps (2009) attempt to exploit the ex-
isting metadata XML structure for XML-based re-
trieval, thus targeting individual document compo-
nents. Similarly to our approach, they investigate
metadata describing archive collections.
The work presented in this paper focuses on meta-
data for textual objects, such as archive documents,
and on the issue of explicit, semantic, content de-
scriptors in this metadata, rather than heterogene-
ity. In particular, we are concerned with the lack
of explicit content descriptors which would support
exploratory information search. For this purpose,
we attempt to automatically enrich manually cre-
ated metadata with content information. We view
the problem from an unsupervised, text mining per-
spective, whereby multi-word terms recognised in
free text are assumed to indicate content. In turn,
the respective inter-relationships among the recog-
nised terms in the hierarchy are assumed to reveal
the knowledge structure of the document collection.
In this paper, we start with a description of our
EAD dataset and the challenges which our dataset
poses in text processing. Subsequently, we discuss
our approach to the enrichment and structuring of
these archival descriptions and present our experi-
ments. We conclude with a discussion on our results
and our considerations for future work.
2 EAD and Challenges in Text Processing
The Encoded Archival Description (EAD) was con-
ceived as ?a nonproprietary encoding standard for
machine-readable finding aids such as inventories,
registers, indexes, and other documents created by
archives, libraries, museums, and manuscript repos-
itories to support the use of their holdings? (Li-
brary of Congress, 2002). It is intended to be a data
communication format based on SGML/XML syn-
tax, aiming at supporting the accessibility to archival
resources across different institutions and focusing
on the structural content of the archival descrip-
tion, rather than its presentation. For this reason,
the EAD schema is characterised by a hierarchi-
cal informational structure, where the deepest lev-
els in the schema may inherit descriptive informa-
tion defined in the upper levels. The schema de-
fines a total of 146 elements. The three highest level
elements are <eadheader>, <frontmatter>,
and <archdesc>. <eadheader> is an ele-
ment containing bibliographic and descriptive in-
formation about the metadata document, while
<frontmatter> is an optional element describ-
ing the creation, publication, or use of the metadata
document (Library of Congress, 2002). Both these
two upper level elements do not contain information
about the archival material itself. The designated el-
ement for this purpose is <archdesc> which de-
scribes ?the content, context, and extent of a body
of archival materials, including administrative and
supplemental information that facilitates use of the
materials? (Library of Congress, 2002).
EAD metadata files can be lengthy and com-
plex in structure, with deep nesting of the XML
hierarchy elements. As Zhang and Kamps (2009)
also observe, the EAD elements may be of three
types:
i. atomic units (or text content elements) which
contain only text and no XML elements;
ii. composite units (or nested elements) which
contain as nested other XML elements;
iii. mixed elements which contain both atomic and
composite units.
The EAD documents used in this study describe
archival collections of the International Institute of
Social History (IISH). They are of varying length
and are often characterised by long spans of non-
annotated, free text. The degree of annotation, es-
pecially within mixed element types is inconsistent.
For example, some names may be annotated in one
element and others not, while quite often repeated
mentions of the same name may not be annotated.
Moreover, the text within an annotated element may
include annotator comments (e.g., translations, alter-
nate names, questions, notes, etc.), either in square
brackets or parentheses, again in an inconsistent
manner. The multilingual text content poses another
challenge. In particular, the languages used in the
description text vary, not only within a single EAD
document, but often also within an element (mixed
or atomic). In our approach, the former is addressed
45
by identifying the language at element level (cf. Sec-
tion 3.2). However, the issue of mixed languages
within an element is not addressed. This introduces
errors, especially for multilingual elements of short
text length.
3 Enrichment and Structuring Method
The overall rationale behind our method for the en-
richment of EAD metadata with semantic content in-
formation is based on two hypotheses:
i. multi-word terms recognised in free text are
valid indicators of content, and
ii. the respective term inter-relationships reflect
the knowledge structure of the collection.
Thus, automatic term recognition and subsequent
term clustering constitute the two core components
of our EAD processing. In particular, as illustrated
in Figure 1, we start with a pre-processing phase,
where the EAD input SGML/XML files are first
parsed, in order to retrieve the respective text con-
tent snippets, and then classified, based on language.
Subsequently, terms are recognised automatically.
The resulting terms are clustered as a hierarchy and,
finally, the documents are classified according to the
term hierarchy, based on the terms that they contain.
To evaluate our term recognition process, we exploit
knowledge from two sources: existing annotations
in the EAD files, such as entity annotation residing
in mixed elements (cf. Section 2) and entity and sub-
ject term information originating from the respective
cultural heritage institution Authority files, namely
the library files providing standard references for en-
tities and terms that curators should use in their ob-
ject descriptions. In this section, we discuss in more
detail the methodology for each of the components
of our approach.
3.1 EAD Text Element Extraction
In our processing of the EAD metadata XML, we
focused on the free text content structured below
the <archdesc> root element. As discussed in
Section 2, it is the only top element which con-
tains information about the archival material itself.
In the text element extraction process, we parse
the EAD XML and, from the hierarchically struc-
tured elements below <archdesc>, we select the
text contained in <abstract>, <bioghist>,
<scopecontent>, <odd>, <note> , <dsc>
and <descgrp> and their nested elements.
Among these elements, the <dsc> (Description
of Subordinate Components) provides information
about the hierarchical groupings of the materials be-
ing described, whereas <descgrp> (DSC Group)
defines nested encoded finding aids. They were se-
lected because they may contain nested information
of interest. The rest of the elements were selected
because they contain important free text information
related to the archive content:
- <bioghist>: describing the archive creator
e.g. the life of the individual or family, or
the administrative history of the organisation
which created the archive;
- <scopecontent>: referring to the range
and topical coverage of the described materials,
often naming significant organisations, individ-
uals, events, places, and subjects represented;
- <odd>: other descriptive data;
- <note>: referring to archivist comments and
explanations;
- <abstract>: brief summaries of all the
above information.
All other elements not referring to the archive se-
mantic content, such as administrative information,
storage arrangement, physical location, etc. were ig-
nored. Moreover, atomic or composite elements
without free text descriptions were not selected, be-
cause the descriptive information therein is assumed
to be already fully structured.
3.2 Language Identification
As mentioned in Section 2, the languages used in
the description text of the EAD documents vary, not
only within a single EAD document, but often also
within an EAD element. In our approach, the objec-
tive of the language identification process is to de-
tect the language of the text content snippets, i.e. the
output of the text element extraction process, and
classify these snippets accordingly (cf. Figure 1).
Language identification is a text categorisation
task, whereby identifiers attempt to learn the mor-
phology of a language based on training text and,
subsequently, use this information to classify un-
known text accordingly. For this reason, training a
language identification component requires a train-
ing corpus for each language of interest.
46
Figure 1: Block diagram of EAD metadata enrichment and structuring process
Computational approaches to language identifi-
cation can be coarsely classified into information-
theoretic, word-based, and N-gram-based.
Information-theoretic approaches compare the
compressibility of the input text to the compress-
ibility of text in the known languages. Measuring
compressibility employs mutual information mea-
sures (Poutsma, 2002). Word-based approaches
consider the amount of common words or special
characters between the input text and a known
language. Finally, N-gram-based approaches con-
struct language models beyond word boundaries,
based on the occurrence statistics of N-grams up
to some predefined length N (Dunning, 1994).
The subsequent language identification in unknown
text is based on the similarity of the unknown text
N-gram model to each training language model.
As evidenced by these approaches, language iden-
tification relies on some form of comparison of the
unknown text to known languages. For this reason,
the respective text categorisation into a given lan-
guage suffers when the input text is not long enough:
the shorter the input text is, the fewer the available
features for comparison against known language
models. Moreover, errors in the categorisation pro-
cess are also introduced, when the language models
under comparison share the same word forms.
In our approach, we have opted for the most pop-
ular language identification method, the one based
on N-grams. Nevertheless, any other language iden-
tification method could have been applied.
3.3 Term Recognition
The objective of term recognition is the identifica-
tion of linguistic expressions denoting specialised
concepts, namely domain or scientific terms. For in-
formation management and retrieval purposes, the
automatic identification of terms is of particular im-
portance because these specialised concept expres-
sions reflect the respective document content.
Term recognition approaches largely rely on the
identification of term formation patterns. Linguistic
approaches use either syntactic (Justeson and Katz,
1995; Hearst, 1998), or morphological (Heid, 1998)
rule patterns, often in combination with termino-
logical or other lexical resources (Gaizauskas et al,
2000) and are typically language and domain spe-
cific.
Statistical approaches typically combine linguis-
tic information with statistical measures. These
measures can be coarsely classified into two
categories: unithood-based and termhood-based.
Unithood-based approaches measure the attachment
strength among the constituents of a candidate
term. For example, some unithood-based mea-
sures are frequency of co-occurrence, hypothesis
testing statistics, log-likelihood ratios test (Dunning,
1993) and pointwise mutual information (Church
and Hanks, 1990). Termhood-based approaches at-
tempt to measure the degree up to which a candidate
expression is a valid term, i.e. refers to a specialised
concept. They attempt to measure this degree by
considering nestedness information, namely the fre-
47
quencies of candidate terms and their subsequences.
Examples of such approaches are C-Value and NC-
Value (Frantzi et al, 2000) and the statistical barrier
method (Nakagawa, 2000).
It has been experimentally shown that termhood-
based approaches to automatic term extraction out-
perform unithood-based ones and that C-Value
(Frantzi et al, 2000) is among the best perform-
ing termhood-based approaches (Korkontzelos et
al., 2008). For this reason, we choose to employ
the C-Value measure in our pipeline. C-Value ex-
ploits nestedness and comes together with a com-
putationally efficient algorithm, which scores can-
didate multi-word terms according to the measure,
considering:
- the total frequency of occurrence of the candi-
date term;
- the frequency of the candidate term as part of
longer candidate terms;
- the number of these distinct longer candidates;
- the length of the candidate term (in tokens).
These arguments are expressed in the following
nestedness formula:
N(?) =
?
?
?
f(?), if ? is not nested
f(?)?
1
|T?|
?
b?T?
f(b), otherwise (1)
where ? is the candidate term, f(?) is its frequency,
T? is the set of candidate terms that contain ? and
|T?| is the cardinality of T?. In simple terms, the
more frequently a candidate term appears as a sub-
string of other candidates, the less likely it is to be a
valid term. However, the greater the number of dis-
tinct term candidates in which the target term can-
didate occurs as nested, the more likely it is to be
a valid term. The final C-Value score considers the
length (|?|) of each candidate term (?) as well:
C-value(?) = log2 |?| ?N(?) (2)
The C-Value method requires linguistic pre-
processing in order to detect syntactic term for-
mation patterns. In our approach, we used Lex-
Tagger (Vasilakopoulos, 2003), which combines
transformation-based learning with decision trees
and we adapted its respective lexicon to our domain.
We also included WordNet lemma information in
our processing, for text normalisation purposes. Lin-
guistic pre-processing is followed by the computa-
tion of C-Value on the candidate terms, in length or-
der, longest first. Candidates that satisfy a C-Value
threshold are sorted in decreasing C-Value order.
3.4 Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
In our approach, term recognition provides content
indicators. In order to make explicit the knowl-
edge structure of the EAD, our method requires
some form of concept classification and structuring.
The process of hierarchical agglomerative cluster-
ing serves this objective.
Agglomerative algorithms are very popular in
the field of unsupervised concept hierarchy induc-
tion and are typically employed to produce unla-
belled taxonomies (King, 1967; Sneath and Sokal,
1973). Hierarchical clustering algorithms are based
on measuring the distance (dissimilarity) between
pairs of objects. Given an object distance metric D,
the similarity of two clusters, A and B, can be de-
fined as a function of the distance D between the
objects that the clusters contain. According to this
similarity, also called linkage criterion, the choice
of which clusters to merge or split is made. In our
approach, we have experimented with the three most
popular criteria, namely:
Complete linkage (CL): The similarity of two clus-
ters is the maximum distance between their elements
simCL(A,B) = max
x?A,y?B
D(x, y) (3)
Single linkage (SL): The similarity of two clusters
is the minimum distance between their elements
simSL(A,B) = min
x?A,y?B
D(x, y) (4)
Average linkage (AL): The similarity of two clusters
is the average distance between their elements
simAL(A,B) =
1
|A| ? |B|
?
x?A
?
y?B
D(x, y) (5)
To estimate the distance metric D we use either
the document co-occurrence or the lexical similar-
ity metric. The chosen distance metric D and link-
age criterion are employed to derive a hierarchy of
terms by agglomerative clustering.
Our document co-occurrence (DC) metric is de-
fined as the number of documents (d) in the collec-
tion (R) in which both terms (t1 and t2) co-occur:
DC =
1
|R|
|{d : (d ? R) ? (t1 ? d) ? (t2 ? d)}| (6)
48
The above metric accepts that the distance between
two terms is inversely proportional to the number of
documents in which they co-occur.
Lexical Similarity (LS), as defined in Nenadic?
and Ananiadou (2006), is based on shared term con-
stituents:
LS =
|P (h1) ? P (h2)|
|P (h1)|+ |P (h2)|
+
|P (t1) ? P (t2)|
|P (t1)|+ |P (t2)|
(7)
where t1 and t2 are two terms, h1 and h2 their heads,
P (h1) and P (h2) their set of head words, and P (t1)
and P (t2) their set of constituent words, respec-
tively.
3.5 Document Classification
The term hierarchy is used in our approach for se-
mantic classification of documents. In this process,
we start by assigning to each leaf node of the term
hierarchy the set of EAD documents in which the
corresponding term occurs. Higher level nodes are
assigned the union of the document sets of their
daughters. The process is bottom-up and applied it-
eratively, until all hierarchy nodes are assigned a set
of documents.
Document classification, i.e. the assignment of
document sets to term hierarchy nodes, is use-
ful, among others, for structured search and index-
ing purposes. Moreover, it provides a direct soft-
clustering of documents based on semantics, given
the number of desired clusters, C. C corresponds
to a certain horizontal cut of the term hierarchy, so
that C top nodes appear, instead of one. The doc-
ument sets assigned to these C top nodes represent
the C desired clusters. This document clustering ap-
proach is soft, since each document can occur in one
or more clusters.
3.6 Evaluation Process
The automatic evaluation process, illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, serves the purpose of evaluating the term
recognition accuracy. Since the objective of term
recognition tools is the detection of linguistic ex-
pressions denoting specialised concepts, i.e. terms,
the results evaluation would ideally require input
from the respective domain experts. This is a la-
borious and time consuming process which also en-
tails finding the experts willing to dedicate effort
and time for this task. In response to this issue,
we decided to exploit the available domain-specific
knowledge resources and automate part of the eval-
uation process by comparing our results to this ex-
isting information. Thus, the automatic evaluation
process is intended to give us an initial estimate
of our performance and reduce the amount of re-
sults requiring manual evaluation. The available re-
sources used are of two types:
i. entity annotations in the EAD documents (i.e.
names of persons, organisations and geograph-
ical locations);
ii. entity and subject terms originating from the
cultural heritage institution Authority files.
The entity annotations in the EAD documents
were not considered during our term recognition.
The entity and subject terms of the respective Au-
thority file records are encoded in MARC21/XML
format (Library of Congress, 2010). MARC
(MAchine-Readable Cataloging) is a standard initi-
ated by the US Library of Congress and concerns
the representation of bibliographic information and
related data elements used in library catalogues. The
MARC21 Authority files resource used in our eval-
uation provides, among other information, the stan-
dard references for entities and the respective pos-
sible entity reference variations, such as alternate
names or acronyms, etc., that curators should use
in their object descriptions. The subject term Au-
thority records provide mappings between a legacy
subject term thesaurus which is no longer used for
classification, and current library records.
In the evaluation process the EAD SGML/XML
and the MARC21/XML Authority files are first
parsed by the respective parsers in order to extract
the XML elements of interest. Subsequently, the
text-content of the elements is processed for nor-
malisation and variant generation purposes. In this
process, normalisation involves cleaning up the text
from intercepted comments and various types of
inconsistent notes, such as dates, aliases and al-
ternate names, translations, clarifications, assump-
tions, questions, lists, etc. Variant generation in-
volves detecting the acronyms, abbreviated names
and aliases mentioned in the element text and cre-
ating the reversed variants for, e.g., [Last Name,
First Name] sequences. The results of this pro-
cess, from both EAD and Authority files, are merged
into a single list for every respective category (or-

ganisations, persons, geographic locations and sub-
ject terms) and are compared to our term results list.
4 Experimental Setting
For training the language identification component,
we used the European Parliament Proceedings Par-
allel Corpus (Europarl) which covers the proceed-
ings of the European Parliament from 1996 to 2006
(Koehn, 2005). The corpus size is 40 million words
per language and is translated in Danish, German,
Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian,
Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish. In our experiments,
we take as input for subsequent term recognition
only the snippets identified as English text.
In the experiments reported in this work, we ac-
cept as term candidates morpho-syntactic pattern se-
quences which consist of adjectives and nouns, and
end with a noun. The C-Value algorithm (cf. Sec-
tion 3.3) was implemented under two different set-
tings:
i. one only considering as term candidates adjec-
tive and noun sequences that appear at least
once as non-nested in other candidate terms;
and
ii. one that considers all adjective and noun se-
quences, even if they never occur as non-
nested.
Considering that part-of-speech taggers usually suf-
fer high error rates when applied on specialty do-
mains, the former setting is expected to increase pre-
cision, whereas the latter to increase recall (cf. Sec-
tion 5).
We accepted as valid terms all term candidates
whose C-Value score exceeds a threshold, which
was set to 3.0 after experimentation. In the subse-
quent hierarchical agglomerative clustering process,
we experimented with all six combinations of the
three linkage criteria (i.e. complete, single and aver-
age) with the two distance metrics (i.e. document
co-occurrence and lexical similarity) described in
Figure 2: Length of snippets per identified language.
Section 3.4.
5 Results
The EAD document collection used for this study
consisted of 3, 093 SGML/XML files. As shown on
Table 1, according to our language identifier, the ma-
jority of the text snippets of the selected EAD XML
elements were in Dutch, followed by German and
English. We selected for later processing 19, 767
snippets classified as English text, corresponding to
419, 857 tokens. A quantitative evaluation of the
language identifier results has not been performed.
However, our observation of the term recognition re-
sults showed that there were some phrases, mostly
Dutch and German entity names (organisations and
persons mostly) classified as English. This might be
due to these entities appearing in their original lan-
guage within English text, as it is often the case in
our EAD files. Moreover, manual inspection of our
results showed that other languages classified as En-
glish, e.g. Turkish and Czech, were not covered by
Europarl.
As mentioned in Section 3.2, short text snip-
pets may affect language identification performance.
Figure 2 illustrates the snippet length per identified
language. We observe that the majority of text snip-
pets is below 10 tokens, few fall within an average
length of 20 to 50 tokens approximately, and very
few are above 100 tokens.
Figure 3 shows the results of our automatic evalu-
ation for the term recognition process. In this graph,
the upper, red curve shows the percentage of cor-
rect terms for the C-Value setting considering as
term candidates adjective and noun sequences that
appear at least once as non-nested in other candi-
date terms. The lower, blue curve shows the per-

centage of correct terms for the C-Value setting con-
sidering all adjective and noun sequences, even if
they never occur as non-nested. In this automatic
evaluation, correct terms are, as presented in Sec-
tion 3.6, those candidate terms matching the com-
bined lists of entity and subject terms acquired by
the respective EAD and MARC21 Authority files.
We observe that the C-Value setting which considers
only noun phrase patterns occurring at least once as
non-nested, displays precision up to approximately
70% for the top terms in the ranked list, whereas the
other setting considering all noun phrase sequences,
reaches a maximum of 49%. The entire result set
above the 3.0 C-Value threshold amounts to 1, 345
and 2, 297 terms for each setting, and reaches pre-
cision of 42.01% and 28.91% respectively. Thus,
regarding precision, the selective setting clearly out-
performs the one considering all noun phrases, but it
also reaches a lower recall, as indicated by the ac-
tual terms within the threshold. We also observe
that precision drops gradually below the threshold,
an indication that the ranking of the C-Value mea-
sure is effective in promoting valid terms towards
the top. This automatic evaluation considers as erro-
neous unknown terms which may be valid. Further
manual evaluation by domain experts is required for
a more complete picture of the results.
Figure 4 shows six dendrograms, each represent-
ing the term hierarchy produced by the respective
combination of linkage criterion to distance metric.
The input for these experiments consists of all terms
exceeding the C-Value threshold, and by considering
only noun phrase sequences appearing at least once
as non-nested. Since the hierarchies contain 1, 345
terms, the dendrograms are very dense and difficult
to inspect thoroughly. However, we include them
based on the fact that the overall shape of the den-
drogram can indicate how much narrow or broad the
corresponding hierarchy is and indirectly its quality.
Narrow here characterises hierarchies whose most
non-terminal nodes are parents of one terminal and
one non-terminal node. Narrow hierarchies are deep
while broader hierarchies are shallower.
Broad and shallow hierarchies are, in our case, of
higher quality, since terms are expected to be related
to each other and form distinct groups. In this view,
average linkage leads to richer hierarchies (Figures
4(c), 4(f)), followed by single linkage (Figures 4(b),
4(e)) and, finally, complete linkage (Figures 4(a),
4(d)). The hierarchy of higher quality seems to
be the result of average linkage and document co-
occurrence combination (Figure 4(c)), followed by
the combination of average linkage and lexical sim-
ilarity (Figure 4(f)). Clearly, these two hierarchies
need to be investigated manually and closely to ex-
tract further conclusions. Moreover, an application-
based evaluation could investigate whether different
clustering settings suit different tasks.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have presented a methodology for
semantically enriching archival description meta-
data and structuring the metadata collection. We
consider that terms are indicators of content seman-
tics. In our approach, we perform term recogni-
tion and then hierarchically structure the recognised
terms. Finally, we use the term hierarchy to classify
the metadata documents. We also propose an auto-
matic evaluation of the recognised terms, by com-
paring them to domain knowledge resources.
For term recognition, we used the C-Value al-
gorithm and found that considering noun phrases
which appear at least once independently, outper-
forms considering all noun phrases. Regarding hier-
archical clustering, we observe that the average link-
age criterion combined with a distance metric based
on document co-occurrence produces a rich broad
hierarchy. A more thorough evaluation of these re-
sults is required. This should include a manual eval-
uation of recognised terms by domain experts and
an application-based evaluation of the resulting doc-
ument classification.
