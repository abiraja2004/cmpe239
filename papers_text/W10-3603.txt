Abstract 
This paper reports about the develop-
ment of clause identification and classi-
fication techniques for Bengali language. 
A syntactic rule based model has been 
used to identify the clause boundary. For 
clause type identification a Conditional 
random Field (CRF) based statistical 
model has been used. The clause identi-
fication system and clause classification 
system demonstrated 73% and 78% pre-
cision values respectively.  
1 Introduction 
The clause identification is one of the shallow 
semantic parsing tasks, which is important in 
various NLP applications such as Machine 
Translation, parallel corpora alignment, Informa-
tion Extraction and speech applications. Gram-
matically a clause is a group of words having a 
subject and a predicate of its own, but forming 
part of a sentence. Clause boundary identifica-
tion of natural language sentences poses consi-
derable difficulties due to the ambiguous nature 
of natural languages. Clause classification is a 
convoluted task as natural language is generally 
syntactically rich in formation of sentences or 
clauses. 
By the classical theory of Panini (Paul and 
Staal, 1969) a clause is the surface level basic 
syntactic element which holds the basic depen-
dent semantics (i.e. lexical semantic have no 
dependency) to represent the overall meaning of 
any sentence. This syntactic to semantic deriva-
tion proceeds through two intermediate stages: 
the level of karaka relations, which are compa-
rable to the thematic role types and the level of 
inflectional or derivational morphosyntax. 
Fillmore?s Case Grammar (Fillmore et. al, 
2003), and much subsequent work, revived the 
Panini?s proposals in a modern setting. A main 
objective of Case Grammar was to identify syn-
tactic positions of semantic arguments that may 
have different realizations in syntax.  
In the year of 1996 Bharati et al (1996) de-
fines the idea of Chunk or local word group for 
Indian languages. After the successful imple-
mentation of Shakti1 , the first publicly available 
English-Hindi machine translation system the 
idea of chunk became the most acceptable syn-
tactic/semantic representation format for Indian 
languages, known as Shakti Standard Format 
(SSF).   
In 2009 Bali et al (2009) redefines the idea of 
chunk and establishes that the idea of chunking 
varies with prosodic structure of a language. 
Boundary of chunk level is very ambiguous it-
self and can differ by writer or speaker accord-
ing to their thrust on semantic. 
Therefore it is evident that automatic clause 
identification for Indian languages needs more 
research efforts. In the present task, clause 
boundary identification is attempted using the 
classical theory of Panini and the Case Grammar 
approach of Fillmore on the shallow parsed out-
put in SSF structure. It may be worth mentioning 
that several basic linguistic tools in Indian lan-
guages such as part of speech tagger, chunker, 
and shallow parser follow SSF2  as a standard.  
Previous research on clause identification was 
done mostly on the English language (Sang and 
Dejean, 2001). There have been limited efforts 
on clause identification for Indian languages. 
One such effort is proposed in Ram and Devi,

(2008) with statistical method. The idea of ge-
nerative grammar based on rule-based descrip-
tions of syntactic structures introduced by 
Chomsky (Chomsky, 1956) points out that every 
language has its own peculiarities that cannot be 
described by standard grammar. Therefore a new 
concept of generative grammar has been pro-
posed by Chomsky. Generative grammar can be 
identified by statistical methods. In the present 
task, conditional random field (CRF) 3  -based 
machine learning method has been used in 
clause type classification. According to the best 
of our knowledge this is the first effort to identi-
fy and classify clauses in Bengali. 
The present system is divided into two parts. 
First, the clause identification task aims to iden-
tify the start and the end boundaries of the claus-
es in a sentence. Second, Clause classification 
system identifies the clause types. 
Analysis of corpus and standard grammar of 
Bengali revealed that clause boundary identifica-
tion depends mostly on syntactic dependency. 
For this reason, the present clause boundary 
identification system is rule based in nature. 
Classification of clause is a semantic task and 
depends on semantic properties of Bengali lan-
guage. Hence we follow the theory of 
Chomsky?s generative grammar to disambiguate 
among possible clause types. The present classi-
fication system of clause is a statistics-based 
approach. A conditional random field (CRF) 
based machine learning method has been used in 
the clause classification task. The output of the 
rule based identification system is forwarded to 
the machine learning model as input. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In section 2 we elaborate the rule based clause 
boundary identification. The next section 3 de-
scribes the implementation detail with all identi-
fied features for the clause classification prob-
lem. Result section 4 reports about the accuracy 
of the hybrid system. In error analysis section 
we reported the limitations of the present sys-
tem. The conclusion is drawn in section 5 along 
with the future task direction. 
2 Resource Acquisition 
Bengali belongs to Indo-Aryan language family. 
A characteristic of Bengali is that it is under-

resourced. Language research for Bengali got 
attention recently. Resources like annotated cor-
pus and linguistics tools for Bengali are very 
rarely available in the public domain. 
2.1 Corpus 
We used the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 
20094 dependency relation marked training data-
set of 980 sentences for training of the present 
system. The data has been further annotated at 
the clause level. According to the standard 
grammar there are two basic clause types such as 
Principal clause and Subordinate clause. Subor-
dinate clauses have three variations as Noun 
clause, Adjective clause and Adverbial clause. 
The tagset defined for the present task consists 
of four tags as Principal clause (PC), Noun 
clause (NC), Adjective clause (AC) and Adver-
bial clause (RC). The annotation tool used for 
the present task is Sanchay5. The detailed statis-
tics of the corpus are reported in Table 1.

2.1.1 Annotation Agreement 
Two annotators (Mr. X and Mr. Y) participated 
in the present task. Annotators were asked to 
identify the clause boundaries as well as the type 
of the identified clause. The agreement of anno-
tations among two annotators has been eva-
luated. The agreements of tag values at clause 
boundary level and clause type levels are listed 
in Table 2.

Table 2: Agreement of annotators at clause 
boundary and type level 
It is observed from the Table 2 that clause 
boundary identification task has lower agree-
ment value. A further analysis reveals that there 
are almost 9% of cases where clause boundary 
has nested syntactic structure. These types of 
clause boundaries are difficult to identify. One 
of such cases is Inquisitive semantic (Groenen-
dijk, 2009) cases, ambiguous for human annota-

tors too. It is better to illustrate with some spe-
cific example. 
If John goes to the party, 
will Mary go as well? 
In an inquisitive semantics for a language of 
propositional logic the interpretation of disjunc-
tion is the source of inquisitiveness. Indicative 
conditionals and conditional questions are 
treated both syntactically and semantically. The 
semantics comes with a new logical-
pragmatically notion that judges and compares 
the compliance of responses to an initiative in 
inquisitive dialogue (Groenendijk, 2009). Hence 
it is evident that these types of special cases 
need special research attention. 
2.2 Shallow Parser 
Shallow parser6 for Indian languages, developed 
under a Government of India funded consortium 
project named Indian Language to Indian Lan-
guage Machine Translation System (IL-ILMT), 
are now publicly available. It is a well developed 
linguistic tool and produce good credible analy-
sis. For the present task the linguistic analysis is 
done by the tool and it gives output as pruned 
morphological analysis at each word level, part 
of speech at each word level, chunk boundary 
with type-casted chunk label, vibhakti computa-
tion and chunk head identification. 
2.3 Dependency parser 
A dependency parser for Bengali has been used 
as described in Ghosh et al (2009). The depen-
dency parser follows the tagset7  identified for 
Indian languages as a part of NLP TOOLS 
CONTEST 2009 as a part of ICON 2009. 
3 Rule-based Clause Boundary Identi-
fication 
Analysis of a Bengali corpus and standard 
grammar reveals that clause boundaries are di-
rectly related to syntactic relations at sentence 
level. The present system first identifies the 
number of verbs present in a sentence and sub-
sequently finds out dependant chunks to each 
verb. The set of identified chunks that have rela-
tion with a particular verb is considered as a 
clause. But some clauses have nested syntactic

formation, known as inquisitive semantic. These 
clauses are difficult to identify by using only 
syntactic relations. The present system has limi-
tations on those inquisitive types of clauses. 
Bengali is a verb final language. Most of the 
Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb 
(SOV) pattern. In Bengali, subject can be miss-
ing in a clause formation. Missing subjects and 
missing keywords lead to ambiguities in clause 
boundary identification. In sentences which do 
not follow the SOV pattern, chunks that appear 
after the finite verb are not considered with that 
clause. For example:  
 
wAra AyZawana o parimANa 
xeKe buJawe asubiXA hayZa ei  
paWa hAwi geCe. 
 
After seeing the size and 
effect, it is hard to under-
stand that an elephant went 
through this way. 
 
In the above example, there is hardly any clue 
to find beginning of subordinate clause. To solve 
this type of problem, capturing only the tree 
structure of a particular sentence has been 
treated as the key factor to the goal of disambig-
uation. One way to capture the regularity of 
chunks over different sentences is to learn a ge-
nerative grammar that explains the structure of 
the chunks one finds. These types of language 
properties make the clause identification prob-
lem difficult.  
3.1 Karaka relation 
Dependency parsing generates the inter chunk 
relation and generates the tree structure. The de-
pendency parser as described in Section 2.3 used 
as a supportive tool for the present problem.   
In the output of the dependency parsing sys-
tems, most of the chunks have a dependency 
relation with the verb chunk. These relations are 
called as karaka relation. Using dependency re-
lations, the chunks having dependency relation 
i.e. karaka relation with same verb chunk are 
grouped. The set of chunks are the members of a 
clause. Using this technique, identification of 
chunk members of a certain clause becomes in-
dependent of SOV patterns of sentences. An ex-
ample is shown in Figure 1. 
19
 Figure 1: Karaka Relations 
3.2 Compound verbs  
In Bengali language a noun chunk with an infi-
nite verb chunk or a finite verb chunk can form a 
compound verb. An example is shown in Figure 
2. 
 
Figure 2: Compound Verb 
In the above example, the noun chunk and the 
VGF chunk form a compound verb. These two 
consecutive noun and verb chunks appearing in 
a sentence are merged to form a compound verb. 
These chunks are connected with a part-of rela-
tion in Dependency Parsing. The set of related 
chunks with these noun and verb chunks are 
merged.  
3.3 Shasthi Relation (r6) 
In dependency parsing the genitive relation are 
marked with shasthi (r6) relation. The chunk 
with shasthi (r6) (see the tagset of NLP Tool 
Contest: ICON 2009) relation always has a rela-
tion with the succeeding chunk. An example is 
shown in Figure 3. 
In the example as mentioned in Figure 3, the 
word ?wadera?(their) has a genitive relation 
with the word in the next chunk ?manera?(of 
mind). These chunks are placed in a set. It forms 
a set of two chunks members. The system gene-
rates two different types of set. In one forms a 
set of members having relation with verb 
chunks. Another set contains two noun chunks 
with genitive relation. Now the sets containing 
only noun chunks with genitive relation does not 
form a clause. Those sets are merged with the set 
containing verb chunk and having dependency 
relation with the noun chunks. An example is 
shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3: Shasthi Relation 
 
Consider ? is set of all sets containing two 
chunk members connected with genitive marker. 
Consider ? is a set of all sets consisting of re-
lated chunks with a verb chunk. ? is a element of 
?. ? is a element of ?. Now, If a set ? which can 
have common chunks from a ? set then ? set is 
associated with the proper ? set. So, ? ? ? ? 
Null then ? = ? ? ?. If a set ? which can have 
common chunks from two ? sets which leads to 
ambiguity of associability of the ? set with the 
proper ? set. If ? ? ? = verb chunk, then ? set 
will be associated with ? set containing the verb 
chunk. From the related set of chunk of verb 
chunks, system has identified the clauses in the 
sentence. Afterwards, the clauses are marked 
with the B-I-E (Beginning-Intermediate-End) 
notation.

rian Panini sometime during 600 or 300 B.C. 
(Robins, 1979), includes a sophisticated theory 
of thematic structure that remains influential till 
today. Panini?s Sanskrit grammar is a system of 
rules for converting semantic representations of 
sentences into phonetic representations (Ki-
parsky, 1969). This derivation proceeds through 
two intermediate stages: the level of karaka rela-
tions, which are comparable to the thematic role 
types described above; and the level of morpho-
syntax. 
Fillmore?s Case Grammar (Fillmore, 1968), 
and much subsequent work, revived the Panini?s 
proposals in a modern setting. A main objective 
of Case Grammar was to identify semantic ar-
gument positions that may have different realiza-
tions in syntax. Fillmore hypothesized ?a set of 
universal, presumably innate, concepts which 
identify certain types of judgments human be-
ings are capable of making about the events that 
are going on around them?. He posited the fol-
lowing preliminary list of cases, noting however 
that ?additional cases will surely be needed?.  
? Agent: The typically animate perceived 
instigator of the action. 
? Instrument: Inanimate force or object 
causally involved in the action or state. 
? Dative: The animate being affected by 
the state or action. 
? Factitive: The object or being resulting 
from the action or state. 
? Locative: The location or time-spatial 
orientation of the state or action. 
? Objective: The semantically most neu-
tral case, the concept should be limited to 
things which are affected by the action or 
state. 
The SSF specification handles this syntactic 
dependency by a coarse-grain tagset of Nomini-
tive, Accusative, Genitive and Locative case 
markers. Bengali shallow parser identifies the 
chunk heads as part of the chunk level analysis. 
Dependency parsing followed by a rule based 
module has been developed to analyze the inter-
chunk relationships depending upon each verb 
present in a sentence. Described theoretical as-
pect can well define the problem definition of 
clause boundary identification but during prac-
tical implementation of the solution we found 
some difficulties. Bengali has explicit case 
markers and thus long distant chunk relations are 
possible as valid grammatical formation. As an 
example: 
bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa xeKA 
kare gela rAma. 
 
bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa rAma 
xeKA kare gela. 
 
rAma bAjAre yAoyZAra samayZa 
xeKA kare gela. 
 
Rama came to meet when he 
was going to market. 
 
In the above example rAma could be placed 
anywhere and still all the three syntactic forma-
tion are correct. For these feature of Bengali 
many dependency relation could be missed out 
located at far distance from the verb chunk in a 
sentence. Searching for uncountable numbers of 
chunks have dependency relation with a particu-
lar verb may have good idea theoretically but we 
prefer a checklist strategy to resolve the problem 
in practice. At this level we decided to check all 
semantic probable constituents by the definition 
of universal, presumably innate, concepts list. 
We found this is a nice fall back strategy to iden-
tify the clause boundary. Separately rules are 
written as described below. 
4.1 Agent 
Bengali is a verb final language. Most of the 
Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-Verb 
(SOV) pattern. In Bengali, subject can be miss-
ing in a clause formation. Missing subjects and 
missing keywords lead to ambiguities in clause 
boundary identification. 
 
  	? 
Close the door. 
 
In the previous case system marks 
?/door? as an ?Agent? whereas the 
?Agent? is ?you? (2nd person singular number), 
silent here.  
We developed rules using case marker, Gend-
er-Number-Person (GNP), morphological fea-
ture and modality features to disambiguate these 
21
types of phenomena. These rules help to stop 
false hits by identifying no 2nd person phrase 
was there in the example type sentences and em-
power to identify proper phrases by locating 
proper verb modality matching with the right 
chunk.  
4.2 Instrument 
Instrument identification is ambiguous for the 
same type of case marker (nominative) taken by 
agent and instrument. There is no ani-
mate/inanimate information is available at syn-
tactic level.

Bengali sentences follow a Subject-Object-

helpful to disambiguate between agent and in-
strument roles.

Table 3: Categories of Time Expressions 
 
Time expression identification has a different 
aspect in NLP applications. People generally 
studied time expression to track event or any 
other kind of IR task. Time expressions could be 
categorized in two types as General and Rela-
tive.  
In order to apply rule-based process we de-
veloped a manually augmented list with pre de-
fined categories as described in Table 3. Still 
there are many difficulties to identify special 
cases of relative time expressions. As an exam-
ple: 
+ (?	 & , -	? 
When moon rise we will start 
our journey. 
In the previous example the relative time ex-
pression is ?(?	/when rise? is tagged as infinite 
verb (for Bengali tag level is VGNF). Statistics 
reveals that these special types of cases approx-
imately are only 1.8-2% in overall corpus. 
These types of special cases are not handled 
by the present system. 
4.4 Factitive 
The particular role assignment is the most chal-
lenging task as it separately known as argument 
identification. To resolve this problem we need a 
relatively large corpus to learn fruitful feature 
similarities among argument structures. 
A manually generated list of causative post-
positional words and pair wise conjuncts as re-
ported in Table 4 has been prepared to identify 
argument phrases in sentences.

4.5 Locative 
Rules have been written using a manually edited 
list as described in Table 5. Morphological loca-
tive case marker feature have been successfully 
used in identification of locative marker. There 
is an ambiguity among Agent, Dative and Loca-
tive case marker as they orthographically gene-
rates same type of surface form (using common 
22
suffixes as: 	?, 	? etc). There is less differences 
we noticed among their syntactic dependency 
structure throughout the corpus. Positional in-
formation helps in many cases to disambiguate 
these cases.

A different type of problem we found where

Where people works there. 
Here ?	?	  	/Where people works? 
should be identified as locative marker. But this 
is a verb chunk and leads difficulty. Corpus sta-
tistics reveals that this type of syntactic forma-
tion is approximately 0.8-1.0% only and not 
been handled by the present system.

4.6 Objective 
The concept of objectivity is limited to things or 
human which are affected by the action or state. 
Statistical parser is a best way out for the present 
problem. The karma karaka (k2) identified by 
the dependency parser is simply the objective 
constituent of any clause. 
5 Identification the Type of Clauses  
After marking of the clause boundaries, clause 
types are identified. According to the clause 
structure and functions in a sentence, clauses are 
classified in to four types as principal clause, 
noun clause, adverbial clause and adjective 
clause. To identify the clause types, a CRF based 
statistical approach has been adopted.  
5.1 Generative Grammar 
In theoretical linguistics, generative grammar 
refers to a particular approach to the study of 
syntax. A generative grammar of a language at-
tempts to give a set of rules that will correctly 
predict which combinations of words will form 
grammatical sentences. Chomsky has argued 
that many of the properties of a generative 
grammar arise from an "innate" universal gram-
mar. Proponents of generative grammar have 
argued that most grammar is not the result of 
communicative function and is not simply 
learned from the environment. Strongly moti-
vated by Chomsky?s generative grammar we 
adopt the CRF based machine learning to learn 
the properties of a language and apply the know-
ledge to typecast clause classification as well.  
5.2 Conditional Random Fields (CRF)  
CRFs are undirected graphical models which 
define a conditional distribution over a label se-
quence given an observation sequence. CRF 
usually trained based on input features. Maxi-
mum likelihood is being calculated on chosen 
features for training.  
5.2.1 Features  
The vitality of using any machine learning ap-
proach is in identification of proper feature set. 
Conditional Random Field (CRF) works on a 
conditional distribution over a label sequence 
given an observation sequence. Hence CRF used 
here to statistically capture the prosodic structure 
of the language. The features experimentally 
found useful are chosen as listed below.  
5.2.2 Chunk Label 
An n-gram chunk label window has been fixed 
to capture internal arrangement of any particular 
clause type.  
5.2.3 Chunk Heads 
Chunk head pattern is the vital clue to identify 
the any clause pattern.  
5.2.4 Word 
In the clause type identification task words play 
a crucial part as word carries the information of 
the clause type.  
  From the input file in the SSF format, all the 
morphological information like root word, chunk 
heads are retrieved. The clause type identifica-
tion depends on the morphological information 
along with the position in the sentences and also 
the surrounding chunk labels. Therefore the CRF 
based statistical tool calculates the probability of 
23
the morphological information along with the 
dependency relations of the previous three and 
next three chunks. For the present task a quad-
gram technique is used as most of the sentences 
have around 10 chunks.  
The input file in the SSF format includes 
Chunk labels and word. The clause information 
in the input files are in B-I-E format so that the 
begin (B) / inside (I) / end (E) information for a 
clause are associated as a feature. The chunk 
heads, words are identified from the training file 
and noted as an input feature in the CRF based 
system. Each sentence is represented as a feature 
vector for the CRF machine learning task. The 
input features associated with each word in the 
training set are the word, clause boundary tags, 
chunk tag and clause type tags.  
6 Error Analysis  
During the development stage of the system we 
had studied the various clause boundary labeling 
errors committed by the system.  In the above 
examples, the system faces ambiguity to derive 
the rules for the identification of the clause 
members when a noun chunk acts as a noun 
modifier of a clause.  In complex sentences, the 
verb chunk of the subordinate clause may have 
noun modifier relation with the principal clause. 
As System forms the groups the chunks with 
dependency relation, system merges the subor-
dinate clause with principal clause. An example 
is shown in Figure 4.

8 Conclusion 
This paper reports about our works on clause 
identification and classification in Bengali lan-
guage. We have used the rule based system to 
identify clause boundary and a statistical CRF 
based model is used to decide the type of a 
clause.  
In future we would like to study different se-
mantic relations which can regulate clause type 
and boundary.
