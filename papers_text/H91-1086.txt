Our plan is to demonstrate a workstation accelerator 
(called PLUS) that not only executes the current speech 
recognition systems in real time, but that will also support 
the increasing computational demands of speech recog- 
nition systems for the next few years. The accelerator will 
also be useful for other compute bound applications. The 
accelerator will be replicated and made available to other 
sites. 
Our approach is to connect single-processor machines of 
roughly the performance of high-end workstations by 
means of a very fast and powerful communication 
mechanism. This makes the memory on each node visible 
to every other node as if the system were a single shared- 
memory multiprocessor. The prototype, for example, uses 
25MHz Motorola 88000 processors with up to 32 Mbytes 
of DRAM memory and 512 Kbytes of SRAM in each 
node; the interconnection is based on a MOSIS-built mesh 
router with 40Mbytes/sec bandwidth. 
PLUS's research contribution comprises new 
mechanisms to support shared-memory and synchroniza- 
tion between processors. The emphasis is on low latency 
and low overhead synchronization. 
The PLUS prototype is interfaced to host computer sys- 
tems by means of a SCSI interface, this interface can also 
perform speech input/output and limited signal processing. 
Interfacing PLUS to a host does not require any operating 
system change on the host. 
As of December 1990, 40 PLUS nodes have been fabri- 
cated and are awaiting testing. A three node PLUS system 
has been assembled and debugged and is currently running 
the Sphinx system in batch mode. The software nviron- 
ment now includes MACH C-threads which provides C 
language support for multiprocessor p ogramming. This is 
the same multiprocessor p ogramming environment that is 
used in the standard MACH operating system. Therefore 
developers can create applications on their MACH 
workstations that are easily portable to a PLUS system. 
Our future plans include the construction of 8 and 16 
node PLUS systems to support he development of very 
large vocabulary speech recognition. We are also develop- 
ing a parallel implementation f Viterbi beam search to 
take full advantage of the PLUS architecture.
