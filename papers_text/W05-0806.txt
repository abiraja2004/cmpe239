Abstract
In this work, we examine the quality of
several statistical machine translation sys-
tems constructed on a small amount of
parallel Serbian-English text. The main
bilingual parallel corpus consists of about
3k sentences and 20k running words from
an unrestricted domain. The translation
systems are built on the full corpus as well
as on a reduced corpus containing only
200 parallel sentences. A small set of
about 350 short phrases from the web is
used as additional bilingual knowledge. In
addition, we investigate the use of mono-
lingual morpho-syntactic knowledge i.e.
base forms and POS tags.
1 Introduction and Related Work
The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is
to translate a source language sequence f1, . . . , fJ
into a target language sequence e1, . . . , eI by max-
imising the conditional probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ). This
probability can be factorised into the translation
model probability P (fJ1 |eI1) which describes the
correspondence between the words in the source and
the target sequence, and the language model proba-
bility P (eJ1 ) which describes well-formedness of the
produced target sequence. These two probabilities
can be modelled independently of each other. For
detailed descriptions of SMT models see for exam-
ple (Brown et al, 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).
Translation probabilities are learnt from a bilin-
gual parallel text corpus and language model proba-
bilities are learnt from a monolingual text in the tar-
get language. Usually, the performance of a trans-
lation system strongly depends on the size of the
available training corpus. However, acquisition of
a large high-quality bilingual parallel text for the de-
sired domain and language pair requires lot of time
and effort, and, for many language pairs, is even not
possible. Besides, small corpora have certain advan-
tages - the acquisition does not require too much
effort and also manual creation and correction are
possible. Therefore there is an increasing number of
publications dealing with limited amounts of bilin-
gual data (Al-Onaizan et al, 2000; Nie?en and Ney,
2004).
For the Serbian language, as a rather minor and
not widely studied language, there are not many
language resources available, especially not parallel
texts. On the other side, investigations on this lan-
guage may be quite useful since the majority of prin-
ciples can be extended to the wider group of Slavic
languages (e.g. Czech, Polish, Russian, etc.).
In this work, we exploit small Serbian-English
parallel texts as a bilingual knowledge source for
statistical machine translation. In addition, we in-
vestigate the possibilities for improving the trans-
lation quality using morpho-syntactic information
in the source language. Some preliminary transla-
tion results on this language pair have been reported
in (Popovic? et al, 2004; Popovic? and Ney, 2004),
but no systematic investigation has been done so far.
This work presents several translation systems cre-
ated with different amounts and types of training
data and gives a detailed description of the language
resources used.

2 Language Resources
2.1 Language Characteristics
Serbian, as a Slavic language, has a very rich inflec-
tional morphology for all open word classes. There
are six distinct cases affecting not only common
nouns but also proper nouns as well as pronouns,
adjectives and some numbers. Some nouns and ad-
jectives have two distinct plural forms depending on
the number (if it is larger than four or not). There
are also three genders for the nouns, pronouns, ad-
jectives and some numbers leading to differences be-
tween the cases and also between the verb participles
for past tense and passive voice.
As for verbs, person and many tenses are ex-
pressed by the suffix, and the subject pronoun (e.g.
I, we, it) is often omitted (similarly as in Spanish and
Italian). In addition, negation of three quite impor-
tant verbs, ?biti? (to be, auxiliary verb for past tense,
conditional and passive voice), ?imati? (to have) and
?hteti? (to want, auxiliary verb for the future tense),
is done by adding the negative particle to the verb as
a prefix.
As for syntax, Serbian has a quite free word or-
der, and there are no articles, neither indefinite nor
definite.
All these characteristics indicate that morpho-
syntactic knowledge might be very useful for sta-
tistical machine translation involving Serbian lan-
guage, especially when only scarce amounts of par-
allel text are available.
2.2 Parallel Corpora
Finding high-quality bilingual or multilingual paral-
lel corpora involving Serbian language is a difficult
task. For example, there are several web-sites with
the news in both Serbian and English (some of them
in other languages as well), but these texts are only
comparable and not parallel at all. To our knowl-
edge, the only currently available Serbian-English
parallel text suitable for statistical machine trans-
lation is a manually created electronic version of
the Assimil language course which has been used
for some preliminary experiments in (Popovic? et al,
2004; Popovic? and Ney, 2004). We have used this
corpus for systematical investigations described in
this work.
2.2.1 Assimil Language Course
The electronic form of Assimil language course
contains about 3k sentences and 25k running words
of various types of conversations and descriptions as
well as a few short newspaper articles. Detailed cor-
pus statistics can be seen in Table 1. Since the do-
main of the corpus is basically not restricted, the vo-
cabulary size is relatively large. Due to the rich mor-
phology, the vocabulary for Serbian is almost two
times larger than for English. The average sentence
length for Serbian is about 8.5 words per sentence,
and for English about 9.5. This difference is mainly
caused by the lack of articles and omission of some
subject pronouns in Serbian .
The development and test set (500 sentences) are
randomly extracted from the original corpus and the
rest is used for training (referred to as 2.6k).
In order to investigate the scenario with extremely
scarce training material, a reduced training corpus
(referred to as 200) has been created by random ex-
traction of 200 sentences from the original training
corpus.
The morpho-syntactic annotation of the En-
glish part of the corpus has been done by the con-
straint grammar parser ENGCG for morphological
and syntactic analysis of English language. For each
word, this tool provides its base form and sequence
of morpho-syntactic tags.
For the Serbian corpus, to our knowlegde there
is no available tool for automatic annotation of this
language. Therefore, the base forms have been in-
troduced manually and the POS tags have been pro-
vided partly manually and partly automatically us-
ing a statistical maximum-entropy based POS tagger
similar to the one described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
First, the 200 sentences of the reduced training cor-
pus have been annotated completely manually. Then
the first 500 sentences of the rest of the training cor-
pus have been tagged automatically and the errors
have been manually corrected. Afterwards, the POS
tagger has been trained on the extended corpus (700
sentences), the next 500 sentences of the rest are an-
notated, and the procedure has been repeated until
the annotation has been finished for the complete
corpus.

2.2.2 Short Phrases
The short phrases used as an additional bilingual
knowledge source in our experiments have been col-
lected from the web and contain about 350 standard
words and short expressions with an average entry
length of 1.8 words for Serbian and 2 words for En-
glish. Table 2 shows that about 30% of words from
the phrase vocabulary are not present in the origi-
nal Serbian corpus and about 70% of those words
are not contained in the reduced corpus. For the
English language those numbers are smaller, about
20% for the original corpus and 60% for the reduced
one. These percentages are indicating that this par-
allel text, although very scarce, might be an useful
additional training material.
The phrases have also been morpho-syntactically
annotated in the same way as the main corpus.
2.2.3 External Test
In addition to the standard development and test
set described in Section 2.2.1, we also tested our
translation systems on a short external parallel text
collected from the BBC News web-site contain-
ing 22 sentences about relations between USA and
Ukraine after the revolution. As can be seen in Ta-
ble 1, this text contains very large portion of out-
of-vocabulary words (almost two thirds of Serbian
words and almost half of English words are not seen
in the training corpus), and has an average sentence
length about two times larger than the training cor-
pus.
3 Transformations in the Source Language
Standard SMT systems usually regard only full
forms of the words, so that translation of full forms
which have not been seen in the training corpus is
not possible even if the base form has been seen.
Since the inflectional morphology of the Serbian
language is very rich, as described in Section 2.1, we
investigate the use of the base forms instead of the
full forms to overcome this problem for the transla-
tion into English. We propose two types of trans-
formations of the Serbian corpus: conversion of the
full forms into the base forms and additional treat-
ment of the verbs.
For the other translation direction, we propose re-
moving the articles in the English part of the corpus
as the Serbian language does not have any.
3.1 Transformations of the Serbian Text
3.1.1 Base Forms
Serbian full forms of the words usually contain
information which is not relevant for translation into
English. Therefore, we propose conversion of all
Serbian words in their base forms. Although for
some other inflected languages like German and
Spanish this method did not yield any translation
improvement, we still considered it as promising be-
cause the number of Serbian inflections is consider-
ably higher than in the other two languages. Table 1
shows that this transformation significantly reduces
the Serbian vocabulary size so that it becomes com-
parable to the English one.
3.1.2 Treatment of Verbs
Inflections of Serbian verbs might contain rel-
evant information about the person, which is es-
pecially important when the pronoun is omitted.
Therefore, we apply an additional treatment of the
verbs. Whereas all other word classes are still re-
placed only by their base forms, for each verb a part
of the POS tag referring to the person is taken and
the verb is converted into a sequence of this tag and
its base form. For the three verbs described in Sec-
tion 2.1, the separation of the negative particle is also
applied: each negative full form is transformed into
the sequence of the POS tag, negative particle and
base form. The detailed statistics of this corpus is
not reported since there are no significant changes,
only the number of running words and average sen-
tence length increase thus becoming closer to the
values of the English corpus.
3.2 Transformations of the English Text
3.2.1 Removing Articles
Since the articles are one of the most frequent
word classes in English, but on the other side there
are no arcticles at all in Serbian, we propose remov-
ing the articles from the English corpus for trans-
lation into Serbian. Each English word which has
been detected as an article by means of its POS tag
has been removed from the corpus. In Table 1, it
can be seen that this method significantly reduces
the number of running words and the average sen-
tence length of the English corpus thus becoming
comparable to the values of the Serbian corpus.

4 Translation Experiments and Results
4.1 Experimental Settings
In order to systematically investigate the impact of
the bilingual training corpus size and the effects
of the morpho-syntactic information on the trans-
lation quality, the translation systems were trained
on the full training corpus (2.6k) and on the re-
duced training corpus (200), both with and with-
out short phrases. The translation is performed in
both directions, i.e. from Serbian to English and
other way round. For the Serbian to English trans-
lation systems, three versions of the Serbian corpus
have been used: original (baseline), base forms only
(sr base) and base forms with additional treatment
of the verbs (sr base+v-pos). For the translation into
Serbian, the systems were trained on two versions of
the English corpus: original (baseline) and without
articles (en no-article).
The baseline translation system is the Alignment
Templates system with scaling factors (Och and
Ney, 2002). Word alignments are produced using
GIZA++ toolkit without symmetrisation (Och and
Ney, 2003). Preprocessing of the source data has
been done before the training of the system, there-
fore modifications of the training and search pro-
cedure were not necessary for the translation of the
transformed source language corpora.
Although the development set has been used to
optimise the scaling factors, results obtained for this
set do not differ from those for the test set. There-
fore only the joint error rates (Development+Test)
are reported.
As for the external test set, results for this text are
reported only for the full corpus systems, since for
the reduced corpus the error rates are higher but the
effects of using phrases and morpho-syntactic infor-
mation are basically the same.
4.2 Translation Results
The evaluation metrics used in our experiments
are WER (Word Error Rate), PER (Position-
independent word Error Rate) and BLEU (BiLin-
gual Evaluation Understudy) (Papineni et al, 2002).
Since BLEU is an accuracy measure, we use 1-
BLEU as an error measure.
4.2.1 Translation from Serbian into English
Error rates for the translation from Serbian into
English are shown in Table 3 and some examples
are shown in Table 6. It can be seen that there is a
significant decrease in all error rates when the full
forms are replaced with their base forms. Since the
redundant information contained in the inflection is
removed, the system can better capture the relevant
information and is capable of producing correct or
approximatively correct translations even for unseen
full forms of the words (marked by ?UNKNOWN ?
in the baseline result example). The treatment of the
verbs yields some additional improvements.
From the first translation example in Table 6 it can
be seen how the problem of some out-of-vocabulary
words can be overcomed with the use of the base
forms. The second and third example are showing
the advantages of the verb treatment, the third one
illustrates the effect of separating the negative parti-
cle.
Reduction of the training corpus to only 200 sen-
tences (about 8% of the original corpus) leads to a
loss of error rates of about 45% relative. However,
the degradation is not higher than 35% if phrases and
morpho-syntactic information are available in addi-
tion to the reduced corpus.
The use of the phrases can improve the transla-
tion quality to some extent, especially for the sys-
tems with the reduced training corpus, but these im-
provements are less remarkable than those obtained
by replacing words with the base forms.
The best system with the complete corpus as well
as the best one with the reduced corpus use the
phrases and the transformed Serbian corpus where
the verb treatment has been applied.
4.2.2 Translation from English into Serbian
Table 4 shows results for the translation from En-
glish into Serbian. As expected, all error rates are
higher than for the other translation direction. Trans-
lation into the morphologically richer language al-
ways has poorer quality because it is difficult to find
the correct inflection.
The performance of the reduced corpus is de-
graded for about 40% relative for the baseline sys-
tem and for about 30% when the phrases are used
and the transformation of the English corpus has
been applied.

The importance of the phrases seems to be larger
for this translation direction. Removing the English
articles does not have the significant role for the
translation systems with full corpus, but for the re-
duced corpus it has basically the same effect as the
use of phrases. The best system with the reduced
corpus has been built with the use of phrases and
removal of the articles.
Table 7 shows some examples of the translation
into Serbian with and without English articles. Al-
though these effects are not directly obvious, it can
be seen that removing of the redundant information
enables better learning of the relevant information
so that system is better capable of producing seman-
tically correct output. The first example illustrates
an syntactically incorrect output with the wrong in-
flection of the verb (?c?itam? means ?I read?). The
output of the system without articles is still not com-
pletely correct, but the semantic is completely pre-
served. The second example illustrates an output
produced by the baseline system which is neither
syntactically nor semantically correct (?you have I
drink?). The output of the new system still has an
error in the verb, informal form of ?you? instead of
the formal one, but nevertheless both the syntax and
semantics are correct.
4.2.3 Translation of the External Text
Translation results for the external test can be
seen in Table 5. As expected, the high number of
out-of-vocabulary words results in very high error
rates. Certain improvement is achieved with the
phrases, but the most significant improvements are
yielded by the use of Serbian base forms and re-
moval of English articles. Verb treatment in this case
does not outperform the base forms system, prob-
ably because there are not so many different verb
forms as in the other corpus, and only a small num-
ber of pronouns is missing.
5 Conclusions
In this work, we have examined the possibilities
for building a statistical machine translation system
with a small bilingual Serbian-English parallel text.
Our experiments showed that the translation results
for this language pair are comparable with results for
other language pairs, especially if the small size of
the corpus, unrestricted domain and rich inflectional
morphology of Serbian language are taken into ac-
count. With the baseline system, we obtained about
45% WER for translation into English and about
53% for translation into Serbian.
We have systematically investigated the impact of
the corpus size on translation quality, as well as the
importance of additional bilingual knowledge in the
form of short phrases. In addition, we have shown
that morpho-syntactic information is a valuable lan-
guage resource for translation of this language pair.
Depending on the availability of resources and
tools, we plan to examine parallel texts with other
languages, and also to do further investigations on
this language pair. We believe that more refined use
of the morpho-syntactic information can yield better
results (for example the hierarchical lexicon model
proposed in (Nie?en and Ney, 2001)). We also be-
lieve that the use of the conventional dictionaries
could improve the Serbian-English translation.
