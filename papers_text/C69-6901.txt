Non-stylistic studies of The Book of Isaiah have given 
rise to several hypotheses concerning the authorship and 
integrity of this Hebrew text. In this paper we establish 
some stylistic criteria for the confirmation or refutation 
of these hypotheses. 
Clustering methods were found to be a useful addition 
to the conventional statistical methods. The chapters of the 
book are presented as points in an n-dimensional Euclidean 
space, where ~ is optionally determined. The co-ordinates 
of these points present statistical and other measures of 
the morphological features of the words of the appropriate 
chapters. Clustering methods were applied to these points.
