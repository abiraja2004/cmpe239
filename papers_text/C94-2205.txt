1. Introduction 
This article describes an experiment approaching syntactical analysis of l'ortuguese based on 
Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) \[JOSltl 75\]. It briefly presents the TAG formalism, placing 
it among other description tbrmalisms used for natural language processing, and introduces a
prototype which is being developed in order to validate application of this formalism to 
Portuguese language. 
The present work concerns entence analysis at syntaclical evel, which can be viewed as a 
process with two main ftmctions for natural language processing : the identification of the 
input components hrough association of tree structures to sentences, and regularization of the 
identified structure in order to minimize the number of trees for each sentence \[GR1StlMAN 
86\]. 
Although Context-Free Grammars (CFG) have been the most studied ones in order to describe 
natural language, purely context-fiee granlmars are not adequate for this description \[R/Ctt 
91\]. 
Context-Sensitive Grammars (CSG) are also used for description of natural languages, 
however they have not been proven to be a suitable tbmmlism ~br stating most grammatical 
constraints \[GRISHMAN 86\]. 
/Z.~ 
Categorial Grammars (CG) seem to be a tendency for natural language description, including 
several related formalisms, all involved with the foundations of modern syntactic and semantics 
theories \[STEEDMAN 93\]. 
Among the formalisms related to Categorial Grammars we can mention Tree Adjoining 
Grammars (TAGs) \[JOSHI 75\] \[JOSHI 85\], Lexical Functional Grammar \[BRESNAN 82\], 
Dependency Grammar \[HUDSON 82\] and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar \[GAZDAR 
85\]. These grammatical formalisms and linguistic theories are based on unification and 
specification of constraints for definition of the possible structures to be unified. 
This article is organized in four items. After a brief introduction, we present the Tree 
Adjoining Grammars formalism, describing its main components and operations, We comment 
our steps toward construction of a syntactical analyzer for Portuguese language and make 
some consideration about the prototype described. 
2. Tree Adjoining Grammars 
Tree Adjoining Grammars were first described by \[JOSHI 75\], as a tree based system, where 
the basic component is a set of elementa,3, trees. Each tree represents a minimal linguistic 
structure and is a domain of locality. A TAG comprises two kinds of elemental 3,trees: 
initial trees, which are complete structures, with pre-terminals on the leaves; 
auxiliary trees, which must have exactly one leaf node with the same syntactic ategory 
of the root node. 
The elementary trees localize dependencies, like agreement, sub categorization, etc. and must 
have at least one terminal node. 
Sentences generated from a language defined by a TAG can be derived by the composition of 
an initial tree and elementary trees, through two operations: substitution and adjunction. 
Substitution, as showed in Fig 1, inserts an initial tree (oi- a tree derived fiom an initial tree) on 
tile correspondent leaf node in the elementary tree. 
Adjunction, as showed in Fig 2, inserts an auxiliary tree on the correspondent node in an 
elementary or derived tree.

The adjunction operation can be recursive, then an auxiliary tree can receive adjunction in 
itself. Adjunction allows an insertion of a complete structure on a node of another complete 
structure. 
Adjunction makes TAGs a little more powerful then Context-Free Grammars (CFG), placing it 
in a class of grammars called Midly Context-Sensitive Grammars \[JOSHI 85\]. This operation 
preserves the dependencies among unbounded structures of the sentence. 
3. Portuguese analysis with TAGs 
Several research groups are working with Tree Adjoining Grammars. There are descriptions of 
grammars for French \[ABEILLE 91\], English \[SCHABES 88\], a study for German 
\[RAMBOW 92\], among other languages. 
In order to analyze Portuguese language, there are many studies being developed, in Brazil and 
Portugal, which approach different formalisms. These researches focus punctual areas as 
lexical analysis \[COURTIN 89\], data-base queries using natural anguage \[BIGOLIN 93\], 
semantic analysis \[FREITAS 93\] \[LUZ 93\], etc. 
In TAG tbrlnalism we can find aspects that help syntactic analysis of Portuguese, tbr example, 
the possibility to have unboundness dependencies, such as agreement, among nodes. 
Jog\[o, quc fala porhlgu~s, csluda informfitica. l 
We are working on a grammar to describe Portuguese, and we are developing a syntactical 
analyzer for this grammar. One of the problems we t~aced was the absence of a description of 
7257 
the most common structures used for our language, something as "fimdamental Portuguese", 
so we selected the subset o work with. 
We decided by a large subset, which includes active and passive voice, relative and 
interrogative clauses, auxiliary and support verbs, and clitic pronouns. 
The syntactical categories included are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, articles 
and prepositions. For each one of the categories there are syntactical traits associated like: 
concrete, abstract, number, gender, person, mode, voice, ... 
The grammar is organized according to the formalism, using initial trees and auxiliary trees to 
describe surface structures of Portuguese language. These study was based on Portuguese 
normative grammars \[ROCHA LIMA 92\], and generative grammars \[LOBATO 86\]. 
Example of initial trees : 
S / \  
N V 
i I 
Jo~o corre 
S 
W N V N 
Porque Jogo estuda Intbrmfitica? 
Example of auxiliary trees :
Adj 
Adj N Art N 
I I L 
belo gato o gato belo 
adj \ 
A~U 
pequeno 
Its important to observe that each one of the nodes associated to a tree has traits used t'or 
unification, and can have dependency traits between unbounded nodes. These dependency 
traits are kept under an adjunction operation. 
The first version of the syntactical analyzer, based upon TAGs, includes the acquisition of 
1258 
elementary trees, input of the sentence to be analyzed, construction era solution tree (made by 
adjunctkm and substitution), and unification of the input sentence with the solution tree. Note 
that the analyzer must return all the derived trees tbr the given input sentence. 
The elementary trees are supposed to contain intbrmation about the hierarchy of the nodes, 
type of that tree (relative, interrogative,...), operations that can be made on each node, and 
traits to be unified 
Syntactical analyzer input sentence comes fl'om a morphological analyzer that splits this 
sentence in components such as words or expressions, associating them a set of traits. 
Construction of the deriw,'d tree is made by adjunction and substitution operations over 
elementary trees. Unification compares traits of the input sentence with the traits described on 
TAG trees, producing the resulting trees. 
Inclusion of semantic traits will allow us to upgrade this analyzer in a semantic-syntactic 
analyzer, anticipating evahmtion of semantic traits to syntactical nalysis, reducing the number 
of resulting trees. 
4. Final remarks 
In the scope of a project aiming to develop tools to treat Portuguese at morphological, 
syntactic and semantic levels, we started with lnorphological level, and we calne to an 
implementation f a robust lexical-morphological analyzer through trie trees \[STRUBE DE 
LIMA 93\]. As a next step, we approached syntactical level looking for a tbrmalism adequate to 
support Portuguese language. A large subset ot' this language was outlined, which should give 
rise to an experiment of implementation of algorithms and data structures for parsing 
Portuguese. 
This seems to be the fhst study using Tree Adjoining Granunars for Portuguese language. Our 
contribution would state on description ol'a large subset of the language, construction of" trees 
that represent syntactic structures for Pomtgucse, and development of a parser, according to 
the formalism. 
We described around 300 inicial trees in order to cover the subset outlined, and developed a
bottom-up LR parser working efficiently. We are now studying complementary data structures 
as a syntactical dictionary in order to improve the parser. This dictionary would be hcll)ful to 
construct the solution tree, searching \['astly the trees that can be used tbr a word. We are also 
1259 
adapting the output of  the morphological analyzer in a model that fits the input o f  the 
syntactical analyzer developed. 
Tree Adjoining Grammars formalism, to this moment, seems to present aspects that benefit 
treatment o f  Portuguese language in a robust way. Acquisition of  new trees can be made 
easily, as well as describing semantic traits together with the syntactical ones.
